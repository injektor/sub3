<i>He used to be in such demand.
What happened to him?</i>

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,720
<i>What is he doing?</i>

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,020
<i>He's not a high school girl!
He's a pervert!</i>

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,050

Honey!

24
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,350
Mom.

Bong Pal.

26
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,040
Why don't you ever
play with your friends?

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,250
You're always playing by
yourself in the corner.

28
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,690
Let's go.

29
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,450
Look.

30
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,380

play with your friends.

Please forgive me! I'm sorry!

37
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,240
I'm sorry, lady!
Please forgive me!

41
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,830
What has he been up to all night?
Why is he just coming in?

42
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,610
Hey.

43
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,670
What took you so long?
I've been waiting for a long time.

44
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,460
What's with you?
How did you know to come here?

45
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,630
Did you forget?
I'm a ghost.

46
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,620
So why did you come here?

47
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,120
I just need to confirm one thing,
so just hold on, okay?

48
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,980
- What are you doing?
- Just hold still for a second, okay?

49
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,520
- How dare you get fresh with me!
- Hey!

50
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,760
- What?
- I need to check something, okay?

51
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,450
Give me a break and what's
with the disrespectful language?

52
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,170
You're obviously way younger than me.

53
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,520
Thanks for thinking that I'm young,
but it's been five years since I died.

54
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,040
You're just a college sophmore.
I'm older than you.

55
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,500
You're older than me?

56
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,130
Forget it.
Why do I bother to even talk to you?

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,010
I'm tired. Go away.

58
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,730
You're so annoying.

59
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,440
Ah, I forgot.

60
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,800
What's this?

61
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,990
Ta-da.

62
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,890
Who said you could come in here?

63
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,170
Can't you just say "thank you"?

64
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,700
Thank you very much.
Now please leave.

65
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,160
You're actually quite
tidier than you look.

66
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,200
Please go. Go.

67
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,220
So do me this one favor.

68
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,490
It's not hard to do. All you have
to do is just close your eyes.

69
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,550
Forget it. You're not the first
ghost to nag and plead like that.

70
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,870
I don't what you're up to,
but look for someone else.

71
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,020
Should I introduce you?

72
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,870
All I need is you.

73
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,840
Help me out just this once!
Please? Please? Come on!

74
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,120
No! No! No!

75
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,860
And you're pretty
shameless for a ghost.

76
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,350
You didn't even pay
me my 10 million won.

77
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,190
Can't believe you're upset
over a measly 10 million won.

78
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,000
A measly... a measly 10 million won?

79
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,790
I know I left a charm that
exorcised ghosts in here.

80
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,980
Here it is.

81
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,900
Take this!

82
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,920
Don't touch that. We won't be
able to get the AS if you break it.

83
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,920
We lost everything else,
so let's be careful with that.

84
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,010
Should we just get the AS?

85
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,910
Chun Sang!
Chung Sang, I found it! I found it!

86
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,720
Wow! I was right, wasn't I?
He just hit a ghost, right?

87
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,950
- We didn't see wrong, right?
- I think so. I'm not sure.

88
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,270
I'm right! That's a ghost right there!

89
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,980
- You saw it too.
- Right, I did see it.

90
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,180
This guy can really see ghosts.

91
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,030
He threw a solid punch
right to that ghost's face.

92
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,610
Wow, our junior is no joke!

93
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,950
But Chun Sang, we saw the ghost too.

94
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,120
What's the matter with you?
That was a silver code!

95
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,510
Oh yeah... silver code?

96
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,690
When a person is in the grips of
terror, they can see the ghost.

97
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,540
The moment where that ghost and you
connect is called the silver code.

98
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,820
- Ah, silver code!
- Are you not going to study?

99
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,790
Are you the vice president
of this club or not?

100
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,020
I am.

101
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,830
The thing is, our junior isn't
seeing ghosts with the silver code.

102
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,660
Look. He's staring right at the ghost.

103
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,690
That's why he can fight
against the ghosts!

104
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,150
Wow! Wow, I really want to recruit him.

105
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,530
Hey, does he go to our school?

106
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,000
Hurry up and find him.
We can't lose him! Find him!

107
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,540
- Already?
- Yes.

108
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,310
Sophmore economics major, Park Bong Pal.

109
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,620
- Hello!
- Hey there!

110
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,970
He's so cool. Now that is what
a man is supposed to look like.

111
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,750
What are you? A squid?

112
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,370
Hey, you should get a dog too.

113
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,660
What is this? You look sad
and pathetic eating alone.

114
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,060
Dog my butt.

115
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,980
You're so rude.

116
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,520
It's just how I am.

117
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,810
I love rolled eggs!

118
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,440
Go and buy some for yourself.

119
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,670
Come to think of it, you keep
forgetting that I'm a ghost.

120
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,640
How am I supposed to buy it? I can't!

121
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,150
Ghosts can only eat food
that is given to them.

122
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,730
Haven't you done ancestral rites before?

123
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,140
Oh.

124
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,420
Now that you know, give me
a piece of that egg and rice ball.

125
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,940
Oh, sure. Here. Here you go.

126
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,600
Seriously, it's so good.

127
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,160
- Goodness, you're eating alone again.
- How sad.

128
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,110
Let's formally introduce ourselves.

129
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,220
I'm a junior physical education
major and my name is Choi Chun Sang.

130
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm Choi Chun Sang...

131
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,650
And this is...

132
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,250
I'm a junior computer science
major and my name is Kim In Rang.

133
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,010
- And?
- And...

134
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,440
What do you mean "and"?

135
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,220
Didn't we overcome
that terror the other day, my brother?

136
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,960
We saw it. We saw your courageous
battle against that ghost!

137
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,260
So...

138
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,410
How about we do this together?

139
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,960
Let's destroy this darkness together!

140
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,330
I don't want to.

141
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,690
- He's stubborn.
- He's tough.

142
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,320
That was refreshing.

143
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
- You're sweating.
- Am I?

144
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Yes.

145
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,120
Wow, there's a lot of students in here.

146
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,160
My attendance list has 22 students, but
I see the waitlisted ones are here too.

147
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,790
Yes.

148
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,650
My class won't be fun.
I think your expectations are too high.

149
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,660
I'll introduce myself first.

150
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,460
Due to personal reasons, Professor Lee
Ji Sung will no longer teach this class.

151
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,520
Therefore, I will be taking over
for the rest of the semester.

152
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,300
I'm Joo Hye Sung, a veterinary professor
at this school. It's nice to meet you.

153
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,550
Professor, you were
totally cool earlier.

154
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,970
Is your hand okay? It doesn't hurt?

155
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,960
Yes, I'm fine.

156
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,780
I feel like I've become a celebrity all
of a sudden. It's a bit embarrassing.

157
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, let's start class.

158
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,740
The enrolled students might be distracted
so I ask the rest of you to leave please.

159
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,940
I'll see you guys next semester.

160
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,170
Yes, 22 students is the perfect
size for a class, don't you think?

161
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm going to call each of your names.

162
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,980
- No Hyun Joo.
- Here.

163
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,490
It's nice to meet you.

164
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,340
- Park Bong Pal.
- Here.

165
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,190
- Im Seo Hyun.
- Here.

166
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,090
It's nice to meet you.

167
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,810
Jung Shi Ah.

168
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,660
- Here.
- Are you happy?

169
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,160
Oh, she's pretty.

170
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,650
You like girls like Im Seo Hyun, huh?
All slender and willowy.

171
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,900
Please go!

172
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,450
- Do you have nowhere to go?
- No, I don't.

173
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,260
You're seriously driving me crazy!

174
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,780
You, over there.

175
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,590
Student Park Bong Pal.

176
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,380
- Yes?
- Is there a problem?

177
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,670
No, I'm sorry.

178
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,610
Okay, let's continue.

179
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,710
Na Jin Soo.

180
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,320
Here.

181
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,680
It's nice to meet you.

182
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,850
It's been a week
and the ranking... oh my god!

183
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,050
We're dropping like crazy! Why is
Sadako posting so many negative comments?

184
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,080
I don't think we'll even be able
to pay for the maintenance fees.

185
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,490
You scared me.

186
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,060
What are we to do then? Don't
you know how expensive that thing is?

187
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,300
<i>Is anyone inside?
I'm from the housing agency.</i>

188
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,250
<i>I know you're inside.
Please vacate the room by next week.</i>

189
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,510
<i>If you don't, we'll enter
without permission. Understood?</i>

190
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,220
- So what are we going to do now?
- What can we do?

191
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,060
We have to use any means
necessary to recruit Park Bong Pal.

192
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,570
Don't you think that'll be tough?

193
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,990
It seems like he's not very
close to his colleagues either.

194
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,000
Is he being ostracized?

195
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,860
I think he's the one
who's ostracizing them.

196
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,750
A lone ranger in this lonely world. He's
definitely the person we're looking for.

197
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,250
Just stick to him like glue no matter
what and tell him he's our savior.

198
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:05,280
It won't happen right away, but
he'll come around if we don't give up.

199
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,900
Once that happens...

200
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,780
The money and fame will
be falling from the skies.

201
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,740
Our popularity will go up.

202
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,620
And we'll have so many new
members joining our club.

203
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,430
- Among those members...
- Tons of them will be girls.

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,920
- They cut off the electricity.
- It's so dark.

205
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,300
- First class was great.
- Thank you.

206
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,470
The first class is always hard.

207
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,330
Ah, I hear there is a student that
helps with this class. Who is it?

208
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,110
It's me.

209
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,980
- Im Seo Hyun?
- Yes.

210
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,930
I'm sure it's tough preparing
the lecture by yourself.

211
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,760
Is anyone willing to help out?

212
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,490
Here.

213
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,180
Park Bong Pal?

214
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,690
Then please go ahead
and help Im Seo Hyun out.

215
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,190
See you all next time. Good job.

216
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,410
Thank you.

217
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,090
You're a junior in our major, right?
Sophmore economics major?

218
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,170
- Yes.
- You don't know me very well, do you?

219
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,400
- We're in the same major.
- He knows you very well!

220
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,760
I don't really attend the major events.

221
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,140
Liar.

222
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,330
I'm Im Seo Hyun.
Senior economics major.

223
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,700
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

224
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,320
Great, I look forward
to working with you.

225
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,060
Yes.

226
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,950
It's all because of me.
Don't forget it.

227
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,640
You know you like it!

228
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,590
Eat carefully. You eat so well.

229
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,460
You must've been very hungry.

230
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,220
Professor, I was looking for you.

231
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,490
What for?

232
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,650
The previous professor asked
me to take care of this file.

233
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,600
I don't know what to do with it.

234
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,680
I'll take it and give it to him.

235
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,480
Thank you.

236
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,190
Hey, eat slowly.

237
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,030
Isn't he the dog that bit your hand?

238
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,260
You're quite famous, aren't you?
You're famous for being evil.

239
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,700
He's so cute.
Are you going to raise him now?

240
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,020
No, I'm keeping him temporarily
until the owner comes for him.

241
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,760
If not, then I'm going to take
him to the hospital tomorrow.

242
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,370
Yes, this is Joo Hye Sung.

243
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,970
<i>Professor, it's two
hours before the seminar.</i>

244
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,250
<i>You're not in the waiting
room. Where are you?</i>

245
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,720
Ah, I'm at the school right now.
I'm sorry, I'll leave right now.

246
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Yes.

247
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:26,250
I'm sorry, but if you have time,
can you watch over him until he's done?

248
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,140
There's medicine mixed inside,
so he has to eat all of it.

249
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,750
- You just have to watch him.
- Okay.

250
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,160
- Thank you.
- Sure.

251
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,100
You have to eat all of it, okay?

252
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,680
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

253
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,900
No, I didn't make it.

254
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,190
I'm going to head to the hospital.

255
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,050
My shoulders feel so stiff.
I'm thinking of getting a physical exam.

256
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,360
Honey, your skin is so great!

257
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,850
- Kyung Ja!
- Hyun Ji, what are you doing here?

258
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,830
- I'm following someone.
- Who?

259
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,390
He's... I'll tell you later.
See you soon.

260
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,150
See you.

261
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:38,174

262
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,070
Honey!

263
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,070
Taxi! Taxi! Oh my, honey!

264
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,330
It's crazy hot. Why are
you working out so hard?

265
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,950
That ghost yesterday
must've really gotten to you.

266
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,330
Shut up and leave!

267
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,080
It's better to work out together.

268
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,440
Who's going to work out with you?

269
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,610
Stop playing and come down.

270
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,180
Gosh, you're pretty weak for a guy.

271
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,250
That's why you're
always getting beaten up.

272
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,600
- Besides, I'm so light.
- Yeah right. Come down!

273
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,500
Hey, aren't you hungry?
I'm hungry.

274
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,790
Let's go down and order some
fried chicken! What do you think?

275
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:48,200
I bet it's so good! Chicken! Chicken!

276
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,240
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

277
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,150
- Hey!
- Chicken!

278
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,710
Hey!

279
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,810
- Hey!
- Catch me if you can!

280
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,960
- I swear!
- Come and get me!

281
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,630
Goodness, poor soul.

282
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,270
- What a pity.
- Someone died over there again.

283
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,590
- Where? At Gampo?
- Yes.

284
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:05,490
I'm sure he died because of
the ghost that haunts there!

285
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:10,690
You know, that girl who came from
the coffee shop a long time ago.

286
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,680
- Eun Shil?
- Yes, Eun Shil!

287
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,860
They discovered her
dead body in the closet.

288
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,210
That wretched husband of
hers beat her to death.

289
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,650
Right, and ever since,
people have been dying there!

290
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,330
Her husband got stabbed
there and died too.

291
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,350
- It serves him right!
- Exactly.

292
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,380
Oh my gosh! Who are you?

293
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,530
Where is this Gampo place?

294
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,070
Go over there!

295
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,580
Goodness, you scared me.

296
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,810
- The head is the best part.
- Oh my gosh.

297
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,780
- Who is he?
- I have no idea.

298
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,280
Seriously, who is he?

299
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,090
I'm telling you it's fine!
What's wrong with all of you?

300
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,840
Goodness, what is going on here?

301
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,550
Goodness, I'm so sorry!

302
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,640
No, it's quite all right.

303
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,260
- By any chance, are you Monk Myung Chul?
- Yes.

304
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,390
- I'm Monk Myung Chul.
- What took you so long?

305
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,650
Please go inside.

306
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,150
Goodness, the energy of this place!

307
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,660
So this is where the person died.

308
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,150
- And it was yesterday?
- Yes, that's correct!

309
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,090
How did you know that?
They say you're old news...

310
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,690
No, you're very courageous.

311
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,610
Anyway, something bad happens
whenever you go inside there.

312
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,800
Rumors are spreading and I'm so upset!

313
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,070
Monk, I leave it up to you.

314
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,890
I understand. Let's see here.

315
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,680
- What is that?
- Do you see something?

316
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,450
I feel a menacing energy.

317
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,240
I feel a woman's energy.

318
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,860
There's a story, too.

319
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,920
Her name is... Eun Shil?

320
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,130
- Eun Shil?
- Is she in there?

321
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,280
- You can see that too?
- Hush!

322
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:48,150
I didn't put you in
a bad position, did I?

323
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,710
It's simple.

324
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,000
Just in case, please step back.

325
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes.

326
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,700
Lady! Lady, call the shaman!
Call the shaman!

327
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,400
<i>Lady!</i>

328
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,270
<i>[STAR VETERINARY HOSPITAL]</i>

329
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,830
Doctor, you're here.

330
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,030
Oh my, who is this?

331
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,210
He's a new member of the family.
Please give him some vitamins.

332
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,530
You're a little late.

333
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,460
I had to go to school because of him.

334
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,800
- Is the surgery room ready?
- Yes.

335
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,310
- I'm going to change my clothes.
- Okay.

336
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:21,040
At this rate, we're going to be a safe
house instead of a veterinary clinic.

337
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,980
We're spending more money on
food than on hospital supplies.

338
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,130
What if we end up going bankrupt?

339
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,190
I know.

340
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,870
Come here. Goodness.

341
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,270
You're so adorable.
Where did you come from?

342
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,660
Bong Pal, wait for me!

343
00:30:27,684 --> 00:30:39,684

344
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,440
Just that one...

345
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,380
Hey, please give me one bite.

346
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,520
Look at that over there.
It's going fast.

347
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,740
I also want to ride it.

348
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,990
Can you make kimchi stew
instead of bean paste stew?

349
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,980
I have a knife in my hand,
so be quiet.

350
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,710
Kimchi stew and rolled eggs, please?

351
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,160
Can you please go away?

352
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,420
Can't you go home
and whine there? Why me?

353
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,340
I said I had nowhere to go.

354
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,340
I don't remember my home or my mom.

355
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,340
I don't know why I died, either.

356
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,700
That's why I've been stealing food
from memorial services for others.

357
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,240
Do you know how sad it is to do so?

358
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,580
This one time, I got bitten
by a dog at this house.

359
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,080
Don't you feel bad for me?

360

361
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,950

but he used to be really good.

365

I don't know what he might do to you.

366
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,890
Gosh.

367
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,700
I thought you'd be away
for a few more days.

368
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,350
Here is a present for you.

369
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,390
What happened to your face?

370
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,120
Well, I have my reasons.

371
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,680
I may have to stay with you
for a few more days.

372
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,970
I'm sensing this strange energy here.

373
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,810
Well, who could this be?

374
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,920
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

375
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,940
Sure.

376

Have a seat.

377

You're not even a kid.

378
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,470
Why did your face get all beaten up?

379
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,210
This sausage tastes good.

I hope you stop trying to exorcise.

382
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,540
It's not something
you should consider lightly.

383
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,480
If so, can you lend me some money?

384
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,580
About 90 million.

385
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,290
Let's just eat.

386
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,870
Can I have some of that too?

387
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,980
Where are you going
in the middle of dinner?

388
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
I want to grill more sausage.

389
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,210
- We have plenty left here.
- It's not for you.

390

There is a stray cat around here.

391
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,680
What kind of stray cat
comes up to the fourth floor?

392
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,290
There is this wicked cat.

I'm all happy now.

396
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,120
We will see you tomorrow.

397
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,680
Sure, have a good evening.

398
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,980
I will wrap up here, so go ahead.

399
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,810

- Have a good night.

- Yes.

Ah, thank you for what you did yesterday.

409
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,120
No problem. It was nothing.

Ah...

Not yet. We have to find someone nice.

00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,830
By the way, can you keep
this location from other students?

414
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,750
I understand.

415
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,430

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,020

This is why he doesn't give me a chance.

425
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,250
That way, I can confirm something.

426
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,790

- No.

I do work. Actually, I live in Unit 402.

- What else should I bring up then?
- You could just say nothing.

I know you'll steal the box
while you pretend to do so.

476
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,210
- Why do you keep saying that I'd steal?
- That's how you look.

477
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,000
Leave it here! Oh my.

478
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,520

Why get so worked up?

484
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,460
I didn't get all worked up.
I simply said I lived in Unit 402.

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,980
- You know the tall boy...
- Did she leave?

486
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,850
I was trying to find this letter here...

487
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,430
She's nowhere to be seen.

488
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,100
I didn't see it. That's why...

489
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,460
The boy has been living here for years.

490
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,180
I told him to say hi
to his neighbors and all...

491
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,390
He's been by himself.

- You're welcome.

You're in a good mood, huh?

501
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,020
I was until I saw you.

502
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,310
What do you mean?
I'm happy to see you.

503
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,830
- It's good that you're happy.
- Of course, it's a good thing.

504
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,250
You even have no shame, huh?

505
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,500
- I'm even pretty too.
- Stop kidding me.

506
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,460
With your face? I don't agree.

507
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,160
Go away so I can study.

508
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,730
He's started to scare me now.

509
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,810
He's talking to someone, right?

510
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,480
Yes, it seems he's talking to a ghost.

511
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,770
Wow.

512
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,290

00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,480
Well, why don't I come by
in two hours then?

517
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,600
All right then.

518
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,680
What is it?
Why are you suddenly all happy?

519
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,500
I'm going to work now.
Don't follow me.

520
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,270
I'm coming.

521
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,980
Seriously! I told you not to follow me!

522
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,040
Gosh.

523
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,310
Please don't follow me.
I'm begging you, please.

524
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,960
Then why don't you do me a favor first?

525
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
Forget I said anything.

526
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,430
Chun Sang, he was just talking
to a ghost again, wasn't he?

527
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,540
I think so...

528
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,310
I got goosebumps all over,
but I like him.

529
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,730
- Let's go.
- Seriously. How does he do that?

530
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,710
Why didn't he fix this broken washer?

531
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,430
He should fix the broken doorbell, too.

532
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,350
Why doesn't he fix things? How lazy!

533
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,450
By the way, where did I leave my sword?

534
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,310
Did Bong Pal take it by any chance?

535
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,060
He wouldn't have taken it.

536
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,750
Oh my goodness.

537
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,660
It's there.

538
00:45:48,684 --> 00:46:00,684

539
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,180
He's moving.

540
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,160
Why does he keep coming
to a place like this? It's spooky.

541
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,450
Should we take one and start?

542
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,450
Shall we?

543
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,520
Well... here it is.

544
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,500
Let's go.

545
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,750
Oh my, who do we have here? The exorcist?

546
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,950
What? Are you the exorcist I called?

547
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,770
- Correct. I'm Park Bong Pal.
- Well...

548
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,890
Aren't you too young
to do this kind of work?

549
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,500
You look like a student.

550
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,290
Are you sure you can do this?

551
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,560
Buy yourself some clothes, will you?

552
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,410
You don't look convincing
because you go around looking like this.

553
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,000
Well, just let me do the job.

554
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,210
What if you take off with the deposit
like the monk yesterday?

555
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,180
I will find that monk and kick his butt.

556
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,520
I'm totally different
from those con artists.

557
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,890
I will get paid after the job
is done, so don't worry.

558
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,850
You can wire the money
after you see the job is completely done.

559
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,660
All right then.
I like the way you do business.

560
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,960
Room One over there.

561
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
I'm counting on you.

562
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,410
Now Ghostnet has returned.

563
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,210
Sorry that we're airing
this without any notice.

564
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,730
This has never been done in Korea.

565
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:55,500
Now we're starting a live broadcast.

566
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,250
Follow follow me.

567
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:48,960
- What's happening?
- I don't know. Just keep rolling.

568
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,830
<i>Go now.</i>

569
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,310
<i>Run away now! Hurry.</i>

570
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,210
Go in there.

571
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,560
<i>Want to die, huh?</i>

572
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,810
<i>Go in there, damn it!</i>

573
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:36,120
Gosh, it's even scarier here at night.

574
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,370
What was I thinking?

575
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,480
I'm back here
because I left my sword behind.

576
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,410
Oh my.

577
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,560
Fine. I will come back
when the sun rises tomorrow morning.

578
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,180
He's fighting with a ghost, isn't he?

579
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,660
It looks that way.

580
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,910
<i>What a show.
Did they hire an actor for this?</i>

581
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,870
<i>He might win the Oscar.</i>

582
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,870
How do they think this is a show?

583
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,500
Please don't say this is a show.

584
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,480
We're actually filming a ghost now.

585
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,350
This is a live broadcast,
so don't interrupt us.

586
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,060
We're scared to death now.

587
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,810
What's happening?

588
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,500
Mister, you're dead!

589
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,500
Mister, you're dead!

590
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,770
- Are you okay?
- Yes, are you okay?

591
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,520
It's not there!

592
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,250
Bong Pal, attack his side!

593
00:53:23,274 --> 00:53:35,274

594
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,180
Hey.

595
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,100
She was trapped here
because of that jerk earlier.

596
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,480
Bong Pal, you did well today.

597
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,460
You knocked down an evil ghost
and sent her away to a good place.

598
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,750
Come on, don't be shy.

599
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,520
Let's go.

600
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,790
Why is this here?

601
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,620
Hey.

602
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,810
Like this time and the last time...

603
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,620
how did you know
the weakness of the ghost so well?

604
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,040
- You can see it?
- What if I can?

605
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,460
Do you want me to tell you how?

606
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,930
- Yes, please.
- I don't want to.

607
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,120
Hey, why do you keep
following me around?

608
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,270
- You don't happen to like me, do you?
- No way.

609
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:56,790
- Then you're trying to drain my energy?
- No way.

610
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:00,620
Then why do you keep
following me around like a dog?

611
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,810
- I don't have any memories from my past.
- Memories?

612
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,680
Ah, you mentioned you
didn't have memories last time.

613
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,950
- Is that true?
- Yes.

614
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,830
I don't remember anything such as...

615
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,450
why I died, where my home was,
and who my parents were.

616
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:20,290
But for the first time after five years,
I got this glimpse of memories.

617
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,100
When you and I did...

618
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,890
- What about last time?
- You know last time...

619
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,160
I got my memories back then.

620
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,270
That's why I'm trying to do it again...

621
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,930
When and what did we do?

622
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,000
You know what it is.

623
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,980
- I still don't know what it is.
- Last time...

624
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,660
Gosh, just forget it.

Gosh, where did I leave that sword?

643
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,000
I can't remember.

644

Envelopes for medicine?

645
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,060
Did someone take it and commit suicide?

646
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,370
- Who are you?
- He's a monk.

647
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,410
Ah.
