6
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:13,213
<font color="yellow">- Huh?
- How do I look? Is it okay?</font>

7
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:16,138
<font color="yellow">Well... the dress is pretty.</font>

8
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:26,800
<font color="yellow">It's pretty.</font>

- To where?</font>

<font color="yellow">To work.</font>

11
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:41,486
<font color="yellow">- What?
- It's time to pay your dues.</font>

12
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,932

this late at night?</font>

- Again?</font>

24
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,438
<font color="yellow">- I can't. I am way too tired.
- No, they want us to come immediately.</font>

25
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,232
<font color="yellow">Don't you think this is too much?</font>

26
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:23,238
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired that I hit my head on the
door because I couldn't go through it.</font>

- No.</font>

28

tomorrow. Don't you remember our deal?</font>

<font color="yellow">Still, this is wrong!</font>

30
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:35,687
<font color="yellow">You're working me like a slave
because of this one dress you bought me.</font>

31
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:38,879
<font color="yellow">And you said you're going to tutor me.
When are we going to start studying?</font>

32
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,219
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay.
Let's study after we're done, okay?</font>

33
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:44,880
<font color="yellow">- No, I refuse to go.
- Where are you going? Let's go.</font>

34
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,751
<font color="yellow">- I'm tired.
- Hurry up.</font>

35
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:59,546
<font color="yellow">It's completely trashed in here.
When are we going to clean all this up?</font>

to have a fit if they find out.</font>

37
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,448
<font color="yellow">You're lucky you're still alive
and breathing. You should be grateful.</font>

38
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,780
<font color="yellow">I am. I will be forever grateful
and... it's time to pray.</font>

39
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,301
<font color="yellow">Dear God, Buddha, Allah,
thank you so much...</font>

40

<font color="yellow">No!</font>

41
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:21,779
<font color="yellow">No, I should be thanking
Bong Pal instead!</font>

42
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,152
<font color="yellow">He may be a jerk, but he
came when I needed him most.</font>

43
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,626
<font color="yellow">He's a real man.</font>

44
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,626
<font color="yellow">How do you think
he knew I was in danger?</font>

45
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:33,669
<font color="yellow">Well, the thing is...</font>

46
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:36,001
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

47
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:39,919
<font color="yellow">- Oh, it's Bong Pal.
- He texted you?</font>

48
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,488
<font color="yellow">Is he asking if I'm okay or something?</font>

49
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:45,385
<font color="yellow">He's cool. He's a pretty decent guy.</font>

50
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,794
<font color="yellow">- No, it's not that.
- What did he say? Let me see.</font>

51
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,852
<font color="yellow"><i>Please deposit the money into my account.</i></font>

52
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,813
<font color="yellow">What is he talking about? What account?</font>

53
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:02,123
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal says he charges
one million won per exorcism.</font>

54
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,755
<font color="yellow">One million...</font>

55
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,150
<font color="yellow">- What? One million won?
- Yes.</font>

56
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:11,594
<font color="yellow">Wait, let me get this straight.</font>

57
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:13,503
<font color="yellow">So... Bong....</font>

58
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:17,741
<font color="yellow">Mmm... so, Bong Pal really
didn't come to save me.</font>

59
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,460
<font color="yellow">- Correct.
- He's horrible.</font>

60
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,993
<font color="yellow">- He's calculating.
- Do you have one million won?</font>

61
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:23,883
<font color="yellow">No, I do not.</font>

62
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:28,284
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do then?
He's not going to let this slide.</font>

63
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:34,347
<font color="yellow">I don't know, I don't know, I don't
know. Just ignore him! I don't know.</font>

64
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,859
<font color="yellow">Ignore him? I...</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh goodness.</font>

71
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:18,186
<font color="yellow">How long did I sleep?
I was so freaking tired.</font>

72
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:23,328
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal. Bong Pal.</font>

73

74
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:35,842
<font color="yellow">Sorry!</font>

75
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:42,493

I swear it!</font>

76
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:44,051
<font color="yellow">Will you please make some
noise when you roam around?</font>

77
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:45,351
<font color="yellow">I'm a ghost.
How am I supposed to do that?</font>

78
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:48,407

to burst in whenever you like.</font>

79
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,911
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

80
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:54,147
<font color="yellow">You know, you kind of
look different today.</font>

81
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:58,051
<font color="yellow">Your clothes look a bit tidy too.</font>

82
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:00,722
<font color="yellow">Did you do something
to your hair as well?</font>

83
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:02,779
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

84
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,596
<font color="yellow">Ah, you have the same class with her
today, don't you? I'm right, aren't I?</font>

85
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,316
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

86
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:10,657
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go. Don't follow me.</font>

87
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:13,322
<font color="yellow">Why? So you can have nice
and cozy class time with that girl?</font>

88
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,282
<font color="yellow">No. You said you're tired, so rest up.</font>

89
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:21,174
<font color="yellow">And do not go in this room or touch
anything without my permission.</font>

90
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,460
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

91

94
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,349
<font color="yellow">What the heck?
You just said goodbye to me.</font>

95
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,017
<font color="yellow">When? I never said that.</font>

96
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:42,195
<font color="yellow">Aren't you tired of following me?</font>

97
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,570
<font color="yellow">It's boring alone at home.</font>

98
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:48,195
<font color="yellow">And I can't stay home when
I'm wearing a pretty dress like this.</font>

99
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:51,746

106
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,039
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to know?</font>

107
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,351

- Ghost!</font>

108
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,957
<font color="yellow">What is it? What is it? What is it?</font>

109
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:47,879
<font color="yellow">Why are you in such a good mood?</font>

110
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,374
<font color="yellow">Just because. Don't I look like
a college student in this dress?</font>

111
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,555

someone I need to talk to.</font>

114
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, who are you meeting--</font>

115
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,375
<font color="yellow">I swear.</font>

116
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,731
<font color="yellow">Kyung Ja.</font>

117
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:13,506
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Ji!
- What brings you here?</font>

118
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:16,514
<font color="yellow">I told you last time that
my honey is at this school.</font>

119
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,004
<font color="yellow">Ah.</font>

120
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,528
<font color="yellow">Hey, your clothes...</font>

121
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,240
<font color="yellow">- How do I look?
- What do you think?</font>

122
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,146
<font color="yellow">You look totally pretty.</font>

123
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:31,250
<font color="yellow">You were pretty with your uniform on,
but you look even prettier in this dress.</font>

124
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:35,332
<font color="yellow">You're up there in the ranks of
Jeon Ji Hyun and Song Hye Gyo.</font>

125
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,068
<font color="yellow">Kyung Ja!</font>

126
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:40,293
<font color="yellow">You would look perfect with
a pair of high heels on.</font>

127
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:44,246
<font color="yellow">But who burned this dress for you?</font>

128
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:48,225
<font color="yellow">By any chance,
was it that blood sausage?</font>

129
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,428
<font color="yellow">I'm right, aren't I?</font>

130
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:55,377
<font color="yellow">What the heck? He kissed you last time
and now he burned this dress for you?</font>

131
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,029
<font color="yellow">I think he likes you.</font>

132
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,486
<font color="yellow">- That doesn't make sense.
- Oh my, why not?</font>

133
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,202
<font color="yellow">I'm a ghost and I have
feelings for a human.</font>

134
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,976
<font color="yellow">There's no rule that a human
can't have feelings for a ghost.</font>

135
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:10,962
<font color="yellow">It's not true. I had to
beg him to burn this dress for me.</font>

136
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:14,342
<font color="yellow">And Bong Pal likes someone else.</font>

137
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:19,951
<font color="yellow">You don't know because you haven't been
in a relationship with a guy before.</font>

138
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,549
<font color="yellow">My instincts tell me that
he likes you 100 percent.</font>

139
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,673
<font color="yellow">No, there's no way.</font>

140
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,737
<font color="yellow">- Who did you see?
- Just a ghost that I know.</font>

141
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,890
<font color="yellow"><i>My instincts tell me that
he likes you 100 percent.</i></font>

142
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:42,566
<font color="yellow">What's up?
Why are you smiling like that?</font>

143
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,072
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

144
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:46,548
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

145
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,079
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

146
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,828
<font color="yellow">- You're here early.
- Yes.</font>

147
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:53,182
<font color="yellow">- Let's prepare for class.
- Okay.</font>

148
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:55,516
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

149
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:00,016
<font color="yellow">How pretty.</font>

150
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:13,582
<font color="yellow">I'll take that.</font>

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,211
<font color="yellow">- It's fine. Thanks.
- No, I'll do it.</font>

152
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,124
<font color="yellow">Oh my, it's Superman.</font>

153
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:35,821
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's written all over
your face that you like her.</font>

154
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,530
<font color="yellow">What's the point when you
can't even talk to her properly?</font>

155
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,675
<font color="yellow">- Ah, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.</font>

156
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:50,240
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be embarrassed.</font>

157
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:52,525
<font color="yellow">You guys are here early.</font>

158
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:54,352
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

159
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:57,410
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming out
this early to help me.</font>

160
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,434
<font color="yellow">- Are those materials for today's class?
- Yes.</font>

161
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:08,038
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt? Those scratches...</font>

162
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,530
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's no big deal.</font>

163
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,952
<font color="yellow">- That looks painful.
- Goodness.</font>

164
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:17,040
<font color="yellow">I didn't bring the materials for class.</font>

165
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:33,924
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.
- Yeah?</font>

166
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:37,173
<font color="yellow">It seemed like
that professor avoided me earlier.</font>

167
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,494
<font color="yellow">You're being ridiculous.</font>

168
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:47,326
<font color="yellow">Did I see wrong?</font>

169
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,904
<font color="yellow">Why aren't these seniors
responding to my text?</font>

170
00:12:57,905 --> 00:13:01,399
<font color="yellow">Who? Ah, you mean that comedic duo?</font>

171
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,405
<font color="yellow">They looked penniless to me.
There's no way they're paying you.</font>

172
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:10,340
<font color="yellow"><i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i></font>

173
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:13,053
<font color="yellow">Seriously, these guys!</font>

174
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,126
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

175
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:24,485
<font color="yellow">What do you think it is?
They ran away.</font>

176
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:27,730
<font color="yellow">How can you say that right now?</font>

177
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:30,331
<font color="yellow">If I don't get paid, then
you have no means to pay off your debt.</font>

178
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:31,798
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

179
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,759
<font color="yellow">How dare they run away with our money!</font>

180
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,961
<font color="yellow">Hey, call them again. Hurry!</font>

181
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:39,105
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

182
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:45,005
<font color="yellow"><i>Facility maintenance fee is 892,000 won.</i></font>

183
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,130
<font color="yellow"><i>You have until
the 23rd to pay the office.</i></font>

184
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:52,033
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Maintenence bill of 892,000 won.</font>

- Exorcism fee of one million won.</font>

187
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:05,833
<font color="yellow">- He's really horrible.
- Hey, don't!</font>

188
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,487
<font color="yellow">892,000 won... how are we going
to secure all this money? Huh?</font>

189
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:17,654
<font color="yellow">I'm having a tough time as it is just
with the camera monthly payments.</font>

190
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,856
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can call my parents.</font>

191
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:23,951
<font color="yellow">- You really have nothing?
- I really have nothing.</font>

192
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,050
<font color="yellow">Ask someone who has money.
I've spent all of mine.</font>

193
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,593
<font color="yellow">Then call someone and borrow it.
Are you just going to sit and do nothing?</font>

194
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:32,644
<font color="yellow">All right! Okay!</font>

195
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:36,184
<font color="yellow">I'm the big brother here!</font>

- In Rang, I'm completely broke.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hey, Seo Yeon.</font>

202
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,313
<font color="yellow">I didn't see you in class today.</font>

203
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,770
<font color="yellow">I just had some
business to take care of.</font>

204
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:18,908
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

205
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:22,786
<font color="yellow">We recieved some materials to take
home from class today. Just a moment.</font>

206
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,356
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Professor.
- Hello.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Joo Hye Sung]</i>
This belongs to Professor Joo.</font>

211
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,554
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Are you going to eat lunch?</font>

212
00:17:30,554 --> 00:17:33,403
<font color="yellow">Do you only ever think about eating?</font>

213
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,098
<font color="yellow">- What is this?
- What do you think it is?</font>

214
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,350
<font color="yellow">You want me to tutor you.</font>

215
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,943
<font color="yellow">I need to know what your skill
level is so I can plan accordingly.</font>

216
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:46,523
<font color="yellow">Okay, you have one hour.</font>

217
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,875
<font color="yellow">Right now?
I have a bit of a headache today.</font>

218
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,741
<font color="yellow">Have you no intention of crossing over?</font>

219
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:55,962
<font color="yellow">You said you need to take
the SAT in order to cross over.</font>

220
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:58,145
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but not now.</font>

221
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,504
<font color="yellow">You have one hour.</font>

222

- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</font>

<font color="yellow">Number two!</font>

225
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,910
<font color="yellow">Just skip it if you don't know.</font>

226
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,391
<font color="yellow">I'm going to solve all of it!</font>

227
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,369
<font color="yellow">Hey... what's the minimum SAT
score for you to cross over?</font>

228
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,702
<font color="yellow">I would need a good
enough score to come here</font>

229
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:53,895
<font color="yellow">in order for me to cross over to
the afterlife without any problems.</font>

230
00:18:54,666 --> 00:19:00,436
<font color="yellow">Looks like you don't have
a chance of crossing over this year.</font>

231
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:01,436
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

232
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:07,620
<font color="yellow">- 32 percent?
- Yes, 32 percent.</font>

233
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:13,825
<font color="yellow">At this rate, you won't even get
near the gates to the afterlife.</font>

234
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,724
<font color="yellow">How do you expect to take
the SAT with these scores?</font>

235
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:17,607
<font color="yellow">It's my first exam in five years!</font>

236
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:21,465
<font color="yellow">Five years or 10 years.
This exam is not that hard.</font>

237
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:22,674
<font color="yellow">A junior high kid would
do better than you.</font>

238
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:25,547
<font color="yellow">So what? Are you bragging about
how smart you are right now?</font>

239
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,366
<font color="yellow">I'm done!</font>

240
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,273
<font color="yellow">You're the one who failed. How
dare you take your anger out on me.</font>

241
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:37,443
<font color="yellow">It's not like that! I didn't sleep well
yesterday, so I'm not feeling that good.</font>

242
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:41,769
<font color="yellow">- Then take it again.
- What?</font>

243
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:46,077
<font color="yellow">Take what again? I'm very busy, okay?</font>

244
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,809
<font color="yellow">Professor.</font>

245
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:58,115
<font color="yellow">Oh, Miss Seo Yeon.
What brings you here?</font>

246
00:19:58,116 --> 00:20:03,889
<font color="yellow">I have something to give you.
Here. I think this belongs to you.</font>

247
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:08,081
<font color="yellow">Ah, you're right.</font>

248
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,020
<font color="yellow">Thank you, but how do you have this?</font>

249
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,500
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.
A student in our class picked it up.</font>

250
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,247
<font color="yellow">- Who?
- Her name is No Hyun Joo.</font>

251
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:21,802
<font color="yellow">Ah, No Hyun Joo.
The student who missed class today?</font>

252
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:23,177
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I see.</font>

253
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,488
<font color="yellow">Anyway, this is great.
I was looking for it. Thank you.</font>

254
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:29,860
<font color="yellow">Not at all. You must be
busy, so I'll be on my way.</font>

255
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,870
<font color="yellow">Sure. By the way, is the dog okay?</font>

256
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:35,355
<font color="yellow">Yes, thanks to you.</font>

257
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:38,549
<font color="yellow">- Call me anytime if you need anything.
- Yes, thank you.</font>

258
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,595
<font color="yellow">Okay, take care.</font>

259
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:19,952
<font color="yellow">Take it easy, you quack.</font>

260
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:23,102
<font color="yellow">How can you make a living when
you do it so painfully like this?</font>

261
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:27,151
<font color="yellow">I'm better than you, punk.
Give me your hand.</font>

262
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,524
<font color="yellow">Ouch, be gentle!</font>

263
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:38,570
<font color="yellow">Goodness, your pulse is so weak.
I can barely feel it.</font>

264
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,395
<font color="yellow">- You're hopeless.
- Your skills are hopeless, punk.</font>

265
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,536
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

266
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:48,835
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised you're still
alive after all those encounters.</font>

267
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:52,817
<font color="yellow">Does Bong Pal know that
you're in this state because of him?</font>

268
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:54,829
<font color="yellow">What for? It's not nice to talk about.</font>

269
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,047
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare talk
about this to Bong Pal.</font>

270
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:59,362
<font color="yellow">And stop saying I'm in bad
condition. I'm totally fine.</font>

271
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:03,137
<font color="yellow">Outwardly you look fine,
but you're a complete mess inside.</font>

272
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:06,482
<font color="yellow">Make sure you take it
easy for the time being.</font>

273
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,865
<font color="yellow">Have you been to that place
where Bong Pal's father resides?</font>

274
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,924
<font color="yellow">- I hear he left a long time ago.
- Goodness.</font>

275
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:17,568
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if he told me
where he's going ahead of time.</font>

276
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:23,302
<font color="yellow">That man is chasing that punk, isn't he?</font>

277
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:25,567
<font color="yellow">The evil spirit that killed his wife.</font>

278
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:28,152
<font color="yellow">It seems that way.</font>

279
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,818
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's been over 10 years.</font>

280
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:35,410
<font color="yellow">There wasn't anything special in
his room except for that picture.</font>

281
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:38,397
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why was he in such a hurry?</font>

282
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:43,235
<font color="yellow">He even forgot to send
the letter he wrote to his son.</font>

283
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:50,264
<font color="yellow">And I hear someone else came
looking for him besides me.</font>

284
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,201
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

285
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:56,501
<font color="yellow">The owner couldn't get
a good look at his face.</font>

286
00:22:56,502 --> 00:23:01,286
<font color="yellow">She said he was just
a young and handsome fellow.</font>

287
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:03,245
<font color="yellow">- A young and handsome fellow?
- Yes.</font>

288
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,654
<font color="yellow">Ouch! Hey!</font>

289
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:15,937
<font color="yellow">- I don't think I can accept this.
- What?</font>

290
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,700
<font color="yellow">Why not? I bought this two months ago</font>

291
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:23,279
<font color="yellow">and there's still
two years left of the AS period.</font>

292
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,199
<font color="yellow">It looks like you forced it on here.</font>

293
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,475
<font color="yellow">The AS is difficult if you
personally install it like this.</font>

294
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,634
<font color="yellow">It's better to buy
a new one than fix it.</font>

295
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:37,550
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think so.
We never touched it...</font>

296
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,113
<font color="yellow">It was you, wasn't it?</font>

297
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:57,422
<font color="yellow">You're the one who
messed around with it.</font>

298
00:23:57,423 --> 00:24:00,619
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you not to touch it and
that we won't get the AS if it breaks?</font>

299
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:03,615
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it.</font>

300
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:06,924
<font color="yellow">You know how I bought this, don't you?</font>

301
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,441
<font color="yellow">I do. I know you bought it
with your room and board money.</font>

302
00:24:09,442 --> 00:24:13,072
<font color="yellow">Right. I still have 10 months of
payments left and I lied to my family.</font>

303
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:14,860
<font color="yellow">- You did.
- And?</font>

304
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:22,451
<font color="yellow">Well, I didn't... I didn't do it.
It was these guys. They did it.</font>

305
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,424
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's wrong? No! No! No!</font>

306
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,137
<font color="yellow">No! No, don't do it...</font>

307
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:42,481
<font color="yellow">He scares the crap out of
me whenever he's like that.</font>

308
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,981
<font color="yellow">Damn it. Hey, In Rang!</font>

309
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:47,603
<font color="yellow">In Rang! Shoo! Shoo!</font>

310
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:51,252
<font color="yellow">- Lunch is on me.
- Go away!</font>

311
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:05,285
<font color="yellow">In Rang, don't be angry anymore.</font>

312
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:09,489
<font color="yellow">Should we order a bottle of soju?</font>

313
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,594
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about it!
Soju, my butt.</font>

314
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,869
<font color="yellow">We're broke
and we have no money for soju.</font>

315
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:27,343
<font color="yellow">Take out everything you have.</font>

316
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:44,076
<font color="yellow">You wanted to buy soju with this?</font>

317
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:47,906
<font color="yellow">There's barely enough there to pay for
our meals and you wanted to buy soju?</font>

318
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:55,645
<font color="yellow">Where are we going to sleep?</font>

319
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,258
<font color="yellow">- What about you?
- I'm going home.</font>

320
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,077
<font color="yellow">- Then what about me?
- You can come with me.</font>

321
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:02,208
<font color="yellow">Your grandmother hates me.</font>

322
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,729
<font color="yellow">No, she despises me.</font>

323
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,277
<font color="yellow">In Rang, why are you in such a hurry?</font>

324
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:14,550
<font color="yellow">I'm in a hurry because we
have to find a place to sleep.</font>

325
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:18,405
<font color="yellow">Are you abandoning me?</font>

326
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:22,395
<font color="yellow">Wait for me!</font>

327
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:39,370
<font color="yellow">I have to read all of this?</font>

328
00:26:39,372 --> 00:26:42,588
<font color="yellow">You have to read all of this
and more. This is just the beginning.</font>

329
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,321
<font color="yellow">There's so much you have to study for.</font>

330
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:46,962
<font color="yellow">Okay, what do you want to do first?</font>

331
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,656
<font color="yellow">Math first.</font>

332
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,197
<font color="yellow">Not this one.</font>

333
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,016
<font color="yellow">How about we start with Korean first?</font>

334
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:00,524
<font color="yellow">- Let's start with math first.
- Why ask then?</font>

335
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:03,235
<font color="yellow">I can hear you. Sit up straight.</font>

336
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:05,551
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

337
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:09,946
<font color="yellow">Let's see here.</font>

338
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,584
<font color="yellow">My stomach is killing me all of a sudden.
I need to go to the bathroom.</font>

339
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:21,348
<font color="yellow">Ghosts don't need to go to the bathroom.</font>

340
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:27,291
<font color="yellow">Ah, my head hurts so much. Hold on.</font>

341
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,538
<font color="yellow">Stop stalling.
You're the one who wanted to study.</font>

342
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,155
<font color="yellow">- Let's do it properly.
- Okay.</font>

343
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:42,733
<font color="yellow">This is easy enough.
Go ahead and solve it.</font>

344
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:50,866
<font color="yellow">So, if the limit is A to B for
this equation, then GX equals B.</font>

345
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,595
<font color="yellow">Then GX...</font>

346
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:58,868
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping?</font>

347
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,299
<font color="yellow">She didn't solve a single problem.</font>

348
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,185
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Hyun Ji. Hey. Whoa.</font>

349
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:47,324
<font color="yellow">Let's just pick a random place.
How far are we going to walk?</font>

350
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:52,186
<font color="yellow">This place is willing to give us
50 percent off. We have no choice!</font>

351
00:28:52,187 --> 00:28:54,152
<font color="yellow">We're almost there.</font>

352
00:28:57,493 --> 00:29:00,507
<font color="yellow">It's over there! Over there, over there!</font>

353
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:02,710
<font color="yellow">That's the place.</font>

354
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:05,858
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

355
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:08,664
<font color="yellow">Goodness, why do you
have so much baggage?</font>

356
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:12,177
<font color="yellow">I'll keep it in storage
without charging extra.</font>

357
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,360
<font color="yellow">- Just rest comfortably.
- Thank you!</font>

358
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,857
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much!</font>

359
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:20,644
<font color="yellow">Sure, let me take that.
Oh my goodness.</font>

360
00:29:21,418 --> 00:29:22,951
<font color="yellow">- This too.
- This as well?</font>

361
00:29:22,952 --> 00:29:23,952
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

362
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:26,605
<font color="yellow">- Please rest up.
- Thank you.</font>

363
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:31,105
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

364
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:34,524
<font color="yellow">The owner is friendly
and the place is very nice.</font>

365
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,622
<font color="yellow">But why is there no one here?</font>

366
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,389
<font color="yellow">That's good for us.</font>

367
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,174
<font color="yellow">It's all ours.</font>

368
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:44,666
<font color="yellow">- Let's go break a sweat!
- Sounds good.</font>

369
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:48,183
<font color="yellow">Sounds good, sounds good, sounds good.</font>

370
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:55,010
<font color="yellow">I'm melting. I'm melting.</font>

371
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:57,599
<font color="yellow">Hot, hot, it's very hot.</font>

372
00:29:58,418 --> 00:30:01,744
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang, how long
are we going to stay here?</font>

373
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:05,951
<font color="yellow">Well, it's about tomorrow, isn't it?</font>

374
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:08,201
<font color="yellow">Think about it tomorrow.</font>

375
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:09,510
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

376
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,681
<font color="yellow">- Let's sleep.
- Let's do that.</font>

377
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:16,651
<font color="yellow">Let's think about it tomorrow.</font>

378
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,221
<font color="yellow">I wasn't expecting a text from anybody.</font>

379
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,458
<font color="yellow"><i>Seniors, if this is how you handle
things, we may have a problem. </i></font>

380
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,530
<font color="yellow">- It's from Bong Pal.
- Of course it's from him.</font>

381
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,931
<font color="yellow">What did he say?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

382
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:32,961
<font color="yellow">- He is asking for money.
- Wow, he won't give up, will he?</font>

383
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,881
<font color="yellow">He's consistent, seriously.</font>

384
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:37,860
<font color="yellow">- What should we do?
- Give it to me.</font>

385
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,780
<font color="yellow">- I don't know. Let's sleep.
- I mean...</font>

386
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,280
<font color="yellow">Then I will sleep too.
I don't know either.</font>

387
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:21,131
<font color="yellow">In Rang...</font>

388
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,451
<font color="yellow"><i>[Please close the door tightly]</i></font>

389
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,501
<font color="yellow">In Rang!</font>

390
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:51,110
<font color="yellow">What is it? What?</font>

391
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,721
<font color="yellow">Is this locked?</font>

392
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:58,991
<font color="yellow">It's now open.
What was that about?</font>

393
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,413
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

394
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,350
<font color="yellow">- Are you up?
- Yes.</font>

395
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,068
<font color="yellow">By the way, why was I sleeping here?</font>

396
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:18,431
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
You fell asleep there.</font>

397
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:20,431
<font color="yellow">Did I do that?</font>

398
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:24,046
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why didn't you wake me up?</font>

399
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:25,941
<font color="yellow">I tried, but you wouldn't wake up.</font>

400
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:28,171
<font color="yellow">Then you should've moved
me to the sofa at least.</font>

401
00:32:28,171 --> 00:32:29,411
<font color="yellow">How could you let
a woman sleep like this?</font>

402
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:30,901
<font color="yellow">You're very heavy.</font>

403
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:33,560
<font color="yellow">I won't throw my back out
because of you.</font>

404
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

405
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:40,550
<font color="yellow">Gosh! He's such a jerk!</font>

406
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,270
<font color="yellow">Wait, it's open.</font>

407
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:51,580
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal told me not to go in...</font>

408
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,391
<font color="yellow">Wow, why is there so much stuff in here?</font>

409
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,290
<font color="yellow">Hong Myung Hee?
Who could that be?</font>

410
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:32,821
<font color="yellow">Wow, these shoes may fit me perfectly.</font>

411
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:40,211
<font color="yellow">- Hey, what are you doing in here?
- Bong Pal.</font>

412
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:43,031
<font color="yellow">Whose shoes are these?
Can you burn them for me?</font>

413
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:51,910
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come in here.</font>

414
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,060
<font color="yellow">Who said you could
touch the stuff in here?</font>

415
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,350
<font color="yellow">- Well, I was just...
- You!</font>

416
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,770
<font color="yellow">You're a ghost.</font>

417
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,571
<font color="yellow">So stop acting like a human.</font>

418
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,321
<font color="yellow">Why is he all mad like that?</font>

419
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,810
<font color="yellow">What did I do that was so wrong?</font>

420
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:53,131
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness...</font>

421
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,790
<font color="yellow">Here. Are you okay?</font>

422
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,551
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I keep seeing ghosts.</font>

423
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:03,881
<font color="yellow">Is that because I'm cursed this year?</font>

424
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:08,381
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang, take a look at this.</font>

425
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:11,290
<font color="yellow">There was a reason
why that place was cheap.</font>

426
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:15,511
<font color="yellow">This man died in there a month ago.</font>

427
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:19,850
<font color="yellow">That place was known
to be haunted.</font>

428
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,981
<font color="yellow">- You took me to such a place, huh?
- I didn't know that.</font>

429
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,571
<font color="yellow">Anyway, they performed a very
expensive exorcism there and all.</font>

430
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,740
<font color="yellow">Gosh, even if you perform an exorcism,
ghosts will still come.</font>

431
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,700
<font color="yellow">They wasted the money.
They should've just given it to us.</font>

432
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,073
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

433
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:39,080
<font color="yellow">Let's find
an empty classroom to sleep in.</font>

434
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,350
<font color="yellow">- Are you that sleepy?
- Yes.</font>

435
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,381
<font color="yellow"><i>Your call is being redirected...</i></font>

436
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,551
<font color="yellow">Gosh, the phone is still switched off?</font>

437
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:50,361
<font color="yellow">Seriously, guys...</font>

438
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,870
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- It's Bong Pal.</font>

439
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,600
<font color="yellow">Seniors!</font>

440
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:04,370
<font color="yellow">Senior In Rang!</font>

441
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,600
<font color="yellow">It's not that we're trying
not to pay you.</font>

442
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,361
<font color="yellow">- It may take a little bit of time.
- For how long?</font>

443
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,220
<font color="yellow">- Two months.
- Two days.</font>

444
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,111
<font color="yellow">That's right, two days.</font>

445
00:36:31,211 --> 00:36:34,261
<font color="yellow">How are we supposed to come up
with money like that in two days?</font>

446
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,901
<font color="yellow">We can pay you back in two days.</font>

447
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,700
<font color="yellow">- How?
- It's a secret.</font>

448
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,057
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

449
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:47,921
<font color="yellow">I'm saying it's a secret.</font>

450
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:21,310
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she might not have had lunch yet.</font>

451
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm hungry.</font>

452
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,481
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal must be having lunch by now.</font>

453
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,700
<font color="yellow">Should I go over to the school?</font>

454
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,450
<font color="yellow"><i>You are a ghost.</i></font>

455
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:45,361
<font color="yellow">So stop acting like a human.</font>

456
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,330
<font color="yellow">I already know that I'm a ghost.</font>

457
00:37:58,001 --> 00:37:59,087
<font color="yellow"><i>[Bul Ga Ma Sauna]</i></font>

458
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:14,950
<font color="yellow">Did we really have to dress up like this?</font>

459
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,910
<font color="yellow">If we're going to do it,
we should do it right.</font>

460
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,850
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

461
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:29,178
<font color="yellow"><i>[Temporarily closed]</i></font>

462
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:32,571
<font color="yellow">Are you having a hard time
because of a ghost?</font>

463
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:36,281
<font color="yellow">Even if there was an exorcism,
it wasn't helpful?</font>

464
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:42,901
<font color="yellow">We will... take care of your problem.</font>

465
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,631
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's Bong Pal.</font>

466
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:21,040
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you turn the light on?
Why are you sitting in the dark?</font>

467
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,810
<font color="yellow">So what if it's dark?</font>

468
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,350
<font color="yellow">I'm just a ghost, not a human.</font>

469
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,151
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you hungry?
- So what?</font>

470
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:30,390
<font color="yellow">Will I starve to death
when I'm only a ghost?</font>

471
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,790
<font color="yellow">Why does this pork belly look so good?</font>

472
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:50,461
<font color="yellow">Should I make bulgogi with this meat?</font>

473
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:52,180
<font color="yellow">It will be so good...</font>

474
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,151
<font color="yellow">Wow, I'm full.</font>

475
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,240
<font color="yellow">I will do the dishes tomorrow.</font>

476
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:22,120
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

477
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,551
<font color="yellow">Take a look at this. Gosh.</font>

478
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:27,251
<font color="yellow">The sale volume is definitely low
compared to his previous clinic.</font>

479
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,051
<font color="yellow">Wasn't his clinic in the Gangnam area?</font>

480
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:31,640
<font color="yellow">That's correct.</font>

481
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,481
<font color="yellow">We were very busy then.</font>

482
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:34,716
<font color="yellow">It's like a paradise here.</font>

483
00:41:34,716 --> 00:41:36,861
<font color="yellow">Then why did he start
this clinic all of a sudden?</font>

484
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,861
<font color="yellow">It isn't doing well in this area.</font>

485
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:42,901
<font color="yellow">I agree. He sold the clinic
all of a sudden and came here.</font>

486
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,200
<font color="yellow">He suddenly accepted the offer
to become a professor.</font>

487
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,211
<font color="yellow">Either way, he's so cool,
so I like it here.</font>

488
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:52,761
<font color="yellow">Come on. Hurry up.</font>

489
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:57,370
<font color="yellow">- Good work, ladies.
- Are you going somewhere, sir?</font>

490
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,660
<font color="yellow">Yes, I need to go.</font>

491
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,870
<font color="yellow">Wrap things up and go home.</font>

492
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,671
<font color="yellow">- We will. Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.</font>

493
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:05,301
<font color="yellow">I will go first.</font>

494
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,211
<font color="yellow">Hello? Now?</font>

495
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,861
<font color="yellow">Yum, I enjoyed the meal.</font>

496
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:39,290
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm full.</font>

497
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:42,901
<font color="yellow">- I'm off.
- Are you?</font>

498
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:44,861
<font color="yellow">- To where?
- To meet my seniors.</font>

499
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:46,520
<font color="yellow">Your seniors?</font>

500
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:50,290
<font color="yellow">- Ah, they will pay you?
- Yes.</font>

501
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,981
<font color="yellow">- Shall I come with you?
- Whatever.</font>

502
00:42:56,841 --> 00:43:00,950
<font color="yellow">Shall we have something to drink
first before we begin?</font>

503
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,611
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

504
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:19,341
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, drink.</font>

505
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:21,461
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

506
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,861
<font color="yellow">You're not going to pay me in cash.</font>

507
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:25,171
<font color="yellow">If I destroy the ghost there...</font>

508
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:28,830
<font color="yellow">You will take 1.5 million
from the reward money.</font>

509
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:33,071
<font color="yellow">It's like a win-win situation.</font>

510
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:36,501
<font color="yellow">Three million!</font>

511
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,051
<font color="yellow">Stay seated first. Have a seat.</font>

512
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:46,310
<font color="yellow">Come with me quickly. Come with me.</font>

513
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:49,461
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

514
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,321
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to taste it.</font>

515
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:54,560
<font color="yellow">- I've been curious about the taste.
- Put it down, will you?</font>

516
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:58,600
<font color="yellow">You can't drink alcohol
when you're not old enough.</font>

517
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

518
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,020
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

519
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,850
<font color="yellow">We were promised
four million for the job.</font>

520
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,490
<font color="yellow">If we give him three, we lose money.</font>

521
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,211
<font color="yellow">Plus, the expenses
to fix the room and camera.</font>

522
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:16,850
<font color="yellow">Then what are you going to tell
the owner of the sauna, huh?</font>

523
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,850
<font color="yellow">Will you catch the ghost yourself?</font>

524
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:20,600
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to die?</font>

525
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,100
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to get ripped to pieces?</font>

526
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,520
<font color="yellow">That's what I was saying...</font>

527
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,600
<font color="yellow">So three?</font>

528
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:29,441
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

529
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:36,131
<font color="yellow">Wow, woo-hoo!</font>

530
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,600
<font color="yellow">So let's make a deal of three million.</font>

531
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,091
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

532
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:52,711
<font color="yellow">Let's go with 3.5 million.</font>

533
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:55,691
<font color="yellow">- We'll suffer a big loss.
- I agree.</font>

534
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:56,751
<font color="yellow">Done.</font>

535
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,540
<font color="yellow">What exactly is the job?</font>

536
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,551
<font color="yellow">So the job is...</font>

537
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,591
<font color="yellow"><i>[Sauna]</i></font>

538
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,350
<font color="yellow">You said you'd work tomorrow.</font>

539
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:33,040
<font color="yellow">Today we're doing a spot inspection only.</font>

540
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,111
<font color="yellow">We want to be prepared
for tomorrow and all...</font>

541
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:38,841
<font color="yellow">Then is he the exorcist?</font>

542
00:45:38,841 --> 00:45:41,961
<font color="yellow">He's not old enough
and just look at the way he's dressed.</font>

543
00:45:41,961 --> 00:45:43,961
<font color="yellow">Are you a student?</font>

544
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:48,310
<font color="yellow">He's not the exorcist.</font>

545
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,531
<font color="yellow">He's our cute office assistant.</font>

546
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:56,051
<font color="yellow">He wanted to see
how our jobs are done.</font>

547
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:59,031
<font color="yellow">So we brought him with us today.</font>

548
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:01,131
<font color="yellow">- Didn't we, Pal?
- Sure.</font>

549
00:46:01,131 --> 00:46:04,020
<font color="yellow">Then look around and give me a call.</font>

550
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,020
<font color="yellow">- Please take care of it.
- We will, sir.</font>

551
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,240
<font color="yellow">Trust us and let us handle it.</font>

552
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,051
<font color="yellow">Should we have him
fitted for a tuxedo too?</font>

553
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,700
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter how he dresses.</font>

554
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,240
<font color="yellow">It's good as long as he
can catch ghosts, right?</font>

555
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,990
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

556
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:53,461
<font color="yellow">- He's not in there?
- No, he isn't.</font>

557
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,330
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

558
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,131
<font color="yellow">- I'm here.
- Me too.</font>

559
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:01,091
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

560
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:23,790
<font color="yellow">Did someone die in here?</font>

561
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,611
<font color="yellow">He was a man in his fifties.</font>

562
00:47:25,611 --> 00:47:29,270
<font color="yellow">According to the owner,
he was a regular.</font>

563
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:32,191
<font color="yellow">He might have been a lowlife scumbag.</font>

564
00:47:32,611 --> 00:47:38,151
<font color="yellow">You know, those who try to
grab women and such.</font>

565
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,461
<font color="yellow">They try to touch... you know, a pervert.</font>

566
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,691
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

567
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,441
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you going?</font>

568
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:17,970
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.</font>

569
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,970
<font color="yellow">There is a ghost.</font>

570
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,910
<font color="yellow">That bastard...</font>

571
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:50,520
<font color="yellow">- He's strong.
- Bong Pal!</font>

572
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,961
<font color="yellow">Why is he circling around?</font>

573
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,365
<font color="yellow">His chest!</font>

574
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,060
<font color="yellow">Attack his chest!</font>

575
00:50:38,921 --> 00:50:41,481
<font color="yellow">What took you so long?</font>

576
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,970
<font color="yellow">Is it over?</font>

577
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,950
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

578
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,571
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

579
00:50:58,571 --> 00:51:00,950
<font color="yellow">Can you hear me?</font>

580
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:05,890
<font color="yellow">Cheer up, baby. Cheer up, baby.</font>

581
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,671
<font color="yellow">Cheer up a bit.</font>

582
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,251
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, watch this, okay?</font>

583
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:15,921
<font color="yellow">Cheer up, baby. Cheer up a bit.</font>

584
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:18,341
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, watch this, okay?</font>

585
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,251
<font color="yellow">It's rare to see a drunken ghost.</font>

586
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:30,671
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Hyun Ji.</font>

587
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,841
<font color="yellow">You're drunk.</font>

588
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:34,921
<font color="yellow">I'm not drunk.</font>

589
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:37,531
<font color="yellow">See? I'm perfectly fine.</font>

590
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:39,810
<font color="yellow">My Bong Pal...</font>

591
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,910
<font color="yellow">Why are you so ugly, huh?</font>

592
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,131
<font color="yellow">You're so ugly.</font>

593
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,790
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you're not drunk?
You can't even stand straight.</font>

594
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:53,540
<font color="yellow">What? Who can't? Me?</font>

595
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,511
<font color="yellow">No way. I can walk just fine like this.</font>

596
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,540
<font color="yellow">Watch me, okay? Watch me.</font>

597
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,990
<font color="yellow">I can walk from here to there.</font>

598
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,350
<font color="yellow">I walk just fine, right?</font>

599
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,990
<font color="yellow">I can go places even better now.</font>

600
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,950
<font color="yellow">Watch me. See?</font>

601
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,290
<font color="yellow">Ouch. It hurts.</font>

602
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:25,111
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

603
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,821
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get up.</font>

604
00:52:30,821 --> 00:52:33,711
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, I'm hurt.</font>

605
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,490
<font color="yellow">- Get up so we can go home.
- I'm not going.</font>

606
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,890
<font color="yellow">I'm not going home.</font>

607
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,761
<font color="yellow">Fine then. Stay here all night.</font>

608
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,600
<font color="yellow">Fine, you bastard.</font>

609
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,421
<font color="yellow">I will live here from now on.</font>

610
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:50,151
<font color="yellow">I will spend the night here.</font>

611
00:52:50,151 --> 00:52:53,131
<font color="yellow">Hey, you...</font>

612
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:57,611
<font color="yellow">You can't do this to me.</font>

613
00:52:57,611 --> 00:53:00,611
<font color="yellow">Come here so I can hit you.</font>

614
00:53:05,071 --> 00:53:07,401
<font color="yellow">You ducked?</font>

615
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,910
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare move.</font>

616
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,520
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?
You sure are doing a lot of things.</font>

617
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,080
<font color="yellow">What kind of ghost is an obnoxious drunk?</font>

618
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:24,111
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

619
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:27,761
<font color="yellow">A ghost shouldn't even
be an obnoxious drunk?</font>

620
00:53:27,761 --> 00:53:31,080
<font color="yellow">A ghost shouldn't want to
put on pretty clothes either?</font>

621
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,861
<font color="yellow">A ghost shouldn't do things like a human?</font>

622
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:44,950
<font color="yellow">When I'm only a ghost.</font>

623
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,520
<font color="yellow">When I'm only a ghost...</font>

624
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:57,731
<font color="yellow">Don't say that anymore.</font>

625
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,120
<font color="yellow">Did I die because I wanted to?</font>

626
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,220
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I died.</font>

627
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,461
<font color="yellow">I don't even know how I died.</font>

628
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:27,031
<font color="yellow">I don't like being a ghost.</font>

629
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,461
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be a ghost.</font>

630
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:38,990
<font color="yellow">I didn't become one because I wanted to.</font>

631
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,611
<font color="yellow">Ghost can have their feelings hurt, okay?</font>

632
00:54:47,031 --> 00:54:49,111
<font color="yellow">You're a bastard.</font>

633
00:55:09,531 --> 00:55:12,281
<font color="yellow">I don't even know what I'm doing.</font>

634
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:15,151

- Hey.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

636
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,651
<font color="yellow">Oh my, you're so pretty.</font>

637
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:28,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why is a ghost so heavy?</font>

638
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:32,281
<font color="yellow">What? How can I be heavy?</font>

639
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:35,970
<font color="yellow">I'm so light. I must be light.</font>

640
00:55:36,011 --> 00:55:39,231
<font color="yellow">I'm as light as a feather.</font>

641
00:55:39,231 --> 00:55:41,520
<font color="yellow">Let's go now.</font>

642
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:57,020
<font color="yellow">No Hyun Joo.</font>

643
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:01,981
<font color="yellow">Who's there?</font>

644
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,600
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo.</font>

645
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,790
<font color="yellow">You're getting home late.</font>

646
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,401
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

647
00:56:22,361 --> 00:56:26,651
<font color="yellow">I have something to ask.</font>

648
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,560
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

649
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,341
<font color="yellow">Where did you find this?</font>

650
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:03,830
<font color="yellow">Wow, this neighborhood is very quiet.</font>

651
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,071
