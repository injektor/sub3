Still, this would mean that you have<br>agreed to work together as a team...

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:38.125
I'm going to go.

00:15:40.992 --> 00:15:42.542
He's leaving.

What is it?

00:16:15.239 --> 00:16:17.143
It's nothing.

00:16:18.461 --> 00:16:22.047
By the way, have you decided who you're<br>going to work with on the final exam?

00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:23.556
It's a group project.

00:16:23.557 --> 00:16:24.904
No.

00:16:24.906 --> 00:16:27.215
Do you want to do it with me?

00:16:28.203 --> 00:16:31.731
My Bong Pal can do it all by himself!

00:16:31.732 --> 00:16:34.368

What?

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:50.343

Shall I let you all go early today?

00:17:31.203 --> 00:17:33.098
Yes!

00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:37.759
I'll think about it if<br>you pay attention in class.

Do you want to eat together today?

00:18:25.413 --> 00:18:27.999
Since you're helping me with class, I'll<br>buy something good to eat. Is that okay?

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.656
Yes, it's fine with me.<br>What about you?

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.138
It's fine with me too.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.898
I live near the school.

00:19:44.899 --> 00:19:48.580
What a relief. I felt bad for making you<br>come out early to prepare for my class.

00:19:49.609 --> 00:19:51.868
You must be living by yourself<br>if you live near the school.

00:19:51.869 --> 00:19:53.964
Yes.

00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:57.579
Then where do your parents live?

00:19:58.962 --> 00:20:01.149
Ah, they live somewhere else.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.287
They must live far away.<br>Do you see them often?

Have you talked to your father recently?

00:20:15.364 --> 00:20:17.281
Why do you ask that?

00:20:18.253 --> 00:20:20.047
It's nothing.

By the way, are the preparations<br>for your final exams going well?

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:26.031
Yes, we're going to start soon.

Just thinking about it makes me angry!

00:20:52.625 --> 00:20:54.747
Right, right, right?<br>It's worth being angry over, right?

00:20:54.749 --> 00:20:56.419
Absolutely!<br>How could he take the chair out?

00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:57.789
I know!

00:20:58.502 --> 00:21:01.902

00:21:01.903 --> 00:21:03.839
What a jerk!

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:08.313
- Huh?<br>- He's always scolding and nagging me.

00:21:08.314 --> 00:21:11.833
But he's always smiling and laughing<br>like an idiot in front of that girl.

00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:16.215
Are you talking about<br>that blood sausage?

00:21:16.216 --> 00:21:20.870
Yes. He's probably laughing<br>and eating with that girl right now.

00:21:21.524 --> 00:21:22.837
I see.

Yeah, it was good.

00:22:34.525 --> 00:22:37.102
I'm sure it was since<br>you ate with that girl.

You know, it seems like<br>Seo Yeon likes that professor.

00:22:41.655 --> 00:22:45.475
I don't blame her. He's good-looking<br>and he has a nice personality.
