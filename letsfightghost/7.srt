33
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,310
<font color="yellow">I wonder if it's because
you fell in the water.</font>

34

to do when a ghost gets sick?</font>

take her to the hospital.</font>

You didn't even eat breakfast.</font>

54

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,930

<font color="yellow">Let's put it right in here.</font>

57

<font color="yellow">How long are you going to
play that? Stop it already.</font>

58

<font color="yellow">This is amazing.</font>

59
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,230
<font color="yellow">- Where did you get that?
- This? I borrowed it from a friend...</font>

60
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,780
<font color="yellow">Where did you get a friend?
You don't have friends.</font>

61
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,930
<font color="yellow">I do... not have friends.</font>

62
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,760
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't poke at
someone's pain like that.</font>

63
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,990
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

64
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,260
<font color="yellow">This... I mean, this...</font>

65
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,770
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this? You probably
wasted all your allowance on it.</font>

66
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,030
<font color="yellow">It's actually not as
expensive as it looks.</font>

67
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,480
<font color="yellow">It's not...</font>

68
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,240
<font color="yellow">Whether this is expensive
or not is not important!</font>

69
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,620
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?
Just what is wrong with you? Huh?</font>

70
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,060
<font color="yellow">Look! Look! Look, look, look!</font>

71
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,300
<font color="yellow">The retreat fees, gas money... there's so
many bills we have to take care of!</font>

72
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,330
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to spend quite a bit
of money when you start a business.</font>

73
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,040
<font color="yellow">This may not seem very important,
but our club members might...</font>

74
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,070
<font color="yellow">It's necessary to help
our members organize.</font>

75
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,690
<font color="yellow">But we're spending
more than we're earning.</font>

76
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,350
<font color="yellow">That's why I have
an investment plan lined up.</font>

77
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,600
<font color="yellow">An investment plan?</font>

78
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,040
<font color="yellow">This measly amount of money?
We can take care of this in one blow.</font>

79
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,770
<font color="yellow">Don't... Don't worry!
What should we do?</font>

80
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,370
<font color="yellow">You want to go meet that investor? Huh?</font>

81
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,140
<font color="yellow">An investor?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[SHAMAN]</i></font>

83
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,290

84
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,170
<font color="yellow"><i>What's taking you so long?
Where are you?</i></font>

85
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, did we make plans?
Sorry, I've been out of it today.</font>

86
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,050
<font color="yellow">I can't go today. I'm going
somewhere and I'm on my way there.</font>

87
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,910
<font color="yellow">- <i>Where?</i>
- The place Bong Pal's father is staying.</font>

88
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,130
<font color="yellow">I need to see him with my own eyes.
I have a bad feeling about this.</font>

89
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,560
<font color="yellow">It's okay, I'm perfectly fine! Hang up!</font>

90
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,020
<font color="yellow">Just where is my honey?</font>

91
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, Honey! I finally found you!
Honey! Honey!</font>

92
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,470
<font color="yellow">- Are you awake?
- Yes.</font>

93
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,540
<font color="yellow">Why am I here?</font>

94
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,790
<font color="yellow">I moved you in here.</font>

95
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,870
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry.
Lie down while I heat up the porridge.</font>

96
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,820
<font color="yellow">I told you to lie down.
Why did you come out?</font>

97
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,100
<font color="yellow">I'm totally fine now.
I think I was just tired.</font>

98
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,090
<font color="yellow">Really? That's a relief.
Go ahead and eat.</font>

99
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,870
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Bong Pal.</font>

100
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,470
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

101
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,930
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you go to school?</font>

102
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,290
<font color="yellow">Ah, I was kind of tired too.</font>

103
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,850
<font color="yellow">But do ghosts get sick too?</font>

104
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,730
<font color="yellow">- Yeah, our hearts race too.
- What?</font>

105
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

106
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,750
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

107
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,760
<font color="yellow">By the way, some of my memories
returned while I was sleeping.</font>

108
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,740
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? What popped up?</font>

109
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,030
<font color="yellow">I was lying down and someone
was looking down at me.</font>

110
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,590
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

111
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,150
<font color="yellow">Well, I couldn't see their face.</font>

112
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,840
<font color="yellow">Oh right, and some lady was crying.</font>

113
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,380
<font color="yellow">I wonder who it was?</font>

114
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,660
<font color="yellow">She was crying with such sorrow.</font>

115
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,850
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

116
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,430
<font color="yellow">Goodness, what is this?</font>

117
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,130
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many
people looking for that man?</font>

118
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,840
<font color="yellow">I mean, the acupuncturist
came last time.</font>

119
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,060
<font color="yellow">What's going on today?</font>

120
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,250
<font color="yellow">It's nothing really.</font>

121
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,970
<font color="yellow">I came to ask some questions.</font>

122
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,050
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

123
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,650
<font color="yellow">I heard a young person came looking
for the man who lives in that room.</font>

124
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, he came.</font>

125
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,700
<font color="yellow"><i>My eyes are bad, so I didn't
get a good look at his face.</i></font>

126
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,260
<font color="yellow">Oh, his son?
He's over there.</font>

127
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,090
<font color="yellow"><i>He was a good-looking young man.</i></font>

128
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,680
<font color="yellow">His son?</font>

129
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,640
<font color="yellow">I assumed he was his son.</font>

130
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,280
<font color="yellow">Your son is here to see you.</font>

131
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,140
<font color="yellow"><i>His face just got serious
when I told him his son came.</i></font>

132
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,490
<font color="yellow"><i>He just ran into the back mountains.</i></font>

133
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,260
<font color="yellow">I thought he was running
away from money he owed.</font>

134
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,610
<font color="yellow">Anyway, he ran away and never came back.</font>

135
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,290
<font color="yellow">Where are the back
mountains he ran away to?</font>

136
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,750
<font color="yellow">So, my honey lives in this neighborhood!</font>

137
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,850
<font color="yellow">I think Hyun Ji lives
around this area too...</font>

138
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,770
<font color="yellow">- You're here.
- Hello, Director.</font>

139
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,120
<font color="yellow">What's the schedule for today?</font>

140
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,590
<font color="yellow">You have three appointments today.</font>

141
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,860
<font color="yellow">- I'll change my clothes then.
- Okay.</font>

142
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,110
<font color="yellow">Even the clinic is cool
and clean like my honey.</font>

143
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,100
<font color="yellow">Something bad happened.</font>

144
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,160
<font color="yellow">He wasn't chasing something.
He was being chased.</font>

145
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,890
<font color="yellow">Hey, I told you to get some rest.
Why are you following me?</font>

146
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,420
<font color="yellow">I'm all better now.
Look, I'm fine.</font>

147
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,420
<font color="yellow">I swear, you don't listen.</font>

148
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,520
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll see you at
the study room at 11 o' clock.</i></font>

149
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,760
<font color="yellow">- Who is it?
- It's Senior Seo Yeon.</font>

150
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,540
<font color="yellow">We're supposed to talk about
the final project today.</font>

151
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,390
<font color="yellow">- Just the two of you?
- Yes.</font>

152
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,900
<font color="yellow">Wait for me!</font>

153
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,850
<font color="yellow">Remember the puppy factory incident
that was a huge issue a long time ago?</font>

154
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,940
<font color="yellow">Should we use that as our topic?</font>

155
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,810
<font color="yellow">Yeah, that sounds good.
We can include this as well.</font>

156
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,380
<font color="yellow">- I think that'll be fine.
- Okay, let's go with that.</font>

157
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,220
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and get it over with.</font>

158
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,880
<font color="yellow">Why here?</font>

159
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,790
<font color="yellow">What do you mean why?
We came to meet the investor.</font>

160
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,400
<font color="yellow">- But this is my grandma's house.
- Yes, it's your grandma's house.</font>

161
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,290
<font color="yellow">The investor is my grandma?</font>

162
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,020
<font color="yellow">That's correct.</font>

163
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,760
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep bringing
this up? It's ridiculous!</font>

164
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,890
<font color="yellow">You know very well that I moved out
because I don't want any help from her.</font>

165
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,510
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

166
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,360
<font color="yellow">We're not asking for a free ride.
We're asking her to take a chance on us.</font>

167
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,510
<font color="yellow">It's not necessary. Let's go.</font>

168
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,850
<font color="yellow">Let go, let go, let go!</font>

169
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,870
<font color="yellow">In Rang.</font>

170
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,030
<font color="yellow">- Grandma!
- Goodness, my precious baby!</font>

171
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,860
<font color="yellow">Goodness, when did you get here?</font>

172
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,790
<font color="yellow">You should've come to
me first and said hello!</font>

173
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,730
<font color="yellow">How long has it been?
Goodness, my precious baby!</font>

174
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,980
<font color="yellow">Hello, Grandma.</font>

175
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,210
<font color="yellow">Why do you have that
nuisance with you?</font>

176
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,410
<font color="yellow">I told you not to hang out
with people like that.</font>

177
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,650
<font color="yellow">It's good to have friends,
but you need to be more selective!</font>

178
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,630
<font color="yellow">Grandma, Chun Sang is a good person.</font>

179
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,600
<font color="yellow">- And he has something to say to you.
- What?</font>

180
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,180
<font color="yellow">What nonsense is he going
to talk about this time?</font>

181
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,500
<font color="yellow">I swear! Anyway, let's go inside!

182
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,520
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Come on in!</font>

183
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,650
<font color="yellow">Dig in, my precious baby.</font>

184
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:52,170
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you've lost so
much weight. Eat a lot.</font>

185
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,020
<font color="yellow">Goodness, look at you eat.</font>

186
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:05,250
<font color="yellow">Why are you so nervous?
Hurry up and dig in!</font>

187
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,490
<font color="yellow">- Dig in.
- Yes, thank you for the food.</font>

188
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,310
<font color="yellow">So, you have something to say to me?</font>

189
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,950
<font color="yellow">Yes, the thing is...</font>

190
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,690
<font color="yellow">We're thinking about starting
an international and trendy business...</font>

191
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,590
<font color="yellow">Talk slowly, you rascal!</font>

192
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,360
<font color="yellow">How dare you try to pull a con on me!</font>

193
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,540
<font color="yellow">Just get to the point.</font>

194
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:35,020
<font color="yellow">In Rang and I are trying
to start a proper business</font>

195
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,040
<font color="yellow">but we're struggling due to lack
of funds, so we came here to talk to you.</font>

196
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,550
<font color="yellow">It hasn't even started,
so why would you be struggling?</font>

197
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,790
<font color="yellow">What kind of business are you making?</font>

198
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,350
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes...</font>

199
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,740
<font color="yellow">- This is our business plan.
- What is it?</font>

200
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,100
<font color="yellow">Blood sausage soup?</font>

201
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,360
<font color="yellow">When did you prepare all this?</font>

202
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,520
<font color="yellow">You want to start a restaurant?</font>

203
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,660
<font color="yellow">No, it's not a restaurant.</font>

204
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,930
<font color="yellow">A state of the art
multi-communication system</font>

205
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,500
<font color="yellow">with a speedy, thorough,
and accurate 24-hour AS screen.</font>

206
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,600
<font color="yellow">We're planning to set
up a exorcism system!</font>

207
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,360
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

208
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,470
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

209
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,390
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

210
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,810
<font color="yellow">You con artist!</font>

211
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,510
<font color="yellow">Wait until I get my hands on you!</font>

212
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,590
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

213
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,110
<font color="yellow">- Let's stop here for today.
- It's over!</font>

214
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh, look at the time.
Do you want to eat lunch together?</font>

215
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,840
<font color="yellow">Lunch?</font>

216
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,630
<font color="yellow">What lunch? You're not
going to go, right, Bong Pal?</font>

217
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,820
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat together then.
- Good, let's go.</font>

218
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,990
<font color="yellow">What should we eat?</font>

219
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,920
<font color="yellow">Whatever you want to eat is fine.</font>

220
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:08,150
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, let's eat some other time.
I need to talk to Professor Joo.</font>

221
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,580
<font color="yellow">Sure, that's fine.</font>

222
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,660
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry. I promise to buy
you something really yummy next time.</font>

223
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,500
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. You should get going.
- I'll see you in class.</font>

224
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,030
<font color="yellow">What's up with that girl?
She's the one who asked you to lunch.</font>

225
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,030
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

226
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,620
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

227
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,080
<font color="yellow">Was Byul good while I was gone?</font>

228
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,530
<font color="yellow">He was very bad.
Maybe he takes after you.</font>

229
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,360
<font color="yellow">What? Really?</font>

230
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,260
<font color="yellow">I'm kidding. He was a good dog.</font>

231
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,350
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you have
a good time at the retreat?</font>

232
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,510
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

233
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,550
<font color="yellow">You said you're in the same
club as Bong Pal, right?</font>

234
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,700
<font color="yellow">- You two must be very close.
- Yes, I think so.</font>

235
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,390
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

236
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,290
<font color="yellow">- Professor.
- Yes.</font>

237
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,950
<font color="yellow">These are the list of
students for next semester.</font>

238
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,690
<font color="yellow">- I need your signature.
- Sure.</font>

239
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,830
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

240
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,040
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

241
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,000
<font color="yellow">So, what did you guys do at the retreat?</font>

242
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,010
<font color="yellow">Hello, Professor.</font>

243
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you again.</font>

244
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,460
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.
What brings you here today?</font>

245
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,190
<font color="yellow">We didn't come here to see you today.</font>

246
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,760
<font color="yellow">- Are you Im Seo Yeon?
- Yes, that's correct.</font>

247
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,840
<font color="yellow">There are several questions I'd like
to ask you in regards to No Hyun Joo.</font>

248
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,430
<font color="yellow">Do you have the time?</font>

249
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,060
<font color="yellow">Hyun Joo is dead?</font>

250
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,690
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's unfortunate,
but that's what happened.</font>

251
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,660
<font color="yellow">When was the last time you saw her?</font>

252
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,470
<font color="yellow">Well... she missed class last week.</font>

253
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,750
<font color="yellow">I think that was the last time.</font>

254
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,890
<font color="yellow">Do you remember how she was?</font>

255
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,330
<font color="yellow">Anything miniscule is fine.</font>

256
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,870
<font color="yellow">She looked... nervous that day.</font>

257
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,200
<font color="yellow">Hyun Joo!</font>

258
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,770
<font color="yellow">Hey, Seo Yeon.</font>

259
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,610
<font color="yellow">You missed class today.</font>

260
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,620
<font color="yellow">I just had something to take care of.</font>

261
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,610
<font color="yellow">But why do you ask?</font>

262
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,220
<font color="yellow">There were some
printouts today. Hold on.</font>

263
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,430
<font color="yellow">Hyun Joo!</font>

266
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,690
<font color="yellow">- Do you have that pen?
- No, I gave it to the professor.</font>

267
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,210
<font color="yellow">Professor?</font>

268
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, it belonged to
Professor Joo Hye Sung.</font>

269
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,450
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo Hye Sung
of the veterinary medicine department?</font>

270
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,290
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

271
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,630
<font color="yellow">And there's nothing else you remember?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[MONK MYUNG CHUL]</i></font>

275
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,360
<font color="yellow">Tell me!</font>

276
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,330
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Yeah?</font>

277
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,400
<font color="yellow">Did your grandma deposit
the money yet? Check again.</font>

278
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,460
<font color="yellow">You're really amazing.</font>

279
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,310
<font color="yellow">After all that abuse,
you still don't have it together.</font>

280
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,850
<font color="yellow">Why can't she understand
this awesome idea?</font>

281
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,970
<font color="yellow">Should we seek her out one more time?</font>

282
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,950
<font color="yellow">Well, if you want to die, then go ahead.</font>

283
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,380
<font color="yellow">Yo, Bong Pal! Long time no see.
Why didn't you come yesterday?</font>

284
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,370
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- What do you mean why?</font>

285
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,340
<font color="yellow">It's because we missed you.</font>

286
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,020
<font color="yellow">How come we don't have any work?</font>

287
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,080
<font color="yellow">After that one incident, that was it.</font>

288
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,360
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that, okay?</font>

289
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,770
<font color="yellow">Just think of it as a temporary break.</font>

290
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,620
<font color="yellow">Even frogs crouch and wait
like this before they jump.</font>

291
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,980
<font color="yellow">Yeah, just like that.</font>

292
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,150
<font color="yellow">I have something to give you.</font>

293
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,680
<font color="yellow">Here, these are yours.</font>

294
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,550
<font color="yellow">Those are the pictures
I took at the retreat.</font>

295
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you two look good together!</font>

296
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,190
<font color="yellow">You guys look like a couple.</font>

297
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,620
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go.</font>

298
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,310
<font color="yellow">Sure, see you.</font>

299
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,240
<font color="yellow">You two really look good
together! The perfect couple!</font>

300
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,580
<font color="yellow">- Are you stupid?
- What?</font>

301
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,070
<font color="yellow">There's something there.</font>

302
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,940
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

303
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,300
<font color="yellow"><i>My precious baby, Grandma
sent you some pocket money.</i></font>

304
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,480
<font color="yellow"><i>Make sure you eat on time
and buy lots of yummy food to eat.</i></font>

305
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,820
<font color="yellow"><i>And don't hang around with that loser.</i></font>

306
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,890
<font color="yellow">- But who's the loser?
- I don't know, loser.</font>

307
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,000
<font color="yellow">Why the library all of a sudden?</font>

308
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,240
<font color="yellow">Why do you think? We came to study.</font>

309
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,020
<font color="yellow">We can study at home.</font>

310
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,450
<font color="yellow">It's hot at home and it's cool in there.</font>

311
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,880
<font color="yellow">Then you study in the cool
library and I'll be at home.</font>

312
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,710
<font color="yellow">You're not going anywhere.
You have to study too. Follow me.</font>

313
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,860
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, I solved everything...</font>

314
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,170
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

315
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,030
<font color="yellow">Huh? Ah, nothing.</font>

316
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,020
<font color="yellow">- I solved everything.
- Already?</font>

317
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,630
<font color="yellow">I was there too.</font>

318
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,210
<font color="yellow"><i>[BONG PAL LOVES HYUN JI]</i></font>

319
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,870
<font color="yellow">Why are you all happy?</font>

320
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,120
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Nothing.</font>

321
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,050
<font color="yellow">Did you finish grading yet?
I did a good job this time, didn't I?</font>

322
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,290
<font color="yellow">How can you possibly smile
at a time like this?</font>

323
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,080
<font color="yellow">Did a good job? My butt.</font>

324
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,690
<font color="yellow">My teaching was such a waste of time.</font>

325
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,230
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it was number four.
I was so close.</font>

326
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,660
<font color="yellow">Why don't you give up taking the SAT?</font>

327
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,620
<font color="yellow">- How can your score not improve?
- Maybe I have a lousy teacher.</font>

328
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,410
<font color="yellow">What? You will never find
a teacher who is as good.</font>

329
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,450
<font color="yellow">This is because the student
just isn't smart enough.</font>

330
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,100
<font color="yellow">If you keep putting me down,
how can I possibly improve my score?</font>

331
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,380
<font color="yellow">Then what? What am
I supposed to do for you?</font>

332
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,290
<font color="yellow">Don't just push me, but reward me
like you give a carrot to a horse.</font>

333
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,920
<font color="yellow">Carrots, please.</font>

334
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,000
<font color="yellow">Carrots, my butt.</font>

335
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,430
<font color="yellow">If I do well on the exam,
you should reward me.</font>

336
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,300
<font color="yellow">Fine. All right.</font>

337
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,620
<font color="yellow">If you get higher than
80 points on the next exam</font>

338
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,500
<font color="yellow">I will grant one of your wishes.</font>

339
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,060
<font color="yellow">Really? Will you grant all my wishes?</font>

340
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,670
<font color="yellow">I will decide within my budget.</font>

341
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,010
<font color="yellow">- If it's something doable, I will.
- Hooray!</font>

342
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,050
<font color="yellow">You promised just now.
I will study really hard.</font>

343
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,080
<font color="yellow">It'll be a breeze to get
higher than 80 points.</font>

344
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,040
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

345
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,670
<font color="yellow">No, I thought she looked at me.</font>

346
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,490
<font color="yellow">- I might have seen it wrong.
- Let's go.</font>

347
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:33,760
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're studying at this hour?</font>

348
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,380
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm all motivated now.</font>

349
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,700
<font color="yellow">All the answers are number four.</font>

350
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,350
<font color="yellow">Wow, it looks good.</font>

351
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,480
<font color="yellow">- Fighting.
- Sure.</font>

352
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,040
<font color="yellow">Fighting.</font>

353
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,340
<font color="yellow">Come on, I asked you to do it with us
because Yoo Jin is good.</font>

354
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,100
<font color="yellow">Isn't Yoo Jin going
to prepare for the Olympiad?</font>

355
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,700
<font color="yellow">I was able to find a very good tutor.</font>

356
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,450
<font color="yellow">The tutor won't take
fewer than two students.</font>

357
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,260
<font color="yellow">If we take too long,
we may not be able to get in.</font>

358
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,300
<font color="yellow">Okay. I have to get
Eun Sung's snack ready now.</font>

359
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,380
<font color="yellow">All right then. Call me later.</font>

360
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,190
<font color="yellow">Eun Sung. Eun Sung.</font>

361
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,620
<font color="yellow">Eun Sung.</font>

362
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,060
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

363
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,080
<font color="yellow">Oh my, these look very expensive.
Seriously.</font>

364
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,960
<font color="yellow">By the way, why did we come here?</font>

365
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,480
<font color="yellow">What? What do you mean why?</font>

366
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,390
<font color="yellow">You know your clothes make
who you are, don't you?</font>

367
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,370
<font color="yellow">Look at Bong Pal.
Who would think he's an exorcist?</font>

368
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,620
<font color="yellow">We should order him a suit.</font>

369
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,000
<font color="yellow">We should have money first
to order him a suit.</font>

370
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, we do have money now from
the investment we received.</font>

371
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,690
<font color="yellow">The investment?</font>

372
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,690
<font color="yellow">How is that the investment?
It's my allowance!</font>

373
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,940
<font color="yellow">How dare you.</font>

374
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,690
<font color="yellow">Your money is my money.
My money is yours...</font>

375
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,910
<font color="yellow">We can't do that between us.</font>

376
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,940
<font color="yellow">Wow. How come you're
looking at a suit for yourself?</font>

377
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,410
<font color="yellow">I'm the face of our company.</font>

378
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,170
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

379
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,560
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask me to come here?</font>

380
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,790
<font color="yellow">I asked you here to order our uniforms.</font>

381
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,620
<font color="yellow">Uniform? I want to order
one for myself too.</font>

382
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,940
<font color="yellow">- What uniforms?
- Come here.</font>

383
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,830
<font color="yellow">It's okay, so come here.</font>

384
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,460
<font color="yellow">You should dress up like this, see?</font>

385
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,520
<font color="yellow">How cool is this?</font>

386
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,000
<font color="yellow">People won't look down on you
if you dress up like this.</font>

387
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,170
<font color="yellow">When you're this stylish,
you will bring more work, too.</font>

388
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,640
<font color="yellow">Go put it on. Come here.</font>

389
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,640
<font color="yellow">- Come over here.
- Well...</font>

390
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,310
<font color="yellow">Come on. Here...</font>

391
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,890
<font color="yellow">Try it on and come out.</font>

392
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,830
<font color="yellow">See? We already have a client.</font>

393
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,770
<font color="yellow">Hello, we provide exorcism service 24-7.
This is Choi Chun Sang.</font>

394
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,620
<font color="yellow">How may I help you?</font>

395
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,170
<font color="yellow">Wow, you look cool.</font>

396
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,350
<font color="yellow">You look the best among them.</font>

397
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:42,000
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, can you also get me a uniform?
I'm the only one without one.</font>

398
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,230
<font color="yellow">You keep asking me for things.</font>

399
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,440
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, hurry up.</font>

400
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,830
<font color="yellow">Get me one, please.</font>

401
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,640
<font color="yellow"><i>Open the door! I said open it!</i></font>

402
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,060
<font color="yellow">Open the door! Open it!</font>

403
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,170
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

404
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,080
<font color="yellow">Your hand...</font>

405
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:25,210
<font color="yellow"><i>Since that day, my child has...</i></font>

406
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:26,170
<font color="yellow">Eun Sung, you're wearing makeup...</font>

407
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,020
<font color="yellow">Take off those clothes. Now!</font>

408
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,850
<font color="yellow">- Leave me alone.
- What?</font>

409
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel sorry for your daughter
who has you as her mother?</font>

410
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,440
<font color="yellow">You don't know how much your daughter is
suffering because of your greed, do you?</font>

411
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,270
<font color="yellow">Eun Sung.</font>

412
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,890
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this, huh?</font>

413
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,520
<font color="yellow">Eun Sung?</font>

414
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,330
<font color="yellow">Your daughter is dead.</font>

415
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,440
<font color="yellow">How could she live with someone
like you? It's suffocating.</font>

416
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,670
<font color="yellow">That's why your husband cheated on you.</font>

417
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,310
<font color="yellow">He didn't want to live with you.</font>

418
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,890
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that?</font>

419
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,960
<font color="yellow">Come back.</font>

420
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,370
<font color="yellow">Come back!</font>

421
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,890
<font color="yellow"><i>Ever since that night</i></font>

422
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,020
<font color="yellow">I've taken her to
the hospital and shamans.</font>

423
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,750
<font color="yellow">It only made her symptoms worse.</font>

424
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,960
<font color="yellow">You have no idea
what a good daughter she was.</font>

425
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,850
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened to her...</font>

426
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,870
<font color="yellow">Eun Sung, please...</font>

427
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,190
<font color="yellow">- Please stop.
- <i>Open the door now!</i></font>

428
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,670
<font color="yellow"><i>Open the door! Open it!</i></font>

429
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,390
<font color="yellow">Eun Sung!</font>

430
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,890
<font color="yellow">I will go in.</font>

431
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,390
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

432
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,420
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, I'm not getting
a good feeling about this place.</font>

433
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,640
<font color="yellow">- So please be careful.
- I agree.</font>

434
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,170
<font color="yellow">Don't get hurt.</font>

435
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,910
<font color="yellow">I will be back.</font>

436
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,480
<font color="yellow">Are you like the shaman
I saw last time?</font>

437
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,540
<font color="yellow">No, you seem different.</font>

438
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,790
<font color="yellow">You came with something else, too.</font>

439
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,810
<font color="yellow">She's the one I saw at the library.
She also saw me then.</font>

440
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,810
<font color="yellow">A ghost went into her body.</font>

441
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,100
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

442
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,730
<font color="yellow">We should take the ghost out of her body.</font>

443
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,350
<font color="yellow">Who said you could do that?</font>

444
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,250

445

with her tagging along?</font>

446
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,050

447
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,500

448
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,060

454
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,620

You don't want Eun Sung to die.</font>

455

kill herself, so I'm just helping her.</font>

457
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,620

458
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920

459

462
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,190

463
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:19,170
<font color="yellow">I did that
because I wanted you to do well.</font>

464
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,960
<font color="yellow">But I was wrong.</font>

465
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,080

466
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,520

472

473
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,670

474
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,460
<font color="yellow">My child... Eun Sung.</font>

475
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,870

476
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:36,140

- Eun Sung.</font>

478
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,060
<font color="yellow">Mom, did I do this to you?</font>

479
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:50,540
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mom.
I was wrong. I'm sorry.</font>

480
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:57,520
<font color="yellow">No, I'm okay as long as you're okay.</font>

481
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

482
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mom.</font>

483
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,140
<font color="yellow">What can we do to help now?</font>

484
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,600
<font color="yellow">Go rest. We will take care of the rest.</font>

485
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,920
<font color="yellow">You go over there.</font>

486

487
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,290

in my dream last time</font>

488
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,250

- Who is she?</font>

489
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,770
<font color="yellow">My mom. She was my mom.</font>

490
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,690
<font color="yellow">She was just like Eun Sung's mom earlier.</font>

491
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,890
<font color="yellow">My mom would have cried just like her.</font>

492
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,870
<font color="yellow">It's good that you're getting
some memories back.</font>

493
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:11,210
<font color="yellow">If it's not my mom,
at least one person misses me.</font>

494
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,020
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I need to go study hard.</font>

495
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,190
<font color="yellow">Now take the exam.
You have one hour.</font>

496
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,870
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

497
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,140
<font color="yellow">I'm ready.</font>

498
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,960
<font color="yellow">Now you begin.</font>

499
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,890
<font color="yellow">Now take the exam.
You have one hour.</font>

500
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,660
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

501
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:50,750
<font color="yellow">I'm ready.</font>

502
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,290
<font color="yellow">Now you begin.</font>

503
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,100
<font color="yellow">What is it? My score isn't
higher than 80 points?</font>

504
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,430
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Seriously?</font>

505
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,330
<font color="yellow">Actually, yes.</font>

506
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,830
<font color="yellow">You did a good job. It was worth it.</font>

507
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,730
<font color="yellow">Of course it was worth it.
I tried so hard.</font>

508
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,680
<font color="yellow">So now you will grant my wish, won't you?</font>

509
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,870
<font color="yellow">- A promise is a promise, so...
- Yes!</font>

510
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,580
<font color="yellow">What is your wish?</font>

511
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,690
<font color="yellow">There is a place I've been wanting to go.</font>

512
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,550
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

513
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,060
<font color="yellow">- An amusement park.
- An amusement park?</font>

514
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,480
<font color="yellow">What are you, a kid?
Why would you want to go there?</font>

515
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,420
<font color="yellow">Only kids go there?</font>

516
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,400
<font color="yellow">You said you'd grant my wish. Let's go.</font>

517
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,510
<font color="yellow">Okay. Your wish isn't very grand.</font>

518
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,750
<font color="yellow">I will go with you.</font>

519
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,310
<font color="yellow">Since we're on the subject,
can we go tomorrow?</font>

520
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,410
<font color="yellow">- You said your exams are over tomorrow.
- That's right. Fine then.</font>

521
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,970
<font color="yellow">My exams will end at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.</font>

522
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,350
<font color="yellow">- Let's meet at 4:00 p.m. at the park.
- Sure.</font>

523
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,370
<font color="yellow">Hooray!</font>

524
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,640
<font color="yellow">Sir, this is Detective Yang.</font>

525
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,230
<font color="yellow">Detective Yang, what's up?</font>

526
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,290
<font color="yellow">You conducted an autopsy
on No Hyun Joo, didn't you?</font>

527
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:06,140
<font color="yellow">I already sent the document.
Didn't you get it yet?</font>

528
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,400
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. I just have
a few other questions.</font>

529
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,610
<font color="yellow">- What are they?
- <i>No Hyun Joo's neck was broken.</i></font>

530
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,760
<font color="yellow">Was there a chance it broke
when her body was tossed there?</font>

531
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,920
<font color="yellow">There is no chance.</font>

532
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,590
<font color="yellow">If it broke after she died</font>

533
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,700
<font color="yellow">there would be a visible
physical trace on the outside.</font>

534
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,570
<font color="yellow">But there was none.</font>

535
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,460
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

536
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,410
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm certain that her neck broke
when she was getting strangled.</i></font>

537
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:32,590
<font color="yellow">Can a human be strong enough
to break a live person's neck?</font>

538
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,140
<font color="yellow">It's not impossible,
but it's hard for average people.</font>

539
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,650
<font color="yellow">I see. Thank you, sir.</font>

540
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,680
<font color="yellow">- I will come by next time.
- <i>Do that.</i></font>

541
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:49,270
<font color="yellow">- I'm back.
- What is it?</font>

542
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,660
<font color="yellow">This is the video file of
the camera near No's place.</font>

543
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,000
<font color="yellow">- Did you find anything?
- Not really, but something was odd.</font>

544
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,580
<font color="yellow">- What was odd?
- You might want to see it yourself.</font>

545
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,140
<font color="yellow">Play it then.</font>

546
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,040
<font color="yellow">This is No Hyun Joo here.</font>

547
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,700
<font color="yellow">And then this corner here...</font>

548
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,900
<font color="yellow">Someone was there.</font>

549
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,680
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
- It didn't record from that point.</font>

550
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,350
<font color="yellow">They say it wasn't
a camera malfunction. Take a look here.</font>

551
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,290
<font color="yellow">For five minutes, the screen went blurry.</font>

552
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,040

553
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,470
<font color="yellow">And he also knows
how to manipulate the camera.</font>

Who is he, huh?</font>
