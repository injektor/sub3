<font color="yellow">So what's your wish?</font>

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,400
<font color="yellow">Well, my wish would be...</font>

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,370
<font color="yellow">What I said yesterday.</font>

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,190
<font color="yellow">I take it back.</font>

8
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,300
<font color="yellow">I don't like being uncomfortable
with each other.</font>

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,960
<font color="yellow">Just forget everything I said.</font>

10
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,380
<font color="yellow">That's my wish.</font>

11
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,860
<font color="yellow">One minute you're confessing
and now you want me to forget?</font>

12
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you confusing me?</font>

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,730
<font color="yellow">You understand, right?</font>

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,570
<font color="yellow">You have to grant my wish.</font>

15
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,640
<font color="yellow">If you do what I ask now</font>

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,880
<font color="yellow">I can stay with you longer.</font>

- Okay.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji.</font>

34
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,960
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Well. It's too hot.</font>

35
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
<font color="yellow">From now on, you can sleep in my room.</font>

36
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,450
<font color="yellow">- Me?
- Yes.</font>

37
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,160
<font color="yellow">I don't like hot weather.</font>

38
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,300
<font color="yellow">- Good night.
- Okay.</font>

39
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,710
<font color="yellow">Don't disappear.</font>

40
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,920
<font color="yellow">Never again.</font>

41
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,210
<font color="yellow">His father had an accident
and passed away when he was young.</font>

42
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,890
<font color="yellow">Thereafter, he has been living
with his mother.</font>

43
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,330
<font color="yellow">He lived in a dorm during
his middle school years.</font>

44
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,490
<font color="yellow">And he has been living alone since then.</font>

45
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,410
<font color="yellow">It seems like he keeps in touch
with his mother</font>

46
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,680
<font color="yellow">but they never visit each other.</font>

47
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,290
<font color="yellow">- Is this all?
- Yes.</font>

48
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,920
<font color="yellow">Honestly, there's nothing to look into.</font>

49
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,490
<font color="yellow">He's always on time with his bills.</font>

50
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,180
<font color="yellow">His hospital payment
record is also clean.</font>

51
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,850
<font color="yellow">The only thing we have is
his medical records.</font>

52
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,480
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- It's nothing special.</font>

53
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,270
<font color="yellow">It seems like he was very ill
when he was young.</font>

54
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,660
<font color="yellow">He has several medical reports.</font>

55
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,720
<font color="yellow">- What do other people say about him?
- They are all busy complimenting him.</font>

56
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,290
<font color="yellow">They said he is nice and diligent.</font>

57
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,390
<font color="yellow">It's obvious that they say that.
He participates in</font>

58
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,400
<font color="yellow">five different volunteer groups.
And he does surgeries for</font>

59
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,900
<font color="yellow">homeless dogs for free.</font>

60
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,420
<font color="yellow">People said they have never
seen him upset or irritated.</font>

61
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,410
<font color="yellow">He's a genius and has perfect
looks and a perfect personality.</font>

62
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,280
<font color="yellow">That's right. He is perfect.</font>

63
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,000
<font color="yellow">He's too perfect to be considered human.</font>

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,650
<font color="yellow">Not even a bit.</font>

65
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,430
<font color="yellow">Aren't we supposed to change
our investigation plan?</font>

66
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,290
<font color="yellow">- Did you find No Hyun Joo's cell phone?
- No.</font>

67
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,660
<font color="yellow">I contacted the phone company.</font>

68
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,980
<font color="yellow">They said that her phone was turned off
in front of her house.</font>

69
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,230
<font color="yellow">Check if we missed anyone
on her calls list.</font>

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,840
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- And track down her location.</font>

71
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,380
<font color="yellow">Check the path she took and compare it
to where we found the body.</font>

72
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,900
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

73
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,320
<font color="yellow">Did you hear how Hyun Joo died?</font>

74
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,140
<font color="yellow">- Her neck was broken.
- Really?</font>

75
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,600
<font color="yellow">- Oh my.
- Did they find a suspect?</font>

76
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,220
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

77
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,250
<font color="yellow">It's Eun Soo.</font>

78
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,690
<font color="yellow">- Who is he?
- Last semester</font>

79
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,770
<font color="yellow">he told Hyun Joo that he liked her.</font>

80
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,140
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo.</font>

81
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,020
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to
condole with her family?</font>

82
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,100
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Well. Professor Joo.</font>

83
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,790
<font color="yellow">You should go and comfort
them too. Bye.</font>

84
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,300
<font color="yellow">- Are you awake?
- Yes.</font>

85
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,010
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hungry? Wait just a bit.</font>

86
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,280
<font color="yellow">- Are you not eating?
- Huh? I'm eating.</font>

87
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,580
<font color="yellow">- What? Is it not good?
- Huh? No, it's delicious.</font>

88
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,490
<font color="yellow">Then why are you eating like that?</font>

89
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,030
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with it?
I always eat like this.</font>

90
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,440
<font color="yellow">It turned green. Let's run.</font>

91
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,130
<font color="yellow">What's the title of the book?</font>

92
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,670
<font color="yellow">Economic Theory.</font>

93
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,880
<font color="yellow">Economic Theory...</font>

94
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,370
<font color="yellow">It should be somewhere here.</font>

95
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,040
<font color="yellow">- Oh, it's right here.
- Huh?</font>

96
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,180
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

97
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,620
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

98
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,130
<font color="yellow">I have something to do.
See you later.</font>

99
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,430
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you going...</font>

100
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,750
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy.
- Thanks. Have a safe trip back.</font>

101
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,270
<font color="yellow">Hey, In Rang. Let's eat. Eat.</font>

102
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:26,020
<font color="yellow">Wow. One, two, three.</font>

103
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,400
<font color="yellow">Wow. Why do we have so many?</font>

104
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,940
<font color="yellow">I ordered one for Bong Pal too.</font>

105
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,780
<font color="yellow">So then with Bong Pal... We have three
people. But we have four of these.</font>

106
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,980
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

107
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:45,150
<font color="yellow">After you started earning money...
You spend too much. You have changed.</font>

108
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,870
<font color="yellow">Okay then.</font>

109
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,110
<font color="yellow">This one. Grilled beef bento.</font>

110
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,620
<font color="yellow">I like this a lot.</font>

111
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,870
<font color="yellow">I will try some.</font>

112
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,950
<font color="yellow">- This one is for Hyun Ji.
- What?</font>

113
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,890
<font color="yellow">- That's for Hyun Ji.
- Hyun...</font>

114
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,900
<font color="yellow">- Angel?
- Angel.</font>

115
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,980
<font color="yellow">You are so crazy about her
you might even forsake our country.</font>

116
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,340
<font color="yellow">You even bought shoes for a ghost.</font>

117
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,120
<font color="yellow">Love is crazy.</font>

118
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,660
<font color="yellow">Crazy. Crazy. You have gone crazy.</font>

119
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,900
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just date her?</font>

120
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,550
<font color="yellow">That's embarrassing.</font>

121
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,350
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

122
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,840
<font color="yellow">You are insane.</font>

123
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,460
<font color="yellow">Hey, you are a human and she is a ghost.
Don't you know what that means?</font>

124
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,690
<font color="yellow">She is a dead person. Okay?</font>

125
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,150
<font color="yellow">Why don't you marry her and have kids?</font>

126
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,720
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

127
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,910
<font color="yellow">Ghosts can't live with people.
Can't you understand that?</font>

128
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,430
<font color="yellow">But a wedding... You are far too ahead.</font>

129
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,760
<font color="yellow">You should go to
Sam Il Psychiatric Hospital.</font>

130
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,380
<font color="yellow">You should stay in a hospital.</font>

131
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,160
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Gosh.</font>

132
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,070
<font color="yellow">How could you eat now?</font>

133
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,350
<font color="yellow">We are going to eat together once
Hyun Ji and Bong Pal get here.</font>

134
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,630
<font color="yellow">Our angel is not even here yet.
How rude. How could you eat this?</font>

135
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,310
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

136
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,260
<font color="yellow">Don't move.</font>

137
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,840
<font color="yellow">I thought my heart was going to burst.</font>

138
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,370
<font color="yellow">If Kyung Ja was here,
we could talk about Bong Pal.</font>

139
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,330
<font color="yellow">Where is she anyway?</font>

140
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,220
<font color="yellow">Why is it so hard to see her these days?</font>

141
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,640
<font color="yellow">She's not here either.</font>

142
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,930
<font color="yellow">Did she go home?</font>

143
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,840
<font color="yellow">Oh, Pal, Pal, Pal. Welcome.</font>

144
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,460
<font color="yellow">- Hello, In Rang.
- Hi, Hyun Ji.</font>

145
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,000
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji didn't come with me.</font>

146
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,460
<font color="yellow">Really? Where is she?</font>

147
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,500
<font color="yellow">I think she went home.</font>

148
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,330
<font color="yellow">Our Bong Pal. Have a seat.</font>

149
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,630
<font color="yellow">Our Bong Pal, do you have any worries?</font>

150
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,180
<font color="yellow">- Well. A woman...
- A woman?</font>

151
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,670
<font color="yellow">I want to do something for her.</font>

152
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,510
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what I should do.</font>

153
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,420
<font color="yellow">- This is not about me.
- Yes, this is not about you.</font>

154
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,970
<font color="yellow">- This is about your friend, right?
- That's right.</font>

155
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,690
<font color="yellow">Woman. Woman.</font>

156
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,540
<font color="yellow">Woman. Female. Woman.</font>

157
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,010
<font color="yellow">Should I give you some
good dating advice?</font>

158
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:04,190
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to figure out what a woman
wants or what you should do for her.</font>

159
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,370
<font color="yellow">Dating? Do you know what love is?</font>

160
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:13,920
<font color="yellow">A baby bird like you should
stay out of this. Got that? Huh?</font>

161
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,280
<font color="yellow">Before you find out what she wants</font>

162
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,170
<font color="yellow">you should find out what type of person
she's attracted to.</font>

163
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,960
<font color="yellow">Assistant? Look here.</font>

164
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,650
<font color="yellow">It's okay even if
you are not that good-looking.</font>

165
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,000
<font color="yellow">Do this.</font>

166
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,890
<font color="yellow">Put your hand here like this.
Move your fingers.</font>

167
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,230
<font color="yellow">It's okay even if you look like a squid.</font>

168
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,860
<font color="yellow">Those are not men's charming points.</font>

169
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,700
<font color="yellow">Then what are men's charming points?</font>

170
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,270
<font color="yellow">In English, we call it "charming."</font>

171
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,800
<font color="yellow">Ah... Ah... Charming.</font>

172
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,180
<font color="yellow">Shall we start now?</font>

173
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,980
<font color="yellow">Step one.</font>

174
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:06,570
<font color="yellow">The side profile. The neck muscles
that symbolize masculine beauty</font>

175
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,370
<font color="yellow">and the sharp nose that is full of
intellectual beauty.</font>

176
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,300
<font color="yellow">When women see those things</font>

177
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,190
<font color="yellow">they will fall for you.</font>

178
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,340
<font color="yellow">They will totally fall for you.</font>

179
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,640
<font color="yellow">Step two.</font>

180
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,490
<font color="yellow">Eye contact.</font>

181
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
<font color="yellow">Eye contact.</font>

182
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,360
<font color="yellow">There are times when unpolished beauty</font>

183
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,170
<font color="yellow">and eyes that are like the ocean</font>

184
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,350
<font color="yellow">can do the trick.
When you look at her with those eyes</font>

185
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,760
<font color="yellow">she might melt like a glacier
because of global warming.</font>

186
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,630
<font color="yellow">She will melt like that.</font>

187
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,570
<font color="yellow">Step three.</font>

188
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,060
<font color="yellow">I'm okay, I'm okay.</font>

189
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,210
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't cry, you fool.</i></font>

190
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,880
<font color="yellow">You must be able to make her laugh
when she is in despair.</font>

191
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,280
<font color="yellow">When an apple smiles, what is it?</font>

192
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,220
<font color="yellow">A smiley apple.</font>

193
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,090
<font color="yellow">A sense of humor.</font>

194
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,410
<font color="yellow">We can say that the sense of humor is</font>

195
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,340
<font color="yellow">one of men's strongest charming points.</font>

196
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,650
<font color="yellow">Is this helpful to you?</font>

197
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,400
<font color="yellow">That's okay. I have eight more.
There are 11 steps.</font>

198
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,010
<font color="yellow">Step four.</font>

199
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,820
<font color="yellow">I think I'm okay. That's enough.</font>

200
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,010
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji.</font>

201
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,590
<font color="yellow">Kim Hyun Ji?</font>

202
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,510
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji.</font>

203
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,370
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

204
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,810
<font color="yellow">Where were you?</font>

205
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,290
<font color="yellow">I told you to stay by my side.
Don't disappear.</font>

206
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,290
<font color="yellow">I looked everywhere for you.</font>

207
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,820
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

208
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,790
<font color="yellow">- What were you doing?
- Nothing, really.</font>

209
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,230
<font color="yellow"><i>Charming.</i></font>

210
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,990
<font color="yellow"><i>What are men's charming points?</i></font>

211
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,210
<font color="yellow"><i>Step one.</i></font>

212
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,860
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Ji.
- Huh?</font>

213
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,560
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.
- Huh?</font>

214
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal?
- What?</font>

215
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,750
<font color="yellow">Are you not feeling well?
What's wrong with you?</font>

216
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,320
<font color="yellow">I have a stiff neck.</font>

217
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,740
<font color="yellow">- Is this not it?
<i>- Step two.</i></font>

218
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,350
<font color="yellow"><i>- Eye contact.
</i>- Eye contact. Okay.</font>

219
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,250
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Ji?
- Yes?</font>

220
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,990
<font color="yellow">What?
Do you want to have a staring contest?</font>

221
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,820
<font color="yellow">No. My eyes hurt.</font>

222
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,090
<font color="yellow">- Is this not it either?
<i>- Step three.</i></font>

223
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,070
<font color="yellow"><i>We can say that the sense of humor is</i></font>

224
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,480
<font color="yellow"><i>one of men's strongest charming points.</i></font>

225
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,390
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji, do you want me to
tell you something funny?</font>

226
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,360
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Who is the poorest king in the world?</font>

227
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,630
<font color="yellow">Hm...</font>

228
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,990
<font color="yellow">The king who earns the least.
Isn't this funny?</font>

229
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,340
<font color="yellow">- What is the hottest phone in the world?
- Well.</font>

230
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,780
<font color="yellow">Video call.</font>

231
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,490
<font color="yellow">Okay then.
When an apple smiles, what is it?</font>

232
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,450
<font color="yellow">Smiley apple.</font>

233
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,050
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you are okay?</font>

234
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,940
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

235
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,900
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

236
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,210
<font color="yellow">- This is not working.
- What is?</font>

237
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,880
<font color="yellow">Oh... It's nothing.</font>

238
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,520
<font color="yellow">Let's eat lunch.</font>

239
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,780
<font color="yellow">Meat! Meat! Meat! Wow!</font>

240
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,620
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's all done. Can I eat it now?</font>

241
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,190
<font color="yellow">- Here, eat it.
- Which one would be good?</font>

242
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,950
<font color="yellow">Meat is always the best.</font>

243
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,120
<font color="yellow">That star is the brightest.</font>

244
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,670
<font color="yellow">That one? That's Altair.</font>

245
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,650
<font color="yellow">The Altair and the Vega?</font>

246
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,770
<font color="yellow">Yes. And that one right there is Vega.</font>

247
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,200
<font color="yellow">The one spread out is the Milky Way.</font>

248
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,110
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's cool.</font>

249
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,080
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that before.</font>

250
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,640
<font color="yellow">Those two stars are really far apart.</font>

251
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,950
<font color="yellow">They must be sad.</font>

252
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,350
<font color="yellow">They only get to see each other once
a year and they are that far apart.</font>

253
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,750
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't they be happy because
they can at least see each other?</font>

254
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,380
<font color="yellow">Even if they only get
a day to see each other.</font>

255
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,970
<font color="yellow">How do you know so much
about constellations?</font>

256
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,550
<font color="yellow">Oh, my father taught me when I was young.</font>

257
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,940
<font color="yellow">- Shall I tell you more about it?
- Yes.</font>

258
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,780
<font color="yellow">The one shining on top is Aquila.</font>

259
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,810
<font color="yellow">So there's Aquila...</font>

260
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,080
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, are you asleep?</font>

261
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,550
<font color="yellow">Go to bed.
If you want to go out tomorrow...</font>

262
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,680
<font color="yellow">Really? Are you going on a date tomorrow?</font>

263
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,070
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

264
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,250
<font color="yellow">Okay. It's a date.</font>

265
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,580
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will get up early tomorrow.</font>

266
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,170
<font color="yellow">Good night. Dream of me.</font>

267
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,600
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do today?</font>

268
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,120
<font color="yellow">The things all the other couples do.
Eat out, have a cup of tea</font>

269
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,680
<font color="yellow">watch a movie, and walk together.</font>

270
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,690
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's do what other couples do.</font>

271
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,690
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

272
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,110
<font color="yellow">Oh. Hey!</font>

273
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey.</font>

274
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,970
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

275
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,790
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Sorry.</font>

276
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

277
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,500
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

278
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,150
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

279
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,310
<font color="yellow">What's taking her so long?</font>

280
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,810
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to
wear on a first date?</font>

281
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,380
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

282
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,520
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell me to leave first?</font>

283
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,170
<font color="yellow">Just...</font>

284
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,100
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

285
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,700
<font color="yellow">This is not it.</font>

286
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,680
<font color="yellow">It's just like the one you already have.</font>

287
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,770
<font color="yellow">It's not bad.</font>

288
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,580
<font color="yellow">Knock, knock.</font>

289
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,190
<font color="yellow">- Mister, what do you sell here?
- We sell maggolli.</font>

290
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,330
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? Can I have some?</font>

291
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,340
<font color="yellow">No drinking for you.</font>

292
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,950
<font color="yellow">What about this?</font>

293
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,080
<font color="yellow">You are so pretty.</font>

294
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,770
<font color="yellow">Two tickets for 10 o'clock.</font>

295
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,380
<font color="yellow">We have couple's seats and regular seats.
Which would you like?</font>

296
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,950
<font color="yellow">Couple's seat please.</font>

297
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,450
<font color="yellow">Just a moment please.</font>

298
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,930
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, let's eat that.</font>

299
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,220
<font color="yellow">Can you really eat this all by yourself?</font>

300
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,980
<font color="yellow">This is nothing for me.</font>

301
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,260
<font color="yellow">It feels like we're a real couple, right?</font>

302
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

303
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,160
<font color="yellow">What would you like to eat?</font>

304
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,640
<font color="yellow">What you want to eat.</font>

305
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,740
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

306
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,450
<font color="yellow">May I take your order?</font>

307
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,970
<font color="yellow">I will have Set Number Two.</font>

308
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,460
<font color="yellow">Set Number Two is for two people.</font>

309
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,180
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm okay with that.</font>

310
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,930
<font color="yellow">Oh, and can I have
another glass of water here?</font>

311
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,930
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

312
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,790
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

313
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,590
<font color="yellow">Aren't you doing too much today?</font>

314
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,040
<font color="yellow">You took me out to the movies
and a full-course meal.</font>

315
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,560
<font color="yellow">- I can handle it.
- But still...</font>

316
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,980
<font color="yellow">Fine. I will exorcise more
and make you a lot of money.</font>

317
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,220
<font color="yellow">They're all dead now.</font>

318
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,890
<font color="yellow">Sounds good.</font>

319
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,140
<font color="yellow">Wait. It's raining.</font>

320
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,450
<font color="yellow">Let's run.</font>

321
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,060
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

322
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,840
<font color="yellow">Shall we go?</font>

323
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:04,680
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, aren't you getting all wet?</font>

324
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,050
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Let's go.</font>

325
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,480
<font color="yellow"><i>[CRIME SCENES]</i></font>

326
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,110
<font color="yellow">Sir, are you going to question
the testifiers again?</font>

327
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,940
<font color="yellow">I should do something.</font>

328
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,020
<font color="yellow">The analysis team asked
me to give this to you.</font>

329
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,440
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

330
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,510
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

331
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,540
<font color="yellow">These are the photos from the toll gate.</font>

332
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,940
<font color="yellow">Sir, you might want to see this.</font>

333
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,810
<font color="yellow">The license plate matches, right?</font>

334
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,450
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's Professor Joo's plate number.</font>

335
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,450
<font color="yellow">Before we question the other testifiers</font>

336
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,040
<font color="yellow">bring Professor Joo to the station.</font>

337
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,300
<font color="yellow">- If he resists, arrest him.
- Yes, I will.</font>

338
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,930
<font color="yellow"><i>- A fountain pen?
- I gave it to Professor Joo...</i></font>

339
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,810
<font color="yellow">On the day No Hyun Joo
was murdered, where were you?</font>

340
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,520
<font color="yellow"><i>I was at my clinic.</i></font>

341
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,010
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

342
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,090
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji!</font>

343
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,530
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji. Did the power go out?</font>

344
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,840
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

345
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,340
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

346
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,520
<font color="yellow">- Are you feeling better?
- Yes, I am.</font>

347
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,230
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

348
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,150
<font color="yellow">There is something
I've been meaning to ask you.</font>

349
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,050
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

350
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,860
<font color="yellow">When did you start seeing ghosts?</font>

351
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,070
<font color="yellow">Maybe when I was five...</font>

352
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,110
<font color="yellow">I think it started from around then.</font>

353
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,480
<font color="yellow">You were so little.</font>

354
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,020
<font color="yellow">- How did it happen?
- I'm not sure.</font>

355
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,020
<font color="yellow">According to Monk Myung Chul</font>

356
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,960
<font color="yellow">there are still evil spirits inside me.</font>

357
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,790
<font color="yellow">Evil spirits?</font>

358
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,520
<font color="yellow">What are they?</font>

359
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,460
<font color="yellow">I don't really know.</font>

360
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,730
<font color="yellow">I don't remember much before I was five.</font>

361
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,840
<font color="yellow">It must have been scary all the time.</font>

362
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,980
<font color="yellow">I was at that time.</font>

363
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,040
<font color="yellow">I'm okay now.</font>

364
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,690
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Bong Pal.</font>

365
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,540
<font color="yellow">- For what?
- For everything.</font>

366
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,650
<font color="yellow">Everything seems good
when I'm with you.</font>

367
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,570
<font color="yellow">When I woke up as a ghost
without any memory</font>

368
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,980
<font color="yellow">I was so scared and lonely.</font>

369
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,790
<font color="yellow">But not anymore.</font>

370
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,630
<font color="yellow">Even if I don't get my memory back</font>

371
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,710
<font color="yellow">I like how things are now.</font>

372
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,190
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad that you can see me.</font>

373
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,270
<font color="yellow">I'm also glad that I can see you.</font>

374
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,590
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

375
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,820
<font color="yellow">It's a photo of your car taken
at dawn on the second.</font>

376
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,670
<font color="yellow"><i>Is it your license plate number?</i></font>

377
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's my car.</font>

378
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,130
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

379
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,960
<font color="yellow">You passed the toll gate at 11:28 p.m.</font>

380
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,710
<font color="yellow">You arrived at Insung at 1:38 a.m.</font>

381
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,230
<font color="yellow">You took Road 34.</font>

382
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,380
<font color="yellow">You got to Mount Woojung.</font>

383
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,320
<font color="yellow">You came back to Seoul
early that morning.</font>

384
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,360
<font color="yellow">- Do you remember?
- Yes.</font>

385
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know if you're aware.</i></font>

386
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,770
<font color="yellow">But No Hyun Joo's body
was found near Mount Woojung.</font>

387
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,070
<font color="yellow">She was murdered
on the night of the first.</font>

388
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,300
<font color="yellow">It appears her body was abandoned
in the early morning on the second.</font>

389
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:33,630
<font color="yellow">Is it a coincidence that you
happened to be near there?</font>

390
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,480
<font color="yellow">Why did you go to the mountain
in the middle of the night?</font>

391
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,110
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm a suspect.</font>

392
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,610
<font color="yellow">Please answer my question.</font>

393
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,690
<font color="yellow">I went to see my mother.</font>

394
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,290
<font color="yellow">My mother lives in the area.</font>

395
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,590
<font color="yellow">- Your mother?
- If needed, you can confirm it.</font>

396
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,110
<font color="yellow">- You're good at this, huh?
- Because it's the truth.</font>

397
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,340
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is Detective Kim.</font>

398
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,340
<font color="yellow">Sir, can I see you quickly?</font>

399
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,340
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

400
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,130
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

401
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,090
<font color="yellow">One of the witnesses
for the case just died.</font>

402
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,090
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

403
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,290
<font color="yellow"><i>His name is Lee Min Soo,
a student at Myungsung.</i></font>

404
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,210
<font color="yellow">Phone records show that he talked
to No Hyun Joo on the 30th.</font>

405
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,090
<font color="yellow">I included him on
the list for the testifiers.</font>

406
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,250
<font color="yellow">It appears he jumped
from his place and killed himself.</font>

407
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,650
<font color="yellow">- He committed suicide?
- Correct.</font>

408
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,730
<font color="yellow">And he claimed that
he killed No Hyun Joo.</font>

409
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,500
<font color="yellow"><i>The approximate time of his death is...</i></font>

410
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,710
<font color="yellow"><i>right after he came back
from No's funeral.</i></font>

411
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,250
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

412
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,150
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry. I killed Hyun Joo.</i></font>

413
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,800
<font color="yellow"><i>I didn't mean to do it.</i></font>

414
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,110
<font color="yellow"><i>He texted his mom
before he killed himself.</i></font>

415
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,050
<font color="yellow"><i>He said he killed her in the text.</i></font>

416
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,790
<font color="yellow"><i>No Hyun Joo's cell phone
was found in his room, too.</i></font>

417
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,710
<font color="yellow"><i>It seems that he was following her
around since last semester.</i></font>

418
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,300
<font color="yellow">The boss told me to wrap up this case.</font>

419
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,840
<font color="yellow">He wants us to investigate
a murder case in Woohyun.</font>

420
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,770
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

421
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,420
<font color="yellow">Get the documents
and put them on my desk.</font>

422
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,900
<font color="yellow">I will. Gosh.</font>

423
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,940
<font color="yellow">You're still here. Hello there.</font>

424
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,650
<font color="yellow">- Do you know the dog?
- Yes.</font>

425
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,170
<font color="yellow">When you gave me a hard time,
she was there for me.</font>

426
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,920
<font color="yellow">When did I give you a hard time?</font>

427
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,550
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

428
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,860
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's that handsome professor.</font>

429
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,360
<font color="yellow">Hello, Professor Joo.</font>

430
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

431
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,730
<font color="yellow">Well, I was looking at the dog...</font>

432
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:37,150
<font color="yellow">Were you?
Why don't you go in and look?</font>

433
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,480
<font color="yellow">- We can have some tea, too.
- I want to go in.</font>

434
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,440
<font color="yellow">Come on. Come inside.</font>

435
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,520
<font color="yellow">You look like you're
watching your girlfriend.</font>

436
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
- Why so surprised?</font>

437
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,340
<font color="yellow">You had love in your eyes.</font>

438
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,270
<font color="yellow">- I guess you like dogs, huh?
- Well...</font>

439
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,020
<font color="yellow">That dog is very pretty.</font>

440
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,360
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's almost summer break now.</font>

441
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,730
<font color="yellow">Have you completed
your volunteer hours yet?</font>

442
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,710
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

443
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,190
<font color="yellow">Then can you help me
with the volunteer work I'm doing?</font>

444
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,920
<font color="yellow">I can use some help these days.</font>

445
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,570
<font color="yellow">It will fill up your volunteer hours.
What do you think?</font>

446
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,440
<font color="yellow">It sounds good.</font>

447
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,730
<font color="yellow">I was looking for something actually.</font>

448
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,460
<font color="yellow">- Good then.
- Where are you going?</font>

449
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,590
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

450
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,270
<font color="yellow">Hey, puppy. Where are you?</font>

451
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

452
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,590
<font color="yellow">There you are.</font>

453
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:10,380
<font color="yellow">Come here. You're so pretty.</font>

454
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,840
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo.</font>

455
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:41,250
<font color="yellow">- I will go now.

<font color="yellow">It was not nice of you.</font>

458
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,400

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,020
<font color="yellow">- Professor Joo?
- Professor?</font>

466
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's a professor at my school.</font>

467

in your apartment building?</font>

Aren't you on your way home?</font>

473

Why do you have photos in the back?</font>

476
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,840

work on foundation courses.</font>

477
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,840

480
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,210
<font color="yellow">Is there something on the balcony?</font>

481
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,900
<font color="yellow">Nothing. It's nothing at all.</font>

482
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,460
<font color="yellow">By any chance, have you noticed
anything weird around you?</font>

483
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,150
<font color="yellow">No, nothing much.</font>

484
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,110
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- It's fine then.</font>

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,920
<font color="yellow">He can sometimes feel
the presence of ghosts.</font>

488
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,480
<font color="yellow">Did he save
his dad's contact information?</font>

489
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,940
<font color="yellow">He's his dad after all.</font>

490
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,940
<font color="yellow">He still hasn't saved
his contact information.</font>

491

492
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,960
<font color="yellow">May 13th?</font>

493
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,190
<font color="yellow">If this was sent on May 13th</font>

494
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,130
<font color="yellow">it's when he was still
staying at that place.</font>

495

499
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,420

Why do you ask?</font>

500
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,300
<font color="yellow">Nothing. Never mind
and get back to your things.</font>

502
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,360

503
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:51,420

504
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,620
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

505
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,400
<font color="yellow">If it was his graduation...</font>

506
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,400
<font color="yellow">Whatever happened at the graduation
that he sent such a text?</font>

507
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,020
<font color="yellow">Wait, he taped the graduation.</font>

508
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,630
<font color="yellow">Let me go find it.</font>

509
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,360
<font color="yellow">He definitely taped
the ceremony at that time.</font>

510
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,840
<font color="yellow">September, June, May... wait.</font>

511
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:36,710

it was February.</font>

520
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,340

Sit properly!</font>

551
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:56,860
<font color="yellow">So what is it that you want us to do?</font>

552
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,150
<font color="yellow">Once he falls back asleep like that</font>

553
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,270
<font color="yellow">he doesn't wake up for two days.</font>

554
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,190
<font color="yellow">He might be stable until then.</font>
