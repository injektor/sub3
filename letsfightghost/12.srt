She's going into cardiac arrest!

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,880
Is it cardiac arrest?

11
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,430
- Vitals!
- There's no pulse!

12

- It's charging.
- Clear! Shoot!

22
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:58,179
I told him to lie still on the bed! Where
did he go? Gosh, he sure doesn't listen.

23
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,050
He shouldn't be moving around.

Why are you crying?

33
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,390
You don't remember the accident?

34
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,539
An accident?

35
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,200
Me?

36
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,010
You've been in a coma for five years.
You don't remember?

37
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,249
Doctor, why doesn't
she remember anything?

38
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,869
Don't worry so much.

39
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,489
It's a minor aftereffect of being
in a coma for such a long time.

40
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,900
Your memories will return in time.

41
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,350
Let's make sure your condition is
stable first and do a physical exam.

42
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,780
Let's just be thankful
that she's awake now.

43
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,389
Congratulations, Hyun Ji.
I'll see you again.

44
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,149
Yes.

45
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,689
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

46
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,749
- Hyun Ji.
- Hyun Ji.

Continue to follow up on Kim Hyun Ji.

49
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,249
There might be
a problem with her memories

50
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,689
so set up a consultation with
the neurology department.

51
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,590
Yes, Professor.

You really don't remember anything?

54

Yes, I don't remember anything.

55
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,400
My head just hurts a little.

56
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,289
Don't try too hard to remember.

57
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,920
Those memories aren't important.

58
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,670
Not when you came back alive.

59
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,700
I'm so happy.

60
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,589
It's okay.

61
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,029
Why are you crying if you're happy?

62
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,450
Don't cry.

63
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,169
Not you too, Dad.

64
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,429
You've been through a lot.
Thank you for staying alive.

65
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,350
- Don't, Mom.
- Thank you, Hyun Ji.

66
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,619
Doctor, are his BP and OP okay?

67
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,249
He's not going into
cardiac arrest, is he?

68
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,149
Don't you need to intubate
him or give him an EPI?

69
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,969
You've watched too many medical dramas.

70
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,069
That's not necessary
and his x-rays are fine.

71
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,519
But it seems like he's
overworked himself lately.

72
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,089
He's exhausted and his
nutritive condition is a mess.

73
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,510
I've prescribed him vitamins. He can be
discharged after he rests the whole day.

74
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,390
- Yes, Doctor.
- Thank you.

75
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,560
I guess he eventually
collapsed after Hyun Ji left.

76
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,860
Bong Pal was struggling? Why?

77
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,900
Huh?

78
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:57,009
Well, I guess Bong Pal
and Hyun Ji were kind of an item.

79
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,850
An item...

80
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,700
Hyun Ji has feelings for Bong Pal?

81
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,909
I think Bong Pal has
feelings for Hyun Ji too.

82
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,750
That's why he's in
this state after she left.

83
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:19,569
You know, getting hurt from
a painful breakup is every man's fear.

84
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,750
So that's what happened.

85
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,300
Hyun Ji and Bong Pal were...

86
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,950
I see.

87
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,940
Are you okay?

88
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,009
I'm okay, I'm okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

89
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,430
And don't try to hurt Bong Pal.

<i>[FLOWER VIRGIN SHAMANESS]</i>

91
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,089
Is it true that there's one more weapon?

92
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,150
I heard the head monk prepared one.

93
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,870
Hong Myung Hee met the head
monk before she passed away.

94
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,050
I heard she asked him
to prepare another weapon.

95
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,719
One more?

96
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,139
By any chance, do you
know where that weapon is?

97
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,720
He passed away and that's all I heard.

98
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,709
There's one more weapon.

99
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,069
She had it made for the sake of her son.

100
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,850
I'm sure having that made was not easy.

101
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,909
Do you maybe think the personal item
Bong Pal's father went looking for....

102
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,979
It was the weapon.

103
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,689
Then the reason why that evil
spirit is hanging around Bong Pal...

104
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,379
It's because of that weapon.

105
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,790
That's his lifeline.
That's why the bastard is chasing him.

106

- You're leaving already?
- Yes.

He's not seriously injured.
He just passed out from exhaustion.

The doctors says he'll be
fine after a day of rest.

Yes... we're Bong Pal's seniors

You're the punks I met at Gampo.

148
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,050
So, you punks are using Bong Pal
to catch ghosts, is that it?

149
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,699
We're not using him.

150
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,300
This is a mutual and beneficial
partnership we both agreed upon...

- You punk!
- Don't do this.

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,550
Don't you know how
dangerous exorcism is?

00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,530
It does look a bit dangerous,
but this is the 21st century...

Why you little punk!

155

- I was wrong!
- Are you going to continue or not?

Goodness, you rascal.
You get sick because of that one ghost.

You guys stay right next to Bong Pal.

160
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,089
Don't go anywhere.
I'm going to meet the doctor.

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,180
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,720
Goodbye.

163
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,519
I thought he was about to
rip my ears off. Seriously.

164
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,730
- Who is that monk?
- I don't know. A relative, maybe?

165
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,719
Aren't you hungry?
Should we go eat something?

166
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,530
I'll go and buy something.
Stay here, I'll be back.

Okay, try closing your hand.

169
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,950
Open it up again.

170
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,560
Put more strength into it.

171
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,240
Fortunately, there is
nothing wrong with her nerves.

172
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,139
You need to continue to exercise
your hands to relax the muscles.

173
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,899
Practice using a spoon
or chopsticks often.

174
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,529
- Writing is fine too.
- Yes, Doctor.

175
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,190
Walking is too much for now,
so use the wheelchair.

176
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,989
And the hospital prepared this
congratulatory gift for you.

177
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,229
Congratulations once
again on waking up.

178
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,289
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,120
Congratulations.

180
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,109
Who is it, anyway?

181
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,160
It's the girl who woke up after
being in a coma for five years.

182
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,200
The girl from the car accident?
I'm glad to hear she's awake.

183
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,710
Hyun Ji...

184
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,850
<i>[KIM HYUN JI]</i>

185
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,580
Is she really...

186
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,040
Hyun Ji.

187
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,200
Hyun Ji... Hyun Ji!

188
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,019
Hyun Ji.

189
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,030
What's wrong?

190
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,060
Hey, hey! Hey.

191
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,409
- I have to find Hyun Ji.
- No, no. Wait a minute! Sit down!

192
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,050
Wait. You're burning up. The doctor says
you have to be calm. Stay still, okay?

193
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,639
Chun Sang, Chun Sang,
Chun Sang! Bong Pal!

194
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,329
I'm so glad you're here, In Rang.
He's frantic to find Hyun Ji.

195
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,769
- I saw Hyun Ji!
- What?

196
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,729
You saw Hyun Ji?

197
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,919
Yes, I saw her at the
hospital ward on the way here.

198
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,049
What nonsense are you spouting?
How can you see a ghost?

199
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,659
No, she looked exactly like Hyun Ji...
No, she's Hyung Ji for sure.

200
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,489
The name tag next to her
room says Kim Hyun Ji too.

201
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,770
Come here.

202
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,750
You're burning up too,
so get a shot while you're here.

203
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,520
No! People are saying that she
woke up from a five-year coma!

204
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,279
Hey, Bong Pal! Bong Pal!

205
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,680
Move! He was just getting stabilized!
Why did you have to bring up Hyun Ji?

206
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
- It's that way!
- Bong Pal!

207
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,530
Where did he go?

208
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,490
Bong Pal.

209
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,540
Bong Pal.

210
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,860
<i>[KIM HYUN JI]</i>

211
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,270
Hyun Ji.

212
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,629
You're alive. I thought you disappeared.
I was so worried about you.

213
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,650
What are you doing?

214
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,729
Hyun Ji.

215
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,750
Who are you?

216
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,439
You... don't recognize me?

217
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,920
Who are you?

218
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm... Bong Pal.
Don't you remember?

219
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,000
Look... I don't know
how you know my name.

220
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,870
But I really don't know who you are.

221
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,600
Please leave.

222
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,940
- Hyun Ji.
- Mom.

223
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,449
Who are you?
Do you know him?

224
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,680
No, I don't know him.

225
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,190
Who are you?

226
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm sorry.

227
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,220
I must've mistaken you for someone else.

228
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,980
What the heck?

229
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,390
Hey.

230
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,639
It's Hyun Ji, right?
What did she say?

231
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,690
What did Hyun Ji say?

232
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,629
She... doesn't remember me.

233
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,410
- What?
- She doesn't remember?

234
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,860
Yes.

236
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,619
- Are you sure that's Hyun Ji?
- I'm sure.

237
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,699
Look at her. There's no one prettier
than Hyun Ji in all of Korea.

238
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,570
- In all of Korea?
- Yes.

239
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,520
She is pretty, I guess. I don't know.

240
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,770
Hi.

241
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,689
Oh no, she must not remember me either.

242
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,569
How can she remember you when
she can't even remember Bong Pal?

243
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,839
But why can't she remember?

244
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,309
- She was in a coma for five years?
- Yeah.

245
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,909
Then you're saying Hyun Ji
was a soul, not a ghost, right?

246
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,269
I guess she was in limbo.

247
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:23,020
She came back into her own body and
forgot everything that happened with us.

248
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,350
What do you want me to do about it?

249
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,690
Excuse me... beautiful nurses.

250
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,540
- Yes.
- We have some questions to ask.

251
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,190
Sure, go ahead.

252
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,740
- Who are you? Do you know him?
- No, I don't know him.

253
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,620
Bong Pal. Bong Pal!

254
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,029
Mong Myung Chul.

255
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,859
Who says you can leave the hospital?

256
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,609
- I've been looking all over for you.
- How did you find me?

257
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,849
Your seniors or whatever told me.

258
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,199
I can't believe you're
friends with idiots like that.

259
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,880
They're of no help to you.

260
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,550
Are you feeling better?

261
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,429
Yes.

262
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,869
You need to take better care of yourself.

263
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,669
Let's go. You have to
eat well at a time like this.

264
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,649
Let's go and get you something to eat.

265
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,889
Taxi! Hurry up.

266
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,710
Over here.

267
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,900
Stop!

268
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,180
Wow, the quality of this oxtail is good.

269
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,119
- Monk, I'll do it.
- Go away.

270
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,369
I can do this better than you.

271
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,279
I'm fine. I'll do it.

272
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,139
Listen, will you?

273
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,440
Go and get some rest.

274
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,600
Okay.

275
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,879
Monk Myung Chul.

276
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,419
What is it?

277
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm sorry for yelling at you last time.

278
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,810
That rascal even knows how to apologize.
He's all grown up.

279
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,070
Let's see here.

280
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,070
<i>Bong Pal.</i>

281
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,149
<i>Bong... Bong Pal.</i>

282
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,740
<i>Bong Pal. Bong...</i>

283
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,410
<i>Bong Pal.</i>

284
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,960
Bong Pal.

285
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,089
- Senior.
- Here.

286
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,529
Ah, you came here to bring me this.

287
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,449
- I could've come and gotten it.
- Well, we need to talk too.

288
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,730
- What is it?
- The thing is...

289
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,539
So, you're not the only one
that Hyun Ji can't remember.

290
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,179
They say she can't remember
what happened five years ago.

291
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,449
Hyun Ji was a victim
of a hit-and-run accident.

292
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,289
I think she has problems
remembering because of trauma.

293
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,399
The amnesia is only temporary.

294
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,920
Her memories will return in time,
so don't be so disappointed.

295
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,800
We should be ecstatic
and grateful that Hyun Ji is alive.

296
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,720
And at times like this, you should
be by her side, don't you think?

297
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,980
<i>You punks!</i>

298
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,029
Who came back alive
from a hit-and-run accident?

299
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,119
Hello, sir.

300
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,039
What?

301
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,469
Bong Pal left his bag behind
and we brought it for him.

302
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,650
We'll be on our way now.

303
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,980
Goodbye.

304
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,660
See you later.

305
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,440
Bong Pal, is Hyun Ji alive then?

306
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,850
Yes, she's in the
hospital I was staying at.

307
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,140
That child was not a ghost.

308
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,100
Unbelievable.

309
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,440
He should be jumping up and down
with joy. Why does he look so down?

310
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,000
<i>We should be ecstatic
and grateful that Hyun Ji is alive.</i>

311
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:04,970
<i>And at times like this, you should
be by her side, don't you think?</i>

312
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,690
Are you okay after
saying all that to him?

313
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,519
About what?

314
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,409
Well, you're trying to get
Hyun Ji and Bong Pal together.

315
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,269
Have you completely
given up on her then?

316
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,100
Hyun Ji's happiness is my happiness.

317
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,210
I'm good as long as she's happy.

318
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,000
Plus, there something
more important than that.

319
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,890
What is it?

320
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,960
We have to catch
that punk and get revenge.

321
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,589
Who?

322
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,760
The bastard that put her
in a coma five years ago.

323
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,300
It's my life's mission
to catch that punk.

324
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,819
- Chun Sang.
- Yeah?

325
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,820
Do you have
that detective's business card?

326
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,219
Business card?

327
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,440
The business card we got
from that detective...

328
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,190
The business card we
got when Sadako died.

329
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,719
Ah!

330
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,310
I have it, I have it, I have it.
I do have it. Here it is.

331
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,640
Let's go.

332
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,630
To the police station.

333
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,820
Let's go! To the police station!

334
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,020
Goodness, it's not even a case.

335
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,669
Why did you come all the way here?

336
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,369
There's something I need
to find out personally.

337
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,429
This is old news.
It's a simple accident.

338
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,010
There's nothing to look over.

339
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,949
Is the scene of the crime still there?

340
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,179
Why? You want to go there?

341
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,850
Yes.

342
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,759
Okay, he fell right here.

343
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,940
Anyway, he was already
dead when we arrived.

344
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:48,080
I think he died from internal bleeding.

345
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,549
One of the residents discovered
the body while passing by.

346
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,990
<i>She said she didn't see him fall.
That's what happened.</i>

347
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,020
Is anyone there? Someone help!

348
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,730
A straight fall from the 15th floor.

349
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,800
What? You want to go
up to the 15th floor?

350
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,969
- Hello.
- Who are you?

351
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,439
- We called you earlier.
- Ah, yes.

352
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,239
- We're from the police station.
- I see.

353
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,649
- Please excuse us for a moment.
- Please excuse us for a moment.

354
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,909
It's nothing really.

355
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,279
This detective is from Seoul and he
just wants to take a quick look around.

356
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,609
- It'll only be for a moment.
- Sure, go ahead.

357
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,900
Thank you.

358
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,960
There was no self-defense whatsoever.

359
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,650
It's hard to say it was manslaughter.

360
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,940
And there was no letter or statement
left behind to indicate it was suicide.

361
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:22,349
It was written on the autopsy
report that he drank a lot.

362
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:28,279
So he drank, smoked, and did this.

363
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,830
He lost his balance.

364
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,740
He tilted over and lost his balance.

365
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,209
Do you remember who
was there at that time?

366
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,610
When I went up...

367
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,330
<i>the wife was there.</i>

368
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:06,189
<i>She didn't know that her husband fell.</i>

369
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,669
<i>Was the son at home by any chance?</i>

370
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,120
<i>His name is Joo Hye Sung.
He was 13 years old at the time.</i>

371
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,910
<i>Yes, the son was home.</i>

372
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,019
- Yeah, what is it?
- Senior.

373
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,349
- Where are you right now?
- Did you get something?

374
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,929
The chief is looking all over for you.

375
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,989
- You need to get back immediately.
- I'm on my way.

376
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,539
Why are you so concerned
with a simple freak accident?

377
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,889
- Did you find something?
- I don't think it was a freak accident.

378
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,169
<i>What?</i>

379
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,119
The railing is about one meter tall.

380
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,949
Joo Hye Sung's father
was 173 centimeters tall.

381
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,609
Even if he stood by the railing, it'd be
hard for him to fall over on his own.

382
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,690
That's unless someone
pushed him from behind.

383
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,779
The only people who were home
were the wife and Joo Hye Sung.

384
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,440
So, what are you going to do?

385
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,220
I'm going to reinvestigate
Professor Joo Hye Sung.

386
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,570
Slowly.

387
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,750
Very good. Pull a little more.

388
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,869
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

389
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,310
I'm going to increase
the speed just a little bit.

390
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,920
Hello?

391
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,600
Yes.

392
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,300
- Let's stop right here for today.
- Okay.

393
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,260
Be careful.

394
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,769
You're doing very well.

395
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,159
The muscles are responding well,
so you should be able to use crutches.

396
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,419
Even though it's hard,
you have to keep it up.

397
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,820
I will.

398
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,639
Where did my mom go?

399
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,469
- Should I take you to your room?
- No, I'll do it.

400
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,899
- This is considered exercise too.
- Okay then.

401
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,430
- Thank you.
- Good job today.

402
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

403
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,680
Hello, Doctor.

404
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,480
- Hello, Miss Hyun Ji.
- Hello.

405
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,880
This is a piece of cake.

407
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,519
Are you okay?

408
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Yes.

409
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,290
You look tired. Where is your room?
I'll take you there.

410
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,759
Thank you.

411
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,510
You're welcome.

412
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,199
It must be your first time
in a wheelchair.

413
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,919
You looked very clumsy.

414
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,659
Ah, yes. I've only been
using it for several days.

415
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,079
You should be careful.
It's actually quite harder than it looks.

416
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,979
- Are you a doctor here?
- No.

417
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,350
I used to volunteer at a hospital,
which is when I tried one out.

418
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,030
I see.

419
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,680
I hear you were in
a coma for five years.

420
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,299
Oh, how did you find out?

421
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,640
What kind of accident was it?

422
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,449
A hit-and-run accident.

423
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,320
But the truth is, I don't remember.

424
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,779
Not even remotely?

425
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,809
Yes, the doctor says
it's because of the shock.

426
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,750
But he says my memories
will return with time.

427
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,350
What a relief.

428
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,029
Hyun Ji.

429
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,819
It's my mom.

430
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,550
Mom.

431
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,760
Where were you?
I was looking all over for you.

432
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,669
Who is he?

433
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,959
Ah, this person escorted me.

434
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,320
Really? Thank you.

435
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:46,229
- You're too kind.
- Not at all. I'll be on my way now.

436
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,100
- Good luck.
- Yes, thank you.

437
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,720
Who is he?

438
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,900
He is so good-looking.
He's exactly my type.

439
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,330
Oh.

440
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,849
A present for you.

441
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,730
What is it?

442
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,539
This is mine?

443
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,150
- Yes.
- Thank you!

444
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,540
Nice.

445
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,450
Come in.

446
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,990
What the heck? He's here again.

447
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,290
I'm not a strange person,
so don't be afraid of me.

448
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,290
I want to apologize for last time.
I didn't know you lost your memories.

449
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,150
What are you doing?

450
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,809
It's my student ID.

451
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,849
I'm a sophmore business
major at Myungsung University.

452
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,869
Call the school if you doubt me.

453
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,550
Why did you come again?

454
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,150
You're going to regret treating me
like this once your memories return.

455
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,830
Regret, my butt.

456
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,090
Just who are you to keep
bothering me like this?

457
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,999
Park Bong Pal.

458
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,649
Park Bong Pal?

459
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,670
That's right, Park Bong Pal.

460
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,889
Your boyfriend.

461
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,900
- Granted, you don't remember.
- What?

462
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,399
Boyfriend?

463
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,820
Yes.

464
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,409
We were an item? I dated you?

465
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,940
Yes.

466
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,149
No, it's more like we lived together.
That's a more accurate expression.

467
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,220
What are you saying?
Why would I live with you? When?

468
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,429
- When you were a ghost.
- What? A ghost?

469
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,969
- You've lost your mind!
- I'm perfectly fine.

470
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,970
- You chased me around.
- No way.

471
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,680
You're not my type. Get out.

472
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,809
You don't have to remember right away.

473
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,390
I'm grateful that you're alive
and well and haven't disappeared.

474
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,249
You bought a new cell phone.

475
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,279
What are you doing?

476
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,780
I'm giving you my number.
Call me if you miss me.

477
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,570
Get out. Get out!

478
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,240
- I came back to return your stuff today.
- Today?

479
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,860
- You're coming again tomorrow?
- Yes.

480
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,630
Don't ever come again. I swear I'll call
the cops on you if you come tomorrow!

481
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,569
I'm coming tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

482
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,029
I'm going to come every day
until you remember.

483
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,140
Every single day.

484
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,120
See you tomorrow.

485
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,410
Ah... and call me if you
want to hear my voice.

486
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,960
Wow.

487
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,609
<i>[MY LOVE BONG BONG]</i>

488
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,260
What a crazy bastard!

489
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,689
What is it?

490
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,729
What's wrong? Did something happen?

491
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,809
No, it's nothing.

492
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,750
- Did you buy this?
- No!

493
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,110
Just throw it all away. The books too.

494
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,950
It's the exact same
thing you used before.

495
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,059
- Really?
- Really.

496
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,629
You always used
a pink cup and toothbrush.

497
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,119
- Did I?
- You did. Ever since you were little.

498
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:54,500
You threw such a fit
if I bought you a different color.

499
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,899
Mom, wait.

500
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,240
What is it?

501
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,599
Just leave it there for now.

502
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,989
You're so wishy-washy.

503
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,590
Here.

504
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,110
Let's see here.

00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,020
Hey, Kim Hyun Ji.

508
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,879
What is it? Are you in pain?

509
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,640
My head hurts.

510
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,170
Hyun Ji.

511
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,930
- Let's go.
- Sure.

512
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,899
For a patient who was in a coma for five
years, your recovery speed is amazing.

513
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,880
- You're in great condition too.
- Really?

514
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,029
When do I get discharged then?
It's so stuffy in here.

515
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,670
At this rate, you can start receiving
outpatient treatment in three days.

516
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,310
Yes!

517
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,740
Is he not here today?

518
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,570
It's strange not seeing him.

519
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,610
No, what am I talking about?

520
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,640
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

521
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,780
I am going to introduce
you to a new friend today.

522
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,699
This fellow's name is Happy.

523
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,399
- It's that guy from last time.
- And he's three years old.

524
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,959
What is he doing?

525
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,899
What are all of your names? Can you
please introduce yourself to Happy?

526
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,649
- Yes!
- You go first.

527
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:59,739
- Hi, I'm Ji Woo.
- Hi, Ji Woo.

528
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,679
- Hi, I'm Hyun Soo.
- Hi, Hyun Soo.

529
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,389
- Hi, I'm Seo Woo.
- Hi, Seo Woo.

530
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:10,109
Now that we've introduced ourselves,
how about we get friendlier with Happy?

531
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,819
Yes!

532
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,769
All you have to do is
gently pet him, okay?

533
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,460
Yes.

534
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,239
Gently. Happy might get scared.

535
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,810
- Hi.
- Be gentle.

536
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,069
He's so cute.

537
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,730
He's so soft and cute.

538
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,089
- Thank you.
- Bye.

539
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,219
Yes, goodbye.

540
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,250
Bye, see you next time.

541
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,639
You look much better.
I see that you can walk now.

542
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,140
Yes.

543
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,249
He's so cute.

544
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,089
You said you do volunteer work.
Do you volunteer here as well?

545
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,259
- Yes.
- What did you just do now?

546
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:03,870
Pet therapy. It helps patients recover
from or better cope with health issues.

547
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,310
It's a type of pyschotherapy.

548
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,199
I probably need it too.

549
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,869
Of course.

550
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:13,240
- Do you want to hold him?
- Yes.

551
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,250
Here you go.

552
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,280
- His name is Happy.
- Hi, Happy.

553
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:38,979
Excuse me, is this Kim Hyun Ji's room?

554
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,670
Yes, that's correct.
How did you get here?

555
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,319
- Did she go somewhere?
- Yes, she left for physical therapy.

556
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,179
Who are you?

557
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:53,930
Kim Hyun Ji and I don't really
know each other very well.

558
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,289
By any chance, are you her mother?

559
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,750
Yes.

560
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,810
Congratulations on
your daughter waking up.

561
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,370
This is my gift.

562
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,640
- Thank you.
- I'll get going.

563
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,909
Wait, sir.

564
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,690
Who should I say came to visit her?

565
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:26,989
Tell her a mean monk who once
said some harsh words to her came.

566
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,820
Please tell her I'm sorry.

567
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,140
Have a good day.

568
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,130
Ah, so you're a professor.
No wonder.

569
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,509
The school you're teaching at
is the school I wanted to attend.

570
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,070
I was going to apply to Myungsung
University before the accident.

571
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,120
I'd probably be graduating by now.

572
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,399
Come visit the school
once you're discharged

573
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,070
and attend one of my classes.

574
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,929
- Really? I can do that?
- Of course.

575
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,769
I get discharged in three days.
Can I come then?

576
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,420
- Yes.
- Yes!

577
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,980
Why is that punk here?

578
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,319
Monk Myung Chul.

579
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,980
Hey, Bong Pal.

580
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,709
What are you doing here?

581
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,450
Oh, just because. Just because.

582
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,410
Why are Hyun Ji
and the professor together?

583
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,320
Hyun Ji?

584
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:47,310
Ah, the girl next to that
professor is Hyun Ji, huh?

585
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,570
Yes.

586
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,550
Monk Myung Chul.

587
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,790
Monk Myung Chul.

588
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,120
It's nothing. I'm going to leave first.

589
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,689
You scared me.

590
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,799
You look like you're
in a good mood today.

591
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,839
I was in such a good
mood before I saw you.

592
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,569
I was wondering why
you didn't come today.

593
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,460
- Were you waiting for me?
- You wish!

594
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,819
Wait... Do you remember anything?

595
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,200
Go to a mental institute
and stop bothering me!

596
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,089
What about lunch? Did you eat?

597
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:51,989
What's it to you if I eat or not?

598
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,429
It's boring eating
hospital food every day.

599
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,779
I packed a lunch today.
Let's go eat it together.

600
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,779
No thank you. You eat it.

601
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,860
I bought jangjorim and meat.

602
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,130
Meat?

603
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,150
Yes, meat.

604
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,790
Here, dig in.

605
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,979
Just because I'm eating this doesn't
mean that I've opened up to you.

606
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,839
I'm only tasting it out of courtesy.

607
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,029
Okay, just give it a taste.

608
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,340
Shall I then?

609
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,159
It's kimchi stew.

610
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,829
- You have to put tons of meat...
- You have to put tons of meat in it.

611
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,579
You have to put tons of meat
in for it to taste good.

612
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,520
I did. Eat it.

613
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,109
You're pretty good.

614
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,460
Here, rolled eggs.
You like this.

615
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,749
You've been stalking me, haven't you?
How can you know everything I like?

616
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,509
- You chased me.
- Don't be ridiculous.

617
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:16,120
Don't lie!

618
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,050
Here.

619
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,629
How can I like all these dishes?

620
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,260
You're a pretty good cook.

621
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,220
Whether you're a ghost or human,
that hearty appetite is still the same.

622
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:45,940
It's meat.

623
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:54,580
I don't know what you're up to.

624
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,220
But it won't go your way.

625
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,469
- Hello.
- Goodness, hello.

626
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,340
Hello.

627
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,739
Is Professor Joo Hye Sung in?

628
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,719
He's not here right now.
What brings you here?

629
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,089
I just wanted to say hello.

630
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,509
- When will he return?
- He'll be back in about an hour.

631
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,419
- Should I give him a call?
- No, that's not necessary.

632
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,840
I'll come again.

633
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,209
By any chance... may I use the bathroom?

634
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,689
Of course! The bathroom is downstairs.

635
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,670
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

636

637
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,709
Kim Hyun Ji.

638
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,040
Why is her student ID here?

639
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,469
- You're back, Director.
- You came back early.

640
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,619
Yes, the appointment was canceled.

641
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,800
- Everything's fine?
- Yes.

642
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,059
Ah, Director.

643
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,820
Someone is here to see you.

644
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,969
- Who?
- The monk who came last time.

645
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,300
He's in the bathroom right now.

646
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,130
Goodness... the professor is here.

647
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,360
This is not the bathroom.

648
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:07,440
- I think you're lost.
- No kidding.

649
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,030
I went into the wrong room.

650
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,560
I'm full.

651
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,929
Since I ate all your dishes
for you, I'm going to leave now.

652
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,800
Already? Stay a bit longer.

653
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,359
I'm bored.

654
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,029
I wish I could, but visiting
hours are almost over.

655
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,210
See you. Hand me my crutches.

656
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,460
Hey!

657
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:01,580
- I'll walk you to your room.
- It's fine. I can do it myself.

658
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,610
- I'll walk you to your room.
- I said it's fine!

659
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,420
What the heck are you doing?

660
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,069
You were falling.

661
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:23,010
We almost kissed!
I haven't had my first kiss yet.

662
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,290
That's... not true.

663
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,500
Then...

664
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,150
You pervert!

665
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,989
Hey, hey, hey!

666
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,759
Do you want to die?

667
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,459
Ow!

668
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,699
Hey!

669
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,330
My first kiss what?
I told you not to mess around with me!

670
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,190
Ow! Ow! Ow!

671
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,120
Jerk.

672
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,200
She's good at fighting.

673
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,970
It feels good to hit him.

674
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,889
Where have you been?

675
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,609
- I went for a short walk.
- Let's go in.

676
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:34,089
- Thank you.
- Be careful when you walk.

677
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:35,630
I will.

678
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,480
The professor is off today,
so I came in his place.

679
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,269
- Are you comfortable.
- Yes.

680
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,639
Oh, I don't see
Doctor Kim Jung Woo either.

681
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,649
Pardon? Who?

682
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,090
Doctor Kim Jung Woo.
You know, the really tall guy.

683
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:56,530
We don't have a doctor by that name.

684
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,039
- Rest up then.
- Thank you.

685
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,740
Rest up.

686
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:13,330
My cell phone.

687
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,040
I must've dropped it on the roof.

688
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,280
She's so clumsy.

689
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,299
Kim Jung Woo.

690
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,990
Kim Jung Woo?
I've heard that name somewhere.

691
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,930
Do you know a Kim Jung Woo?

692
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,560
Kim Jung Woo?

693
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,799
He used to work at our hospital.

694
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,140
You know him?

695
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:30,609
You don't know him?

696
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:36,640
About 10 years ago,
that doctor died in our hospital.

697
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:49,939
<i>That doctor killed a patient
in the operating room.</i>

698
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,289
<i>Not only in our hospital, but also
in the previous hospital where he worked.</i>

699
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,940
<i>He killed patients during surgery.</i>
