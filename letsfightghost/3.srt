00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,131
<font color="yellow">So... did something pop up? You said
your memories would return if we kissed.</font>

5
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,849
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Yeah?</font>

6
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:06,527
<font color="yellow">Anyway, since I did you a favor,
I need you to do me a favor too.</font>

7
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,599
<font color="yellow">It's nothing difficult.</font>

8
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,298
<font color="yellow">Just help me out like you did today.</font>

9
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:14,798
<font color="yellow">I noticed earlier that
you're quite useful.</font>

10
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,578
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you listening to me?</font>

11
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,254
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Yes.</font>

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,795
<font color="yellow">If you help me with the exorcisms, I'll
overlook the 10 million won you owe me.</font>

13
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,420
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

14
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,300
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you going? Hey!</font>

17
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,302
<font color="yellow">Did she just run away?</font>

18
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:49,170
<font color="yellow">What if her memories
returning was all a lie?</font>

19

00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,150
<font color="yellow">I'm so freaking tired.</font>

24
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,754
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

25
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:05,571
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you going? Hey!</font>

26
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:10,287
<font color="yellow">You're an idiot for
listening to a ghost.</font>

27
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:13,309
<font color="yellow">It's not the first time a virgin
ghost played you like that.</font>

28
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:15,607
<font color="yellow">I'm so angry.</font>

29
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:29,199
<font color="yellow">Let's see here.</font>

30
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:31,985
<font color="yellow">I totally forgot to buy groceries.</font>

31
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,581
<font color="yellow">It's all because of that crazy ghost.</font>

32
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:00,773
<font color="yellow">Seriously though, where
did Monk Myung Chul go?</font>

33
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,660
<font color="yellow">She's really nowhere in sight.</font>

34
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,201
<font color="yellow">Fine, I better not catch you.</font>

35
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,814
<font color="yellow">You're still here.</font>

36
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:05,300
<font color="yellow">Just where is my honey?</font>

37
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,590
<font color="yellow">I know for a fact it's this school.</font>

38
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:12,377
<font color="yellow">Honey! Honey! Honey, Honey! Honey!</font>

39
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:16,115
<font color="yellow">Where are you, honey? Honey!</font>

40
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:32,254
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Hyun Ji.
- Where have you been?</font>

41
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:34,119
<font color="yellow">- Finding my honey.
- "My honey"?</font>

42
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:35,268
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

43
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,585
<font color="yellow">It's been 30 years and I finally
found the man of my dreams.</font>

44
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:41,138
<font color="yellow">I'm only going to follow him now.</font>

45
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,449
<font color="yellow">You changed guys again?</font>

46
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:44,689
<font color="yellow">You said that other guy was the
man of your dreams last time.</font>

47
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:48,165
<font color="yellow">It's the real deal this time.</font>

48
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:52,513
<font color="yellow">He's so tall and handsome.</font>

49
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:55,386
<font color="yellow"><i>He was looking straight at
me with those dewy eyes of his.</i></font>

50
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:57,025
<font color="yellow"><i>I got butterflies in my stomach.</i></font>

51
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,547
<font color="yellow">Plus, he's pretty broad-shouldered.</font>

52
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,653
<font color="yellow">He's perfect to cling on to.</font>

53
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,763
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

54
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,929
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

55
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,547
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

56
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,900
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

57
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:20,018
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

58
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:25,749
<font color="yellow">So, it wasn't a soft and squishy
blood sausage, but that guy's lips?</font>

59
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,615
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

60
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:31,122
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! I'm so jealous!</font>

61
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:34,932
<font color="yellow">No, wait. So you kissed
that guy again, right?</font>

62
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,754
<font color="yellow">Did you remember anything?</font>

63
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,833
<font color="yellow">- No. Nothing!
- Nothing?</font>

64
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,288
<font color="yellow">- Absolutely nothing?
- Yes!</font>

65
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,155
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened! Some
memories came back for sure last time.</font>

66
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,233
<font color="yellow">How strange.</font>

67
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,723
<font color="yellow">What should I do, Kyung Ja?</font>

68
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,376
<font color="yellow">Whom are you looking for?</font>

69
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,554
<font color="yellow">Were you looking for me?</font>

70
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:21,337
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's been a day since we've seen
each other. Aren't you happy to see me?</font>

71
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:23,625
<font color="yellow">I'm very happy to see you.</font>

72
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:29,438
<font color="yellow">- Come on, you're scaring me.
- "Come on"?</font>

73
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,800
<font color="yellow">You really don't know?</font>

74
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,800
<font color="yellow">You're shameless, selfish,
and arrogant to boot.</font>

75
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,722
<font color="yellow">Forget it. What would I
talk about with a ghost?</font>

76
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,596
<font color="yellow"><i>Just stick to him
like glue no matter what.</i></font>

77
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:50,142
<font color="yellow">Who knows? Your memories
might come back again.</font>

78
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:51,765
<font color="yellow">You said he's an elite
college student, right?</font>

79
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:55,750
<font color="yellow">Then ask him to help you with
your SATs. Do everything you can.</font>

80
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:59,659
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty sure he's got something.</font>

81
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:04,000
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, wait for me!</font>

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal! Bong, Bong!</font>

83
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:10,569
<font color="yellow">- How are you?
- Hello, Professor.</font>

84
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,370
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here?
- Well... Professor.</font>

85
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:18,622
<font color="yellow">About the dog you saved last time.</font>

86
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,021
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- May I take care of it?</font>

87
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:26,054
<font color="yellow">Of course. That's perfect.
He hasn't met an owner yet.</font>

88
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:29,746
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I saw him on the way here
and I can't stop thinking about him.</font>

89
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:31,328
<font color="yellow">Ah, I see.</font>

90
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,905
<font color="yellow">Can you come after class, then?</font>

91
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,295
<font color="yellow">- Around three o'clock should be good.
- Yes, thank you.</font>

92
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:40,900
<font color="yellow">It's a very happy day for him today.</font>

93
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,569
<font color="yellow">I'm already looking forward to it.</font>

94
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,719
<font color="yellow"><i>Say goodbye to love.</i></font>

95
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:55,300
<font color="yellow"><i>You're back with me again.</i></font>

96
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,131
<font color="yellow">Hey, have you decided
not to speak to me?</font>

97
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:02,914
<font color="yellow">I will help you.</font>

98
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:13,723
<font color="yellow">Answer me!</font>

99
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:15,799
<font color="yellow">- Hand it over.
- Will you forgive me if I do?</font>

100
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,180
<font color="yellow">- I said hand it over.
- No.</font>

101
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,543
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait for me.</font>

102
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,221
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep following me?</font>

103
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:36,053
<font color="yellow">I said I'll help you
get rid of the ghosts.</font>

104
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:37,960
<font color="yellow">Do you honestly believe
I'll trust a ghost's word again?</font>

105
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:40,774
<font color="yellow">Why not? I'm very trustworthy.</font>

106
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:45,349
<font color="yellow">You're lying about your memories.
I know exactly what you're up to!</font>

107
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:47,724
<font color="yellow">- I'm not lying!
- What is it, then?</font>

108
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,506
<font color="yellow">What about your memories?
Did they come back?</font>

109
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:54,376
<font color="yellow">- No... they haven't.
- See?</font>

110
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:56,876
<font color="yellow">I was told not to believe
the words of a virgin ghost.</font>

111
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:02,016
<font color="yellow">My memories popped up last
time, but not this time.</font>

112
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:06,007
<font color="yellow">That's why I did what I did. I'm not
being sneaky, so please believe me.</font>

113
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:08,901
<font color="yellow">- You're going to believe me, right?
- Then what?</font>

114
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,650
<font color="yellow">Your memories haven't returned,
so why are you agreeing to help me?</font>

115
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:18,468
<font color="yellow">Well... I was wondering if you
can help me study for my SAT exam.</font>

116
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,050
<font color="yellow">- SATs?
- Yes.</font>

117
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,900
<font color="yellow">You have to be pretty
smart to attend this school.</font>

118
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,796
<font color="yellow">Why would a ghost study for the SATs?</font>

119
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:32,175
<font color="yellow">I don't remember, but I think I can't
cross over because I didn't take them.</font>

120
00:11:32,176 --> 00:11:35,421
<font color="yellow">I can't help but think that maybe I'll be
able to leave if I do well on my exams.</font>

121
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:42,842
<font color="yellow">Please help me.
It's not hard to do.</font>

122
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,852
<font color="yellow">If you help me study, I'll pay
back the 10 million won I owe you.</font>

123
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:50,775
<font color="yellow">Two million won per exorcism!
What do you think? A great idea, right?</font>

124
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,690
<font color="yellow">It's one million won per ghost.</font>

125
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,096
<font color="yellow">Then, 800,000 won?</font>

126
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:01,045
<font color="yellow">500,000 won per ghost.
Take it or leave it.</font>

127
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:05,195
<font color="yellow">I'll take it!
500,000 won per ghost it is!</font>

128
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:07,500
<font color="yellow">Wait for me!</font>

129
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,395
<font color="yellow">- Chun Sang, aren't you going to class?
- No, I'm not going.</font>

130
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,049
<font color="yellow">Class is not important right now.
This punk is kicking my butt.</font>

131
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:18,631
<font color="yellow">You've been at this since last night.
Give it a rest.</font>

132
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:22,574
<font color="yellow">Nothing good will come out of it if
you keep messing with Sadako. He's evil.</font>

133
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,126
<font color="yellow">You said he emptied out
your account several days ago.</font>

134
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:27,256
<font color="yellow">Yes, he did. He bled me dry.</font>

135
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:30,459
<font color="yellow">You call yourself my friend, yet you
have no loyalty and refuse to help me.</font>

136
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,984
<font color="yellow">Just go and get your scholarship.</font>

137
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:37,194
<font color="yellow">This Sadako needs
a taste of his own medicine.</font>

138
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:40,806
<font color="yellow">He talked crap about me on the live
broadcast and now he's bullying me here!</font>

139
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,160
<font color="yellow">How dare he touch my pride!
You're so dead.</font>

140
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:47,771
<font color="yellow">And he's the one who
uploaded that video!</font>

141
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:56,628
<font color="yellow">Die, Sadako!</font>

142
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:15,587
<font color="yellow">It used to be buy one get one
free. The promotion must be over.</font>

143
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,948
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

144
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:23,849
<font color="yellow">It's a toothbrush.</font>

145
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:26,010
<font color="yellow">I know that, but why
are you putting it in here?</font>

146
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:28,530
<font color="yellow">Because I need one
if we're going to be together.</font>

147
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:31,142
<font color="yellow">Who said I'm going to
spend time with you?</font>

148
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,194
<font color="yellow">- Put it back immediately.
- Why? We're a team now.</font>

149
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:36,452
<font color="yellow">Some teams live together.
It's no big deal.</font>

150
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,109
<font color="yellow">I don't live with ghosts, okay?</font>

151
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,709
<font color="yellow">So you want me to go back and forth
slaying ghosts and studying?</font>

152
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:44,813
<font color="yellow">It's more comfortable sticking
together, don't you think?</font>

153
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,544
<font color="yellow">The truth is, I have no place to go.</font>

154
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:52,497
<font color="yellow">Please! Please? Please?</font>

155
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:57,895
<font color="yellow">Then including room and board...
it's 250,000 won per ghost.</font>

156
00:13:57,896 --> 00:13:59,828
<font color="yellow">250,000...</font>

157
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:02,878
<font color="yellow">I'll never be able to pay
back the 10 million won!</font>

158
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,848
<font color="yellow">- Forget it then.
- Okay, okay! Deal.</font>

159
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,899
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me.
- Yes?</font>

160
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,793
<font color="yellow">I'd like a mackerel, please.</font>

161
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:29,450
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you. Have a good day.</font>

162
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:38,163
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, let's eat meat.</font>

163
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:43,168
<font color="yellow">Meat! Meat! Meat!</font>

164
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:45,482
<font color="yellow">Meat, my butt.</font>

165
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:49,144
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since I ate meat.
We can use this to make some stew.</font>

166
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:50,245
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

167
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:55,189
<font color="yellow">- I said no.
- I want it.</font>

168
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,670
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

169
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,934
<font color="yellow">We're not eating meat!</font>

170
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,906
<font color="yellow">- Let go.
- No.</font>

171
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,149
<font color="yellow">I said let go!</font>

172
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,199
<font color="yellow">Meat. Delicious meat.</font>

173
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,741
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat a lot of meat.</font>

174
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:38,434
<font color="yellow">Are you happy? Because of you,
I'm overspending on living expenses!</font>

175
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,434
<font color="yellow">You're going to eat it too.</font>

176
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:42,966
<font color="yellow">Hey! Bong Pal!</font>

177
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,569
<font color="yellow">Can you buy me that dress?</font>

178
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,503
<font color="yellow">To celebrate working together.</font>

179
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,990
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

180
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,747
<font color="yellow">I know that dress will look really
good on me. Don't you think so?</font>

181
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,099
<font color="yellow">No, I do not think so.
It won't look good on you at all.</font>

182
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:59,591
<font color="yellow">No, look carefully.</font>

183
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,429
<font color="yellow">What do you think?
It's pretty, isn't it?</font>

184
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,675
<font color="yellow">Buy me this dress!</font>

185
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,603
<font color="yellow">He's always negative like that.</font>

186
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:30,009
<font color="yellow">Wait for me!</font>

187
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,370
<font color="yellow">His eyesight is not that great.</font>

188
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,456
<font color="yellow">You'll have to bring him in at
least once a week for the time being.</font>

189
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,404
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Hold on.</font>

190
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,575
<font color="yellow">Okay.
Once in the morning and evening...</font>

191
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,599
<font color="yellow">Here, give this to him in
the morning and evening.</font>

192
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,599
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

193
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:56,162
<font color="yellow">It's time to say goodbye now.</font>

194
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:58,147
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

195
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:00,191
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
<font color="yellow"><i>[Ju Hye Sung]</i></font>

197
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,081
<font color="yellow">- Here.
- Thank you.</font>

198
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,142
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead and hold him.
- Come here.</font>

199
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,688
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Is he adorable?</font>

200
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,690
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

201
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,117
<font color="yellow">Why do girls like that
always flock to the director?</font>

202
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,399
<font color="yellow">- She is disgustingly pretty.
- Hey!</font>

203
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,106
<font color="yellow">One-sided loves are always sad.</font>

204
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,723
<font color="yellow">Should we go grab
some drinks after work?</font>

205
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:25,989
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

206
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,704
<font color="yellow">- It's your treat, right?
- Me?</font>

207
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:33,317
<font color="yellow"><i>[You have attacked Sadako.]

00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,638
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang?</font>

210
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,734
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Are you okay?</font>

211
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:54,319
<font color="yellow">- Lara is dead.
- Lara...</font>

212
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,401
<font color="yellow">She died without even using her magic.</font>

213
00:17:57,402 --> 00:18:00,148
<font color="yellow">- Sadako, that bastard.
- I see.</font>

214
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:12,376
<font color="yellow"><i>It was fun, dumbass.</i></font>

215
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:13,800

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,665
<font color="yellow"><i>Is your little sidekick helping you?</i></font>

You're crossing the line.</i></font>

218
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:25,052
<font color="yellow"><i>Look at you. You're just asking for it.</i></font>

219
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,238
<font color="yellow"><i>It's the same as your live broadcast.</i></font>

220
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,239
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

221
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,752
<font color="yellow"><i>Why? Are you going to come?
Come and find me.</i></font>

222
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:33,490
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't mess with me from now on.</i></font>

224
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:39,126
<font color="yellow"><i>Or is it both?</i></font>

225
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:48,899
<font color="yellow"><i>Famous singer Miz has

she left a video of it.</i></font>

227
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:07,963
<font color="yellow">What the heck?</font>

228
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,482
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

229
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,511
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

230
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:46,198
<font color="yellow">Don't come near me!</font>

231
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:12,684
<font color="yellow">Would it have killed
you to buy me that dress?</font>

232
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:16,017
<font color="yellow">I bought you toiletries and meat.
Now you want a dress?</font>

233
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:19,599
<font color="yellow">Do you take me for a fool?</font>

234
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,780
<font color="yellow">It's not that. Look at this.</font>

235
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,722
<font color="yellow">My uniform is all worn out
from wearing it for five years.</font>

236
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:30,180
<font color="yellow">Then what about the ghosts that
have been dead for over 100 years, huh?</font>

237
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:32,217
<font color="yellow">Haven't you seen clothes
of virgin ghosts up close?</font>

238
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:34,771
<font color="yellow">It's really dirty and it stinks.</font>

239
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:36,798
<font color="yellow">Ghosts shouldn't be
complaining about their clothes.</font>

240
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,931
<font color="yellow">Can you even wear it
if I buy it for you?</font>

241
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,688
<font color="yellow">Of course! You just have to burn it.</font>

242
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,731
<font color="yellow">People usually burn
dead people's clothes.</font>

243
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:45,985
<font color="yellow">- Just buy new clothes and burn them?
- Yes.</font>

244
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:48,899
<font color="yellow">I don't have an endless supply of money.</font>

245
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,893
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- I'm looking at my stuff.</font>

246
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:13,806
<font color="yellow">What's with that look on your face?</font>

247
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:16,323
<font color="yellow">- Why do you look so pleased?
- I'm happy.</font>

248
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:19,425
<font color="yellow">- About what? About that?
- Yes.</font>

249
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:23,058
<font color="yellow">It's been five years since I've
received a present. Of course I'm happy.</font>

250
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,700
<font color="yellow">Oh please.</font>

251
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,728
<font color="yellow">I have no memories, so I can't even
eat food on the anniversary of my death.</font>

252
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:30,481
<font color="yellow">It's my first gift ever since I died.</font>

253
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:32,856
<font color="yellow">Ghosts can even brush their teeth?</font>

254
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,796
<font color="yellow">Why? Are we not allowed to?</font>

255
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:37,092
<font color="yellow">I'm a very hygienic ghost.
What's the matter with you?</font>

256
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:39,460
<font color="yellow">You said
it's your first gift in five years.</font>

257
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:42,099
<font color="yellow">Then it's been five years
since you've brushed your teeth.</font>

258
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,842
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah, you're very hygienic.</font>

259
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,341
<font color="yellow">It tastes better with a lot of meat.
Don't be stingy and put some more in.</font>

260
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:09,416
<font color="yellow">I put in more than enough.
I'm doing all the work here.</font>

261
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,520
<font color="yellow">Stop distracting me and be quiet.</font>

262
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,062
<font color="yellow">It looks so good.</font>

263
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:15,778
<font color="yellow"><i>Bong Pal!</i></font>

264
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,378
<font color="yellow"><i>Bong Pal!</i></font>

265
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:22,363
<font color="yellow"><i>Bong Pal!</i></font>

266
00:22:29,272 --> 00:22:31,136
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

267
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:33,217
<font color="yellow">I had to go find something.</font>

268
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:40,038
<font color="yellow">- Why is that there?
- What?</font>

269
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,715
<font color="yellow">That thing right there! I've been
looking all over for it today!</font>

270
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:49,544
<font color="yellow">- Did you take it?
- Why would I take that?</font>

271
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:52,222
<font color="yellow">- It was here since yesterday.
- Since yesterday?</font>

272
00:22:58,616 --> 00:23:00,875
<font color="yellow">I must be getting weak.</font>

273
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,500
<font color="yellow">That smells delicious. Let's eat.</font>

274
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,626
<font color="yellow">Sure. Please sit.</font>

275
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:20,813
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what's the occasion?
I can't believe you made this.</font>

276
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:24,375
<font color="yellow">- You made this for me, didn't you?
- Dig in.</font>

277
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:32,571
<font color="yellow">Ah, you're a good boy!</font>

278
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:49,579
<font color="yellow">That was good.</font>

279
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,481
<font color="yellow">Oh, my stomach hurts.</font>

280
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:58,695
<font color="yellow">That was tasty.</font>

281
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,115
<font color="yellow">What about the meat?</font>

282
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:05,441
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

283
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:14,868
<font color="yellow">Is that monk always here?</font>

284
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,784
<font color="yellow">Not always.
He's here about twice a month.</font>

285
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:22,899
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

286
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:25,849
<font color="yellow">What's up with this toothbrush?</font>

287
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:27,897
<font color="yellow">That's my toothbrush!</font>

288
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,099
<font color="yellow">Did you buy it for me to use?</font>

289
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,043
<font color="yellow">Of all the colors, why did you pick pink?</font>

290
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:36,037
<font color="yellow">That's mine! What is up with that monk?</font>

291
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,875
<font color="yellow">I'll use it well.</font>

292
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,205
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

293
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:03,097
<font color="yellow">I am so angry!</font>

294
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,200
<font color="yellow">I hope you fall flat on your
face and break your nose.</font>

295
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:22,588
<font color="yellow">Goodness, did I break my arm?</font>

296
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:27,115
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I ate too much.</font>

297
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:40,088
<font color="yellow">Oh, my back.</font>

298
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:46,981
<font color="yellow">Serves you right.</font>

299
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,087
<font color="yellow">By the way, where do I sleep?</font>

300
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,851
<font color="yellow">Why does he always sleep like that?</font>

301
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:12,712
<font color="yellow">It's nice and soft.</font>

302
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:21,325
<font color="yellow">How comfortable. How long has it
been since I've slept on a bed?</font>

303
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:57,279
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bong Pal.</font>

304
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,665
<font color="yellow">Why did you sleep out here
instead of your room?</font>

305
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:04,856
<font color="yellow">It was hot.</font>

306
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:08,186
<font color="yellow">If you were hot, why did
you hold me last night?</font>

307
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:09,953
<font color="yellow">I did not!</font>

308
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:15,927
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

309
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:21,889
<font color="yellow">Did you... did you
miss being in my arms?</font>

310
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,318
<font color="yellow">Come on! Seriously!</font>

311
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:31,953
<font color="yellow">People should definitely live together.</font>

312
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:49,800
<font color="yellow">Where are you going without breakfast?</font>

313
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,831
<font color="yellow">I have business to
take care of in Leechun.</font>

314
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,960
<font color="yellow">Make sure you eat well. I'll see
you on your mother's memorial day.</font>

315
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,520
<font color="yellow">- His mother's memorial day?
- And Bong Pal.</font>

316
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:01,009
<font color="yellow">Don't go around exorcising ghosts.</font>

317
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,474
<font color="yellow">And don't get close to virgin ghosts.
They're nothing but trouble.</font>

318
00:30:06,475 --> 00:30:09,081
<font color="yellow">They're monsters, got it?</font>

319
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:10,837
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

320
00:30:10,837 --> 00:30:12,990
<font color="yellow">Don't just tell me
that you understand, huh?</font>

321
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,046
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

322
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,792
<font color="yellow">I feel an energy in this place.</font>

323
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:23,844
<font color="yellow">Do you see anything?</font>

324
00:30:25,002 --> 00:30:27,377
<font color="yellow">No, I don't see anything.</font>

325
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,492
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself.
I'm leaving.</font>

326
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,808
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- All right.</font>

327
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:41,249
<font color="yellow">Does he think that all ghosts are evil?</font>

328
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:43,510
<font color="yellow">There are so many nice ghosts
like myself out there.</font>

329
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,485
<font color="yellow">I don't like him at all.
He's quick to pass judgment.</font>

330
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:49,312
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal. When are we going to eat?</font>

331
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,013
<font color="yellow">Do you always ask about food
the moment you wake up?</font>

332
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:15,716
<font color="yellow">Hey. Let's redo our contract.</font>

333
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:17,337
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

334
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:19,173
<font color="yellow">I said I'd provide
accommodation and food.</font>

335
00:31:19,173 --> 00:31:21,853
<font color="yellow">But seeing you eat,
I won't be able to afford this.</font>

336
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:23,042
<font color="yellow">- So...
- So?</font>

337
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:25,183
<font color="yellow">Let's change to 20 or 25 per exorcism.</font>

338
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,772
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

339
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:28,512
<font color="yellow">How much can I possibly eat?</font>

340
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,572
<font color="yellow">As you can see, this is what's left.</font>

341
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:34,032
<font color="yellow">I had food that would last for a week.</font>

342
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:36,032
<font color="yellow">How could you eat half of it in one day?</font>

343
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:38,052
<font color="yellow">This is too much.</font>

344
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:46,552
<font color="yellow">I didn't eat that much.</font>

345
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:48,792
<font color="yellow">You ate a lot.</font>

346
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,463
<font color="yellow">It's so petty to neg about food.</font>

347
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:55,782
<font color="yellow">I can exorcise better when I'm fed well.</font>

348
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:58,113
<font color="yellow">You haven't even started working yet.</font>

349
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:02,062
<font color="yellow">What? If you don't like it,
we can forget the whole thing.</font>

350
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:04,153
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how petty.</font>

351
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:06,042
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you like!
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

352
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,703
<font color="yellow">Give me more.</font>

353
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,792
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

354
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,742
<font color="yellow">I'm so full now.</font>

355
00:32:26,742 --> 00:32:28,562
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

356
00:32:29,703 --> 00:32:32,012
<font color="yellow">- Why do you ask?
- So I can come with you.</font>

357
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:33,213
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

358
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:34,603
<font color="yellow">Even if we live together</font>

359
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:37,582
<font color="yellow">let's not get involved in
each other's private lives, okay?</font>

360
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,482
<font color="yellow">I will slap this Sadako, such a psycho!</font>

361
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:53,363
<font color="yellow">I will slap him once or twice...</font>

362
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,512
<font color="yellow">- I will end him, seriously.
- This is the place.</font>

363
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:01,963
<font color="yellow">His address is in this dorm
for people studying for civil exams.</font>

364
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:04,103
<font color="yellow">But is it okay to just come by like this?</font>

365
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:07,363
<font color="yellow">According to the rumors,
he knows martial arts.</font>

366
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,463
<font color="yellow">That's all bullshit, okay?</font>

367
00:33:11,463 --> 00:33:14,842
<font color="yellow">I will seriously slap him.</font>

368
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:17,522
<font color="yellow">It's room 307... 307.</font>

369
00:33:17,522 --> 00:33:20,082
<font color="yellow">3 and wait.</font>

370
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,153
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, I'm here.</font>

371
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:28,413
<font color="yellow">Sadako, Black Star Angel is here.</font>

372
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,322
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

373
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:33,252
<font color="yellow">He's scared, huh?</font>

374
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:36,783
<font color="yellow">Come on, seriously...</font>

375
00:33:44,162 --> 00:33:46,352
<font color="yellow">Get out! Get out!</font>

376
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:05,463
<font color="yellow">He was notorious for writing
nasty comments on social media sites.</font>

377
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:07,903
<font color="yellow">He's been sued a lot.</font>

378
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:10,613
<font color="yellow">Also he was sued by the singer Miz.</font>

379
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,743
<font color="yellow">- The idol singer who killed herself?
- Yes.</font>

380
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,283
<font color="yellow">- Who are they?
- They're the ones who called the police.</font>

381
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:21,722
<font color="yellow">They found him
when they came to fight him.</font>

382
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:25,653
<font color="yellow">They came to have
a real fight from a game?</font>

383
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,763
<font color="yellow"><i>You go to Myungsung University, huh?</i></font>

384
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:39,300
<font color="yellow">I see many students
from there these days.</font>

385
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,403
<font color="yellow">The punk from last time
went to Myungsung too.</font>

386
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:45,832
<font color="yellow">So you got his ID
and hacked his account, huh?</font>

387
00:34:45,832 --> 00:34:48,443
<font color="yellow">You got mad while chatting
with him and came here, huh?</font>

388
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,182
<font color="yellow">Correct.</font>

389
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:51,772
<font color="yellow">You were mad, so you killed him, huh?</font>

390
00:34:51,772 --> 00:34:53,832
<font color="yellow">- Correct.
- What?</font>

391
00:34:53,832 --> 00:34:56,613
<font color="yellow">No way! He was already dead
when we got there.</font>

392
00:34:56,642 --> 00:35:00,472
<font color="yellow">- That's the truth. Correct?
- Correct. We didn't do anything.</font>

393
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:03,752
<font color="yellow">- Seriously?
- Yes.</font>

394
00:35:04,272 --> 00:35:06,883
<font color="yellow">We checked the CCTVs near his place.</font>

395
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:09,843
<font color="yellow">Like they say,
they got there after he died.</font>

396
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:11,843
<font color="yellow">Their identification
has been checked too.</font>

397
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:16,472
<font color="yellow">- But you might want to see this.
- What's all this?</font>

398
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:19,013
<font color="yellow">All the nasty comments
made against the late Miz.</font>

399
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:20,283
<font color="yellow">They are so many.</font>

400
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,283
<font color="yellow">They're only for this month.</font>

401
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:24,383
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

402
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:30,022
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's all curse words here.</font>

403
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:32,533
<font color="yellow">Words can hurt more, you know.</font>

404
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:36,982
<font color="yellow">Who would want to live
after hearing such horrible things?</font>

405
00:35:38,343 --> 00:35:40,062
<font color="yellow">What did you want me to see?</font>

406
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:42,472
<font color="yellow">The screen names of those
who wrote nasty comments...</font>

407
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:45,432
<font color="yellow">The one who wrote most is Sadako.</font>

408
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:47,343
<font color="yellow">It's the screen name
of Yang Hee Soo, who died today.</font>

409
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:51,222
<font color="yellow">The leader of the anti-fan group,
Kim Kyung Ho, wrote second most.</font>

410
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:53,903
<font color="yellow">I just heard from the Gangsuh police
that he also died.</font>

411
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:57,033
<font color="yellow">His fingers were all broken,
like Yang Hee Soo's.</font>

412
00:35:57,033 --> 00:36:00,022
<font color="yellow">The third person
who wrote the most is Jikdding.</font>

413
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:03,653
<font color="yellow">And look at this screen name.</font>

414
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:08,892
<font color="yellow">How do you say this?</font>

415
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:11,303
<font color="yellow">Black star BJ 1004?</font>

416
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,443
<font color="yellow">It is Black Star BJ Angel.</font>

417
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:17,392
<font color="yellow">It's my screen name.</font>

418
00:36:19,082 --> 00:36:24,403
<font color="yellow">- You wrote a lot of nasty comments.
- No, it's just like I said earlier...</font>

419
00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:27,412
<font color="yellow">My account was hacked,
and Sadako wrote all that.</font>

420
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:29,792
<font color="yellow">I didn't write them. I'm serious.</font>

00:37:40,702 --> 00:37:44,582
<font color="yellow">I liked Miz so much.
What am I going to do?</font>

443
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:47,562
<font color="yellow">Will her ghost come to me?</font>

444
00:37:47,562 --> 00:37:49,452
<font color="yellow">It's ridiculous.</font>

445
00:37:52,662 --> 00:37:55,713
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Chul Sung, I need to go to my hometown.</font>

446
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:58,002
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Your hometown is Seoul.</font>

447
00:37:58,002 --> 00:37:59,573
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought,
but it turns out it's not.</font>

448
00:37:59,573 --> 00:38:01,113
<font color="yellow">I asked my mom.</font>

449
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:05,283
<font color="yellow">It's all the way down in
Gyungsang Namdo, Jaechun.</font>

450
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,392
<font color="yellow">- It's Jaechun.
- Jaechun is in Chungbook.</font>

451
00:38:07,392 --> 00:38:10,602
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting this way
when I'm scared to death?</font>

452
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:16,292
<font color="yellow">- What is that?
- What is that?</font>

453
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:33,993
<font color="yellow"><i>Crazy bitch.</i></font>

454
00:38:33,993 --> 00:38:36,852
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you still want to get
criticized after you're dead?</i></font>

455
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:28,002
<font color="yellow">Did you have to follow me to school?</font>

456
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:30,213
<font color="yellow">Why not? It's fun.</font>

457
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:33,713
<font color="yellow">I don't go to school
to make it fun for you.</font>

458
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:36,502
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry about me.</font>

459
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:43,702
<font color="yellow">Besides, I may never get to
become a college student.</font>

460
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:46,912
<font color="yellow">- Don't you feel sorry for me?
- Only if you can shut up.</font>

461
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,222
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to her. Do not.</font>

462
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:51,613
<font color="yellow">You're all about talk.</font>

463
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:53,752
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

464
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,993
<font color="yellow">Why is the lecture so long?</font>

465
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:04,993
<font color="yellow">I'm starving.</font>

466
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:07,542
<font color="yellow">Can we go eat first?</font>

467
00:40:07,843 --> 00:40:10,903
<font color="yellow">Did you die of hunger or something?
Why are you always hungry?</font>

468
00:40:12,263 --> 00:40:15,100
<font color="yellow">Did I die of hunger?</font>

469
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,182
<font color="yellow">Wait. It's that girl.</font>

470
00:40:20,122 --> 00:40:22,783
<font color="yellow">Oh my, you're so happy, huh?</font>

471
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:27,082
<font color="yellow">Don't just look at her.
Go over and ask her to lunch.</font>

472
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:29,883
<font color="yellow">What lunch? Let's go.</font>

473
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:33,213
<font color="yellow">- Ouch! Hey!
- Bong Pal.</font>

474
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:40,702
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

475
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:42,443
<font color="yellow">Come on. Ask her to lunch.</font>

476
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:44,722
<font color="yellow">Hi. You're done with class?</font>

477
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,932
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I am.
- "Yes, I am"?</font>

478
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:50,142
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what kind of man are you?</font>

479
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:53,622
<font color="yellow">- All right then. I will go first.
- Wait, Senior.</font>

480
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:55,482
<font color="yellow">There you go. You're doing well.</font>

481
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:59,963
<font color="yellow">- It's just that...
- Hurry up and say it.</font>

482
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,803
<font color="yellow">- About lunch...
- What about lunch?</font>

483
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:08,562
<font color="yellow">I wanted to say enjoy lunch.</font>

484
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:11,323
<font color="yellow">Oh, you do the same.</font>

485
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:14,122
<font color="yellow">- See you later then.
- Sure.</font>

486
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:18,472
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what was that about?</font>

487
00:41:20,693 --> 00:41:23,153
<font color="yellow">"I wanted to say enjoy lunch."</font>

488
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:27,943
<font color="yellow">Can you ever date anyone like that?</font>

489
00:41:28,993 --> 00:41:30,903
<font color="yellow">- Hush.
- Hush.</font>

490
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:32,522
<font color="yellow">- Don't repeat what I say.
- Don't repeat what I say.</font>

491
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:34,452
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to die?
- I'm already dead.</font>

492
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:40,122
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey!</font>

493
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,573
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo.</font>

494
00:41:46,363 --> 00:41:48,573
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Seo Yeon.
- How are you?</font>

495
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,412
<font color="yellow">- How is the dog doing?
- Good.</font>

496
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:54,162
<font color="yellow">He's doing well,
but he doesn't eat much.</font>

497
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:56,162
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

498
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:59,613
<font color="yellow">It may be because
he's not used to where he is.</font>

499
00:41:59,613 --> 00:42:01,613
<font color="yellow">If you're worried,
bring him over to the clinic.</font>

500
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,332
<font color="yellow">Thank you. When will be
a good time for you?</font>

501
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:07,062
<font color="yellow">Well, any time in the afternoon
either today or tomorrow.</font>

502
00:42:07,062 --> 00:42:09,673
<font color="yellow">Great.
I will bring him over tomorrow then.</font>

503
00:42:09,673 --> 00:42:11,963
<font color="yellow">All right then. I will see you tomorrow.</font>

504
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,852
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to feed a cat here.</font>

505
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:40,573
<font color="yellow">I've been wondering
who was feeding the cat every day.</font>

506
00:42:40,573 --> 00:42:42,932
<font color="yellow">We meet finally.</font>

507
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:44,993
<font color="yellow">Hello, Professor Joo.</font>

508
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,323
<font color="yellow">The building for animal research is here.</font>

509
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:50,832
<font color="yellow">We're strict about wild animals.</font>

510
00:42:50,832 --> 00:42:53,073
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't feed
the wild animals like this.</font>

511
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:56,182
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. The cat looked so hungry.</font>

512
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:59,852
<font color="yellow">Then feed the cat
at that corner next time.</font>

513
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:01,542
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

514
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:05,153
<font color="yellow">The security guard comes by here often,
so you will get caught.</font>

515
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:07,763
<font color="yellow">If you do that at the corner there,
no one will know.</font>

516
00:43:07,763 --> 00:43:10,323
<font color="yellow">- Not many people go there.
- Okay.</font>

517
00:43:10,743 --> 00:43:12,263
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

518
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:15,812
<font color="yellow">By the way,
it looks like it just gave birth.</font>

519
00:43:15,812 --> 00:43:18,122
<font color="yellow">I saw kittens nearby too.</font>

520
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,173
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's good for
a cat who just gave birth?</font>

521
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:26,522
<font color="yellow">Well, they will like
shredded chicken breast or beef.</font>

522
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:30,622
<font color="yellow">But I will have
to examine it to be sure...</font>

523
00:43:30,622 --> 00:43:32,062
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

524
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:38,033
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

525
00:43:39,102 --> 00:43:41,432
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm okay.</font>

526
00:43:41,432 --> 00:43:43,403
<font color="yellow">It was vicious.</font>

527
00:43:44,993 --> 00:43:48,153
<font color="yellow"><i>[Rest in Peace]</i></font>

528
00:44:08,432 --> 00:44:11,193
<font color="yellow">Why is this so confusing, seriously?</font>

529
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:13,102
<font color="yellow">Here we go again.</font>

530
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:23,642
<font color="yellow">It's all the will of Buddha.</font>

531
00:44:23,642 --> 00:44:24,642
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

532
00:44:32,443 --> 00:44:34,472
<font color="yellow">I will start.</font>

533
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:29,903
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

534
00:45:29,903 --> 00:45:33,352
<font color="yellow">Buddhist prayer
is very modern these days.</font>

535
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:40,832
<font color="yellow">Let me take this call. Excuse me.</font>

536
00:45:40,832 --> 00:45:44,763
<font color="yellow">What lousy timing, seriously.</font>

537
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,042
<font color="yellow">Hello. Hold on a minute.</font>

538
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:51,573
<font color="yellow">Hold on a minute, okay?</font>

539
00:45:54,553 --> 00:45:56,843
<font color="yellow">Park Ji Hoon,
34 Gyungwha Ro, Yang Joo Eup.</font>

540
00:45:56,843 --> 00:45:59,923
<font color="yellow">Yang Joo Gun, Gwangwon Do.</font>

541
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:04,743
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm asking you
because I can't be there.</font>

542
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:07,300
<font color="yellow">It's near your place.</font>

543
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,113
<font color="yellow">Go there and see what he's up to.</font>

544
00:46:10,113 --> 00:46:12,403
<font color="yellow">I can't get in touch with him.</font>

545
00:46:13,843 --> 00:46:17,323
<font color="yellow">He's Bong Pal's father.</font>

546
00:46:17,323 --> 00:46:21,573
<font color="yellow">All right then.</font>

547
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:39,943
<font color="yellow">It's not good to have a crush
on someone for too long.</font>

548
00:46:39,943 --> 00:46:42,303
<font color="yellow">Go tell her how you feel.</font>

549
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:44,142
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you being shy?</font>

550
00:46:44,142 --> 00:46:46,403
<font color="yellow">- You want this big sister to help you?
- What big sister?</font>

551
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,403
<font color="yellow">You not doing anything is helping me.</font>

552
00:46:48,403 --> 00:46:52,613
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal! Bong Pal!</font>

553
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:55,673
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Mr. Bong Pal.</font>

554
00:46:56,093 --> 00:47:00,022
<font color="yellow">- I said I wasn't interested in the club.
- That's not it.</font>

555
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:03,202
<font color="yellow">I wonder if you can
help Chun Sang at all.</font>

556
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:08,073
<font color="yellow">God, Buddha,
and gods of heaven and earth.</font>

557
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:17,392
<font color="yellow">Why is Kim In Rang taking so long?</font>

558
00:47:17,392 --> 00:47:20,499
<font color="yellow">It's just that...</font>

559
00:47:20,499 --> 00:47:23,062
<font color="yellow">You know the singer
Miz, right? She died</font>

560
00:47:23,062 --> 00:47:25,352
<font color="yellow">and Chun Sang wrote nasty
comments on the website.</font>

561
00:47:25,352 --> 00:47:28,082
<font color="yellow">No, there is this guy named Sadako.</font>

562
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:32,653
<font color="yellow">Sadako hacked Chun Sang's account.</font>

563
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:36,700
<font color="yellow">So... Chun Sang...</font>

564
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,173
<font color="yellow">It's from Chun Sang.</font>

565
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:41,852
<font color="yellow">Hello? I'm with Bong Pal now.</font>

566
00:47:41,852 --> 00:47:44,932
<font color="yellow">- Are you?
- Chun Sang, hello?</font>

We have to go now.</font>

573
00:48:18,093 --> 00:48:21,073
<font color="yellow">We have to go save him.</font>

574

<font color="yellow">God and Buddha. Please save me.</font>

575
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:04,993
<font color="yellow">Don't!</font>

576
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,513
<font color="yellow">Stop doing this.</font>

577

<font color="yellow">You killing people won't change anything.</font>

578
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,133
<font color="yellow">All I wanted was to get complimented.</font>

579
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,363
<font color="yellow">Why did they have to hate me so much?</font>

580

who hates yourself the most!</font>

<font color="yellow">Killing people won't change anything.</font>

583
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,193
<font color="yellow">How dare you tell me what to do?</font>

584
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:40,193
<font color="yellow">What could you possibly know?</font>

585
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,852
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

586
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:15,852
