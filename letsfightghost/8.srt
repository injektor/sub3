00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,210
<font color="yellow">Something came up.</font>

46

the amusement park some other time.</font>

47
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,449
<font color="yellow">- Fine.
- Did you wait for a long time?</font>

48
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,419
<font color="yellow">No! I just left right away
when you didn't come.</font>

49

you were waiting for me.</font>

you this whole time?</font>

<font color="yellow">Have you seen that person before?</font>

52
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,029
<font color="yellow">He's about 174 centimeters tall
and 44 years old.</font>

53
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,690
<font color="yellow">And his name is Park Ji Hoon.</font>

54
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,200
<font color="yellow">Do you know the boarding house in
Yangjoo Village? He lives there.</font>

55

accidents to occur here.</font>

59
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,550
<font color="yellow">I'll make a report now, so please go to
the back mountains and search the area.</font>

60
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,449
<font color="yellow">What search?</font>

61
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,069
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
I just showed you that picture.</font>

62
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,049
<font color="yellow">This rock is all coated in red!</font>

63
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,589
<font color="yellow">Look how red this rock
is next to the green one!</font>

64
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,719
<font color="yellow">Something happened,
so please go and search the area!</font>

65
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,859
<font color="yellow">That is not going to be of any help.</font>

66
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,809
<font color="yellow">There's not many people in
this precinct to go on a search.</font>

67
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,739
<font color="yellow">Then what are you going to do?
This is bad!</font>

68
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,269
<font color="yellow">Please, that's enough.
If you're that upset, fill this out.</font>

all over the mountains!</font>

done by writing a report!</font>

71
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,370
<font color="yellow">Please don't throw a fit here.
Just fill that report out.</font>

72
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,640

<font color="yellow">Do you know that?</font>

80
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,790
<font color="yellow">That child died
because you didn't tell me.</font>

81
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,140
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

82
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,300
<font color="yellow">If you don't...</font>

83
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,160
<font color="yellow">Your son will die.</font>

84
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,190
<font color="yellow">This is your last chance.</font>

85
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,280
<font color="yellow">Tell me!</font>

86
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,599
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going?
- Where?</font>

87
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,389
<font color="yellow">- To school.
- No, I'm not going.</font>

88
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,790
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stay home.</font>

89
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,890
<font color="yellow">That's a surprise. You always follow me.</font>

90
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,860
<font color="yellow">Do I have to follow you every day?</font>

91
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,070
<font color="yellow">Fine then, stay home.
I'm going to go.</font>

92
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,990
<font color="yellow">That's right, I'm going to stay home!</font>

93
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,170
<font color="yellow">I'm really not good at
this "hard-to-get" thing.</font>

94
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,819
<font color="yellow">I never asked her to follow me.</font>

95
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,049
<font color="yellow">She's the one who's
always tagging along.</font>

96
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,860
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's actually nice
not having her around.</font>

97
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,910
<font color="yellow">You scared me!</font>

98
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,070

- I just got here.</font>

99

<font color="yellow">What are you mumbling to yourself?</font>

100
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,160
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

101
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,840

102
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,149
<font color="yellow">I'm not following you.
I'm going because I want to.</font>

103
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,860
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm sure you are.</font>

104
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,879
<font color="yellow">What is up with that puppy dog smile?
Who are you looking at?</font>

105
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,050
<font color="yellow">This picture is from our retreat.</font>

106
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,690
<font color="yellow">Who is making you smile like that...</font>

107
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,649
<font color="yellow">No. Not... not Seo Yeon.</font>

108
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,149
<font color="yellow">Absolutely no way!
Never ever never!</font>

109
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,120

do if Bong Pal finds out?</font>

110
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,529
<font color="yellow">Are you a weirdo? Huh?
You're being treacherous!</font>

111
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,879
<font color="yellow">- How dare you have feelings for...
- What are you talking about?</font>

112
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,049
<font color="yellow">Why would I have feelings for Seo Yeon?
You're being ridiculous.</font>

113
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,849
<font color="yellow">Then who is it?</font>

114
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,350
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

115
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,570
<font color="yellow">Is it me?</font>

116
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,729
<font color="yellow">Yeah, take me instead.
You can have my body.</font>

117
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,139
<font color="yellow">No! Get away from me!</font>

118
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,020
<font color="yellow">Ow, my nipples.</font>

119
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,140
<font color="yellow">Who is it then?
Is it Bong Pal?</font>

120
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,799
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

121
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,499
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

122
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,559
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, he keeps smiling whenever
he looks at you. He's acting so weird.</font>

123
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,299
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not! That's not true!</font>

124
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,680
<font color="yellow">Who's making you smile then?</font>

125
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,280
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

126
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,310
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

127
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,869
<font color="yellow">Is it a ghost?
Is that a picture of a ghost?</font>

128
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's me!
They got me on camera!</font>

129
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,399
<font color="yellow">My angel.</font>

130
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,459
<font color="yellow">Your angel. An angel?
The angel you saw at the retreat?</font>

131
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,119
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's that angel.</font>

132
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,149
<font color="yellow">He says I'm an angel.</font>

133
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,730
<font color="yellow">Angel, my butt.</font>

134
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,019
<font color="yellow">Right, when I rolled down
the stairs that time...</font>

135
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,020
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for my
angel... I would've... died.</font>

136
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,060
<font color="yellow">At that time the angel asked me...</font>

137
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,720
<font color="yellow">"Are you okay?"</font>

138
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,020
<font color="yellow">She saved me with those
words and stole my heart.</font>

139
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,910
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, I think
he's fallen for me. Right?</font>

140
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,730
<font color="yellow">At that moment...</font>

141
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,559
<font color="yellow">I think you did get a hole
in your head back then.</font>

142
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,059
<font color="yellow">That ghost didn't steal your
heart, she took your wits from you!</font>

143
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,969
<font color="yellow">- Wake up!
- Who cares if it's a ghost!</font>

144
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,050
<font color="yellow">Look!</font>

145
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,140
<font color="yellow">She's so pretty, kind, and cute.</font>

146
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,640
<font color="yellow">- What do you think?
- She's kind?</font>

147
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,160
<font color="yellow">- She looks nice.
- She's cute?</font>

148
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,239
<font color="yellow">I guess I must be pretty.
It was love at first sight.</font>

149
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,169
<font color="yellow">- Right?
- Oh please. Happy?</font>

150
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,850
<font color="yellow">Someone just said they like me.
Wouldn't you be happy about it?</font>

151
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,520
<font color="yellow">Anyway, he is not normal.</font>

152
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,430
<font color="yellow">- Who?
- Who do you think? Senior In Rang.</font>

153
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,369
<font color="yellow">I could understand Chun Sang
because he's naturally weird.</font>

154
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,669
<font color="yellow">But Senior In Rang is weirder.</font>

155
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,029
<font color="yellow">No way, he's not weird at all.</font>

156
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,019
<font color="yellow">That's a natural response
from looking at me.</font>

157
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,609
<font color="yellow">You're the one who is weird.</font>

158
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,190
<font color="yellow">You're a bit overconfident today.</font>

159
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,819
<font color="yellow"><i>She's so pretty, but she's
prettier when she smiles.</i></font>

160
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,520
<font color="yellow"><i>Seriously, she's just
an angel when she smiles.</i></font>

161
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,520
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Hurry up.</font>

162
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,489
<font color="yellow">What's so pretty about her?</font>

163
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,560
<font color="yellow">Senior In Rang is crazy.</font>

164
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,159
<font color="yellow">That girl's arm is injured.</font>

165
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,820
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

166
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,410
<font color="yellow">Hello, Senior.</font>

167
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,979
<font color="yellow">I didn't even say a proper
thank you to you yesterday.</font>

168
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,999
<font color="yellow">I would've had a hard time
if you weren't with me at the hospital.</font>

169
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,119
<font color="yellow">Thanks for staying with me.</font>

170
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,909
<font color="yellow">You said you had a prior engagement.
Were you late because of me?</font>

171
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,260
<font color="yellow">- Ah... yes, well...
- What the heck?</font>

172
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,879
<font color="yellow">He was preoccupied because
he was with that girl.</font>

173
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,090
<font color="yellow">If it's okay with you, I'll treat you
to a meal today. What do you think?</font>

174
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,360
<font color="yellow">- That's okay.
- It's because I'm grateful.</font>

175
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,980
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

176
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,780
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Yes, hello.</font>

177
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,260
<font color="yellow">I have something to say
before we start class.</font>

178
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,570
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there are other students
who already know about this.</font>

179
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,720
<font color="yellow">Your fellow classmate No Hyun Joo
has been in an unfortunate accident.</font>

180
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:13,149
<font color="yellow">Hyun Joo's funeral information
is on the class website.</font>

181
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,110
<font color="yellow">If you know her, it would be nice
if you can make it to her funeral.</font>

182
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:24,709
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll start calling off names now.</font>

183
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,859
<font color="yellow">- Kim Oh Chang.
- Here.</font>

184
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,359
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

185
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,689
<font color="yellow">- Na Jin Soo.
- Here.</font>

186
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,190
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

187
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,400
<font color="yellow">- Park Bong Pal.
- Here.</font>

188
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,070
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

189
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,930
<font color="yellow">Good for you that you're alive.</font>

190
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,930
<font color="yellow">And Bong Pal likes you too.</font>

191
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,759
<font color="yellow">Okay, that's all for today.
Good job, everyone.</font>

192
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,860
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

193
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,550
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, what do you like to eat?
Let's eat what you like.</font>

194
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,649
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Senior,
but let's just call it even.</font>

195
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,110
<font color="yellow">- I have to go home.
- What?</font>

196
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,260
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Sure.</font>

197
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,610
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

198
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,619
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Yes, hello.</font>

199
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,139
<font color="yellow">- Are you heading somewhere?
- Yes, there's a seminar.</font>

200
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,019
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

201
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,079
<font color="yellow">It's nothing really. We forgot to ask you
a question the other day.</font>

202
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,199
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

203
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,950
<font color="yellow">Where were you on the day
No Hyun Joo was murdered?</font>

204
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,150
<font color="yellow">Ah, I have to ask because it's protocol,
so please don't be so concerned.</font>

205
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,979
<font color="yellow">I was at the hospital clinic that day.</font>

206
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,119
<font color="yellow">The hospital clinic?</font>

207
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,419
<font color="yellow">I understand. I apologize for
bothering you when you're so busy.</font>

208
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,580
<font color="yellow">- Not at all. Have a good day.
- Yes, thank you.</font>

209
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,299
<font color="yellow">You're home early.</font>

210
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,320
<font color="yellow">Weren't you supposed
to have lunch with her?</font>

211
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,680
<font color="yellow">I didn't eat with her.</font>

212
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,909
<font color="yellow">Why? She would've bought you
something delicious to eat.</font>

213
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,670
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to eat at home.</font>

214
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,730
<font color="yellow">You bought meat.</font>

215
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,660
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I want to eat it.</font>

216
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,809
<font color="yellow">- You don't like it?
- I don't feel like eating it</font>

217
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,450
<font color="yellow">but I'll give it a taste
since you bought it.</font>

218
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,119
<font color="yellow">You said you were only
going to give it a taste.</font>

219
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,010
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but I still can't taste it.</font>

220
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,780
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly, or you'll lose your jaw.</font>

221
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,370
<font color="yellow">About the amusement park.</font>

222
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,879
<font color="yellow">- Let's go tomorrow.
- Really?</font>

223
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

224
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,680
<font color="yellow">Hey, that's not fully cooked.
Eat this one.</font>

225
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,690
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

226
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,360
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

227
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,839
<font color="yellow">You're my partner.
Wear it when you work.</font>

228
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,590
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

229
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,810
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

230
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,620
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

231
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,460
<font color="yellow">The breeze is cool and nice.</font>

232
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,460
<font color="yellow">I like it too.</font>

233
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,060
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry it up!</font>

234
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,949
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim, help this team out.
- Okay.</font>

235
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,869
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's hurry it up!
There's not much time left!</font>

236
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,400
<font color="yellow">- Okay, we got it.
- Come on!</font>

237
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,969
<font color="yellow">- Come on, let's go!
- This is scary.</font>

238
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,219
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to be afraid of!</font>

239
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,010
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you twice the amount,
so let's get this over with!</font>

240
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,749
<font color="yellow">- I'm not sure about this.
- It's perfectly fine!</font>

241
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,599
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, over here! Hurry it up!</font>

242
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,880
<font color="yellow">- Hurry it up!
- We're going!</font>

243
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,000
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

244
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,339
<font color="yellow">Excuse me? Hello?</font>

245
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,590
<font color="yellow">Hello? I can't hear
you very well. Hold on!</font>

246
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,690
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

247
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,359
<font color="yellow">I see. What am I supposed to do then?</font>

248
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,289
<font color="yellow">We have to take it down in
order to occupy the space.</font>

249
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,780
<font color="yellow">Ghosts or whatever!
We have to make a living too!</font>

250
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,330
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

251
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,460
<font color="yellow">I swear!</font>

252
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,509
<font color="yellow">What's wrong over there?</font>

253
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,840
<font color="yellow"><i>The backup generator has gone out!</i></font>

254
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,430
<font color="yellow">Seriously, nothing is going as planned!</font>

255
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,090
<font color="yellow"><i>Who is crazy? Me?</i></font>

256
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,020
<font color="yellow">- <i>Who is crazy? I am?</i>
- What the heck?</font>

257
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,660
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm not crazy!
Why would I be crazy? Why? Why?</i></font>

258
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,690
<font color="yellow"><i>Who is crazy?
I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy!</i></font>

259
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:43,189
<font color="yellow">Wow! Wow, did we really get a job to do?</font>

260
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:50,029
<font color="yellow">We've been hoping it wouldn't
be the Samil Mental Institute.</font>

261
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,530
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

262
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,059
<font color="yellow">- Did you call Bong Pal?
- Of course.</font>

263
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,220
<font color="yellow">Make sure you check the camera and all
the necessary equipment thoroughly today.</font>

264
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,799
<font color="yellow">We might be able to capture
a ghost on camera for real today.</font>

265
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,080
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

266
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,010
<font color="yellow">Setting!</font>

267
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,810
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

268
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,910
<font color="yellow">It fits you well.</font>

269
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,769
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do
about the amusement park today?</font>

270
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,019
<font color="yellow">- We're supposed to go today.
- We can go after work.</font>

271
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,809
<font color="yellow">Work hard so we can get there quickly.</font>

272
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,290
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

273
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,010
<font color="yellow">Senior, where are we going today?
You brought the camera with you.</font>

274
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,150
<font color="yellow">Huh? Oh...</font>

275
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,139
<font color="yellow">Make sure you're ready today.</font>

276
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

277
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:29,890
<font color="yellow">The place we're going to is one of
the scariest locations in the world.</font>

278
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,169
<font color="yellow">That's right.
It's the Samil Mental Institute!</font>

279
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,080
<font color="yellow">- Is it your first time hearing about it?
- Yes.</font>

280
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,709
<font color="yellow">Everything about Bong Pal is great,
but he's clueless about this field.</font>

281
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,640
<font color="yellow">In Rang will give you
the 411 on that place.</font>

282
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,930
<font color="yellow">That place was shut down
due to human rights issues.</font>

283
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,169
<font color="yellow"><i>The doctors and caretakers illegally
held the patients against their will</i></font>

284
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,060
<font color="yellow"><i>and abused them as well.
It was very severe.</i></font>

285
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,399
<font color="yellow"><i>One patient couldn't take
it anymore and escaped.</i></font>

286
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
<font color="yellow"><i>That's how the world found
out about the hospital.</i></font>

287
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:10,239
<font color="yellow"><i>The police came and discovered
seven patients who died in the hospital.</i></font>

288
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,970
<font color="yellow"><i>Seven people.</i></font>

289
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,919
<font color="yellow">The building owner called exorcists
and shamans to get rid of the ghosts.</font>

290
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,670
<font color="yellow">There are rumors that a shaman fainted
within 30 minutes of entering.</font>

291
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,320
<font color="yellow">This is a place full of
ghosts with deep grudges.</font>

292
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,940
<font color="yellow">Hey, look over here.</font>

293
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,330
<font color="yellow">What the heck?</font>

294
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,329
<font color="yellow">Wow, Chun Sang!</font>

295
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,839
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang, Chun Sang, Chun Sang!</font>

296
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,500

Why are they doing this kind of work?</font>

What's wrong?</font>

306
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,390

I think it's over there.</font>

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,059

316
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,229
<font color="yellow">- Hold me tight.
- I will hold you tight.</font>

317

I have to hold your hands?</font>

318

<font color="yellow">Let's just go.</font>

319
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,189

320
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,270
<font color="yellow">Where did they go?</font>

321
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,379
<font color="yellow">It looks like something is in there.</font>

322
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,089
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

324
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,020
<font color="yellow">- Oh my god! What is this?
- It's just string.</font>

325
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,930
<font color="yellow">- Where is Bong Pal?
- What?</font>

326
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,630

- Bong Pal. Bong Pal!</font>

328
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,069

329
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,949
<font color="yellow">He may not have gotten here yet.</font>

330
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,440
<font color="yellow">He might have gotten lost...</font>

331
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,850

- Call him.</font>

332
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,850

333
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,630

335
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,429

336
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,430

337
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,580
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't touch things in here.</font>

338
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,690
<font color="yellow">- I told you not to touch things in here.
- I'm sorry.</font>

339
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,420
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, didn't you say
seven people died in this hospital?</font>

340
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,210
<font color="yellow">Yes, why do you ask?</font>

341
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,780

355
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,360
<font color="yellow">I wonder what it is...</font>

356
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,759

00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,880

<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

378
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,470
<font color="yellow">It's just that...</font>

379
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,740
<font color="yellow">Do you walk around with
a ghost by any chance?</font>

380
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,819
<font color="yellow">It's just that...</font>

381
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,679
<font color="yellow">Do you walk around with
a ghost by any chance?</font>

382
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,940
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

383
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:24,169
<font color="yellow">No, she was an angel.
Isn't she with us now?</font>

384
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:27,129
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- I saw everything earlier.</font>

385
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,510
<font color="yellow">I saw her rescue us.</font>

386
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,569
<font color="yellow">Didn't you? I did see her.</font>

387
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,070

a ghost fight another ghost.</font>

388
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,549
<font color="yellow">Are you working with that angel?</font>

389
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,669
<font color="yellow">Yes, but she's no angel.</font>

390
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,049
<font color="yellow">- Her name is Hyun Ji, Kim Hyun Ji.
- Hyun Ji?</font>

391
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,990
<font color="yellow">Kim Hyun Ji. What a pretty name.</font>

392
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,650
<font color="yellow">Is it? So is she right next to us now?</font>

393
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,899
<font color="yellow">She's right here.</font>

394
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
<font color="yellow">Right here?</font>

395
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:08,189
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji, thanks so much for
saving us last time and also this time.</font>

396
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,090
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

397
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,310
<font color="yellow">you're so pretty.</font>

398
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,529
<font color="yellow">Oh my, it was no problem.</font>

399
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,920
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty, all right.
Don't you agree?</font>

400
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,699
<font color="yellow">I can't stand hearing this. I just can't.</font>

401
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:26,070
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.
So Hyun Ji is right around here...</font>

402
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,070
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

403
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,320
<font color="yellow">I was just wondering
if she was around here...</font>

404
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,759
<font color="yellow">Still, you can't touch a girl like that.</font>

405
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,950
<font color="yellow">Did my hand touch her?</font>

406
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,420
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji, I'm sorry.
I didn't think it'd touch you.</font>

407
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,570
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter with you?
- I will go now.</font>

408
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,450
<font color="yellow">- Hurry. Aren't we going today?
- I'm coming.</font>

409
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,200
<font color="yellow">Bye bye.</font>

410
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,740
<font color="yellow">No way. Such a thing is here, huh?</font>

411
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,990
<font color="yellow">He was acting funny.
Why did he get mad?</font>

412
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,550
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow!</font>

413
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,440
<font color="yellow"><i>[TICKET OFFICE]</i></font>

414
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,819
<font color="yellow">Can I go in now?</font>

415
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,359
<font color="yellow">- Now?
- Yes.</font>

416
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,339
<font color="yellow">You can, but you won't
get to ride many at this hour.</font>

417
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,990
<font color="yellow">You may be able to ride
only the Ferris wheel.</font>

418
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,969

419
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,950

- Sure, it's 10,000.</font>

come at this hour yesterday?</font>

421
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,379
<font color="yellow">Ah, I did...</font>

422
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,610
<font color="yellow">The last ride of the Ferris wheel
will be in 10 minutes.</font>

423
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,240
<font color="yellow">Let's run. We might be late.</font>

424
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,779
<font color="yellow">- Here it is.
- You're riding this alone?</font>

425
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

426
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,280
<font color="yellow">Did you come here yesterday?</font>

427
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:51,489
<font color="yellow">Well, yes, I did come,
but I was late.</font>

428
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,160
<font color="yellow">You weren't here, either.</font>

429
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,900
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

430
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,279
<font color="yellow">Too bad that you will only
get to ride one tonight.</font>

431
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,569
<font color="yellow">I still like it.</font>

432
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,339
<font color="yellow">If you do well on exams,
I will bring you here again.</font>

433
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,990
<font color="yellow">- Let's get here earlier then.
- Sure.</font>

434
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,489
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

435
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,650
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you'd like
something like this.</font>

436
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,570
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

437
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,110
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

438
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,400
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

439
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,030
<font color="yellow">- Well, Hyun Ji...
- Don't say anything.</font>

440
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,360
<font color="yellow">I didn't say that to hear your answer.</font>

441
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,010
<font color="yellow">It's just how I feel.</font>

442
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,569
<font color="yellow">I'm crazy. So crazy.</font>

443
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,739
<font color="yellow">Why did I have to tell him
that I like him right then?</font>

444
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,570

to face Bong Pal again?</font>

445
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,900

446
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,900
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can go home like this.</font>

447
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,780
<font color="yellow">Look at me, please.</font>

448
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:01,760
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

449
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,610
<font color="yellow">What should I do, huh?</font>

450
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,150
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Hyun Ji.</font>

451
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,740
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

452
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,700
<font color="yellow">How could you disappear like that?</font>

453
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,869
<font color="yellow">Kim Hyun Ji!</font>

454
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:40,970
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

455
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,199
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo, hello.</font>

456
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,630
<font color="yellow">You live nearby, huh?</font>

457
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,759
<font color="yellow">Yes. So this is your hospital, huh?</font>

458
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,649
<font color="yellow">I've passed by this place so many times.</font>

459
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,669
<font color="yellow">By the way, who were
you calling just now?</font>

460
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,809
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
- I thought you were calling someone.</font>

461
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,149
<font color="yellow">- Kim Hyun Ji?
- Ah...</font>

462
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,359
<font color="yellow">- Is she your girlfriend?
- No.</font>

463
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,360
<font color="yellow">- She's just someone I know.
- Ah, is she?</font>

464
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,299
<font color="yellow">I will go now then.</font>

465
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,419
<font color="yellow">Sure, get home safe.</font>

466
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,860
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

467
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,529
<font color="yellow">What should I say
when I see Bong Pal again?</font>

468
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,570
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what should I do?</font>

469
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,150
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji, are you asleep?</font>

470
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,970
<font color="yellow">Get some sleep then.</font>

471
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,900
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

472
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,810
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

473
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,780
<font color="yellow">Is he still asleep?</font>

474
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:02,220
<font color="yellow">- Good morning.
- It sure is...</font>

475
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,190
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the bathroom...</font>

476
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,050
<font color="yellow">What good morning, gosh.</font>

477
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,380
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm done.</font>

478
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,280
<font color="yellow">I'm full, too.</font>

479
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,630
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is crazy.</font>

480
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,129
<font color="yellow">So what? She could
have feelings for me.</font>

481
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,739
<font color="yellow">It's not a reason to avoid her.</font>

482
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,109
<font color="yellow">Okay then. Go out and act natural.</font>

483
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,900
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay.</font>

484
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,820
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so uncomfortable and crazy.</font>

485
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,260
<font color="yellow">Act natural.</font>

486
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,359
<font color="yellow">Gosh, should I go stay
somewhere else?</font>

487
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,189
<font color="yellow">There is no other place to go.</font>

488
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,800
<font color="yellow">It's so uncomfortable
for two of us alone.</font>

489
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,940
<font color="yellow"><i>[CHUN SANG]</i></font>

490
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,090
<font color="yellow">Hi, Chun Sang. I will be right there.</font>

491
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,109
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji, we have work. Let's go.</font>

492
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,990
<font color="yellow">- Do we? Let's go.
- Sure.</font>

493
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,650
<font color="yellow">Sure, I should do something or anything.</font>

494
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:38,189
<font color="yellow">You sure know how to do
a good job. Are you already done?</font>

495
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,010
<font color="yellow">We will get some money again today.</font>

496
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,989
<font color="yellow">I don't know where she is,
but you also did a good job, Hyun Ji.</font>

497
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,900
<font color="yellow">- Good work.
- Chun Sang, she's over here.</font>

498
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,969
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

499
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,049
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is In Rang?</font>

500
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,969
<font color="yellow">He said he had to go
get something from the car.</font>

501
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:01,899
<font color="yellow">- Wait. Are you already done?
- Yes, it's done.</font>

502
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,439
<font color="yellow">- Is she hurt?
- I'm not hurt.</font>

503
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,530
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about Hyun Ji, not you.
Is she hurt?</font>

504
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,219
<font color="yellow">- She's not hurt at all.
- Oh my, thank God.</font>

505
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:19,110
<font color="yellow">- So Hyun Ji is with us now, right?
- Correct.</font>

506
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,590
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji, I got something for you.</font>

507
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,420
<font color="yellow">- What did you get?
- What could it be?</font>

508
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,740
<font color="yellow">- These.
- Wow, they are heels.</font>

509
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,529
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- Hey.</font>

510
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,529
<font color="yellow">You've never gotten me anything.</font>

511
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,899
<font color="yellow">You got heels for a ghost
you can't even see?</font>

512
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,199
<font color="yellow">Quiet.</font>

513
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,779
<font color="yellow">Does Hyun Ji seem to like these?</font>

514
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,220
<font color="yellow">Tell him that I love them.</font>

515
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,550
<font color="yellow">She hates them.</font>

516
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,010
<font color="yellow">I said I love them.</font>

517
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,219
<font color="yellow">She hates them?</font>

518
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,469
<font color="yellow">She says she's never
liked heels. Right?</font>

519
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,089
<font color="yellow">I do like heels.</font>

520
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:11,279
<font color="yellow">She's never liked them, huh?</font>

521
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,719
<font color="yellow">- Well, too bad then.
- Isn't it?</font>

522
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,880
<font color="yellow">- We will go now.
- Sure.</font>

523
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,319
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why do you lie?</font>

524
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,419
<font color="yellow">I so want to accept these...</font>

525
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,590
<font color="yellow">Park Bong Pal!</font>

526
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,279
<font color="yellow">No matter what you do,
certain things just can't work out.</font>

527
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,690
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

528
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,699
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I
went through to get these?</font>

529
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,629
<font color="yellow">We will exchange them.</font>

530
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,469
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? Our doctor?
- Correct.</font>

531
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,819
<font color="yellow">What was his schedule on the first?</font>

532
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,419
<font color="yellow">He didn't have
anything specific that day.</font>

533
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,799
<font color="yellow">He was seeing patients
until the afternoon.</font>

534
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,069
<font color="yellow">What time in the afternoon?</font>

535
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,569
<font color="yellow">He ended early that day.
Around seven.</font>

536
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,129
<font color="yellow">He usually stays until nine.</font>

537
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:06,089
<font color="yellow">- He may have had an appointment then.
- Was it that day?</font>

538
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,609
<font color="yellow">- It's when he didn't get back.
- He didn't get back all night?</font>

539
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:12,779
<font color="yellow">Correct. He usually sleeps here.</font>

540
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:17,529
<font color="yellow">He left earlier and came back
the next morning that day.</font>

541
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,569
<font color="yellow">- Oh my, you're here!
- Hello, Director.</font>

542
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:23,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being late. Please prepare
everything until I get back from class.</font>

543
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,219
<font color="yellow">Where has he been
to get mud on his shoes?</font>

544
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,800
<font color="yellow">- He came back with mud on his shoes.
- Correct.</font>

545
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,969
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

546
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,739
<font color="yellow">- You're late.
- I had a seminar.</font>

547
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,939
<font color="yellow">What brings you here today?</font>

548
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,719
<font color="yellow">We just came by for routine questions.</font>

549
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,950
<font color="yellow">We're off now. See you next time.</font>

550
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,400
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

551
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,650
<font color="yellow">- Was everything okay?
- Yes.</font>

552
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,490
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

553
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:26,570
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?
You wouldn't let me accept the present.</font>

554
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:30,219
<font color="yellow">I agree. Why did I do that?
It's so childish.</font>

555
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,220
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

556
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,740
<font color="yellow">You've changed your clothes.</font>

557
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,740
<font color="yellow">- It's convenient being a ghost.
- Well, you know how it is.</font>

558
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,360
<font color="yellow">I can't take this anymore.
It's so uncomfortable.</font>

559
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,300
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

560
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,840
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

561
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,199
<font color="yellow">Shall we play a game
to grant our wishes?</font>

562
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,379
<font color="yellow">We will play rock-paper-scissors.</font>

563
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,050
<font color="yellow">Whoever loses will have to
grant the winner's wish.</font>

564
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,169
<font color="yellow">Why grant wishes?
I don't want to play.</font>

565
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,169
<font color="yellow">Can we please do it?</font>

566
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,930
<font color="yellow">I didn't even get the heels or anything.</font>

567
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,629
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's play.</font>

568
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,859
<font color="yellow">We're doing it.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!</font>

569
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,630
<font color="yellow">I won!</font>

570
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:34,860
<font color="yellow">Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!</font>

571
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,380
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Hooray!</font>

572
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,379
<font color="yellow">Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Hooray!</font>

573
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,970
<font color="yellow">One, two.</font>

574
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,610
<font color="yellow">Yes! Hooray!</font>

575
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:52,200
<font color="yellow">Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Hooray!</font>

576
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,470
<font color="yellow">I won! Hooray!</font>

577
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,839
<font color="yellow">You're such a kid.</font>

578
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,969
<font color="yellow">So what's your wish?</font>

579
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:07,470
<font color="yellow">Well, my wish would be...</font>

580
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:26,590
<font color="yellow">to take back what I said yesterday.</font>

581
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,360
<font color="yellow">I don't like being uncomfortable
with each other.</font>

582
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,200
<font color="yellow">Just forget everything I said.</font>

583
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,360
<font color="yellow">That's my wish.</font>

584
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,200
<font color="yellow">One minute you're confessing
and now you want me to forget?</font>

585
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,550
<font color="yellow">Why are you confusing me?</font>

586
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,220
<font color="yellow">You understand, right?</font>

587
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,700
<font color="yellow">It's my wish,
so you have to do what I ask.</font>

588
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,569
<font color="yellow">If you do what I ask now</font>

589
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,110
<font color="yellow">I can stay with you longer.</font>

590
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:00,070
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

591
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,549
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji.</font>

592
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,780
<font color="yellow">I'm not feeling well...</font>

593
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,780
<font color="yellow">Kim Hyun Ji.</font>

594
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,720
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.
- Hyun Ji...</font>

595
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,670
