45
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,160
<font color="yellow">- It wasn't funny at all.
- You know you liked it. You smiled.</font>

46
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,790
<font color="yellow">- What is this then?
- Don't. Just don't.</font>

- No!</font>

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,420
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

49
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,760
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's new club members
who just joined our club.</font>

50
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,310
<font color="yellow">Two people, at that.</font>

51
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,340
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

52
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,050
<font color="yellow">I wonder what this is?</font>

53
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,230

Take it and give us our key.</font>

The voting is over as well.</font>

56
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,660
<font color="yellow">So when you say it's disbanded... you're
saying our club has been terminated...</font>

57
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,970
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang, what is he talking about?</font>

58
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,170
<font color="yellow">I knew this would happen,
so I prepared this.</font>

59
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,970
<font color="yellow">A new club request form.</font>

60
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,650
<font color="yellow">The manager has even signed off on it.</font>

61
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,550
<font color="yellow">It's been signed. Chun Sang,
when did you prepare all this?</font>

62
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,000
<font color="yellow">The club name is "Blood Sausage Soup."</font>

63
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,890
<font color="yellow">Blood sausage soup?</font>

64
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,760
<font color="yellow"><i>[BLOOD SAUSAGE SOUP]</i></font>

65
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,460
<font color="yellow">Even if it's taken away from us,
would that happen again?</font>

66
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,640
<font color="yellow">God... thank you.</font>

67
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,360
<font color="yellow">It's still here! It's our table!</font>

68
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,740
<font color="yellow">It's ours, Chun Sang.</font>

69
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,060
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang!</font>

70
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,280
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang, this isn't a dream, right?</font>

71
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,490
<font color="yellow">If it is, I don't want to wake up.</font>

72
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,660
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

73
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,680
<font color="yellow">- Yes, it hurts. I think it's real.
- I thought so.</font>

74
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,410
<font color="yellow">- You were scared, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't.</font>

75
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,930
<font color="yellow">This is the perfect day to have a picnic.</font>

76
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,770
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, should we pack some
kimbap and go on a picnic?</font>

77
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,420
<font color="yellow">Picnic, my butt.</font>

78
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,880
<font color="yellow">I have finals to study for
and you need to study for your exams.</font>

79
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,670
<font color="yellow">You only think about
having fun all the time.</font>

80
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,090
<font color="yellow">You have to take a break on a day
like this in order to study better.</font>

81
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,490
<font color="yellow">- Is that so?
- Yes.</font>

82
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,130
<font color="yellow">Someone might think you've
been studying for a very long time.</font>

83
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,170
<font color="yellow">It's barely been a week
since you started.</font>

84
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,350
<font color="yellow">You're so unromantic.</font>

85
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,860
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

86
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,100
<font color="yellow">Why are you blushing?</font>

87
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,300
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

88
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,000
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

89
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,200
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her now?</font>

90
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,890
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what's the matter with me?</font>

91
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,430
<font color="yellow">It's still pounding.</font>

92
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Hyun Ji!</i></font>

93
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,980
<font color="yellow">Kyung Ja, you're still here?
You haven't found that man yet?</font>

94
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,410
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think I'm going to
have to set up shop here</font>

95
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,230
<font color="yellow">until I find my honey.</font>

96
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,790
<font color="yellow">What's with the look on your face?</font>

97
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,460
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

98
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,610
<font color="yellow">Kyung Ja, I think there's
something wrong with me.</font>

99
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,810
<font color="yellow">In what way?</font>

100
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,670
<font color="yellow">Do ghosts' hearts pound?</font>

101
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,490
<font color="yellow">Well, the feelings of a ghost are
the same as when they're alive.</font>

102
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, that can happen.
But why do you ask?</font>

103
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,920
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

104
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,440
<font color="yellow">I don't know when it started, but my
heart races whenever I see Bong Pal.</font>

105
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,030
<font color="yellow">And I suddenly get nervous.</font>

106
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,070
<font color="yellow">You get nervous? And?</font>

107
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,600
<font color="yellow">It hurts here.</font>

108
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,200
<font color="yellow">There's something wrong
with me, isn't there?</font>

109
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,450
<font color="yellow">From what I see, I think you like him.</font>

110
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,270
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

111
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,750
<font color="yellow">- I have feelings for Bong Pal?
- Yes.</font>

112
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,550
<font color="yellow">You said your heart races whenever
you see him. That means you like him.</font>

113
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,430
<font color="yellow">There's no way! Absolutely not!</font>

114
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,230
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah?</font>

115
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,700
<font color="yellow">If that's not the case...</font>

116
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,750
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you have
some sort of heart disease?</font>

117
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,500
<font color="yellow">It must be nice to go on a retreat.</font>

118
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,340
<font color="yellow">How great would it be to dunk your
feet in a river on a day like this?</font>

119
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,630
<font color="yellow">- That sounds awesome.
- With a slice of cold watermelon.</font>

120
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,280
<font color="yellow">And in the evening,
we'd sit around a bonfire...</font>

121
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,580
<font color="yellow">and drink beer! Just pop
a cold can of beer and...</font>

122
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,430
<font color="yellow">No. No... let's go on an retreat too!</font>

123
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,970
<font color="yellow">We have new members and our club back.</font>

124
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,090
<font color="yellow">It'll be a celebration
and grand opening of our new club!</font>

125
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,330
<font color="yellow">A grand opening?
That's a good idea! I love it!</font>

126
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,670
<font color="yellow">But do you think Bong Pal will go?</font>

127
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,730
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

128
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,450
<font color="yellow">Put both hands together
and raise them straight to the ceiling.</font>

129
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,970
<font color="yellow">Raise your left arm
and look up at the ceiling.</font>

130
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:09,400
<font color="yellow">Stretch your leg back as you
stretch the left arm in front of you.</font>

131
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,270
<font color="yellow">Slowly lower your leg.</font>

132
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,960
<font color="yellow">Why did we come here?</font>

133
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,330
<font color="yellow">We have to take Bong Pal to the retreat.</font>

134
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,040
<font color="yellow">Our secret weapon is over there.</font>

135
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,000
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Miss Im Seo Yeon.</font>

136
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,840
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

137
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,790
<font color="yellow">We were admitted to the university
in 2010 and took four years off</font>

138
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,160
<font color="yellow">due to financial hardship
and serving our country. Not once...</font>

139
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,070
<font color="yellow">Not once did we go on a retreat in our
time here at Myungsung University.</font>

140
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,930
<font color="yellow">We really want to go.</font>

141
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,180
<font color="yellow">We want to go and experience this awesome
moment while we're still in college.</font>

142
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,320
<font color="yellow">But with retreats, two is better
than one, three is better than two</font>

143
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,600
<font color="yellow">and four is better than three.</font>

144
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,230
<font color="yellow">It's not easy for us to ask
this heavy favor from you.</font>

145
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,930
<font color="yellow">You want me to go on
a retreat with you guys, right?</font>

146
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,350
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's correct.</font>

147
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,830
<font color="yellow">Why did Kyung Ja say that?
That doesn't make sense!</font>

148
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,020
<font color="yellow">Why would I like him?</font>

149
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,030
<font color="yellow">Sorry!</font>

150
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,030
<font color="yellow">Why did Kyung Ja say that?
That doesn't make sense!</font>

151
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,590
<font color="yellow">Why would I like him?</font>

152
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,680
<font color="yellow">Sorry!</font>

153
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,900
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

154
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,290
<font color="yellow">Maybe Kyung Ja was right.</font>

155
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,740
<font color="yellow">I told you to be aware
of your surroundings.</font>

156
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,570
<font color="yellow">Oh... I was preoccupied, so...</font>

157
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,430
<font color="yellow">Why don't you be
preoccupied with studying?</font>

158
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,080
<font color="yellow">Also, where do you keep roaming around?</font>

159
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,700
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

160
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,180
<font color="yellow">Were you bored without me in class?</font>

161
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,500
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

162
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,380
<font color="yellow">It was actually really nice to be able
to focus in class without you there.</font>

163
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,090
<font color="yellow">No, no. There's no way
I would like a guy like him.</font>

164
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,710
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

165
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,030
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Bong Pal?</font>

166
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,020
<font color="yellow">A retreat?</font>

167
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,310
<font color="yellow">It's not just any retreat.
It's membership training.</font>

168
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,080
<font color="yellow">It will be the grand opening
of the Blood Sausage Soup club</font>

169
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,560
<font color="yellow">and welcome orientation
for the new members.</font>

170
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,290
<font color="yellow">A variety, spectacular,
action, suspense retreat!</font>

171
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,100
<font color="yellow">Oh, a retreat?</font>

172
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,430
<font color="yellow">It sounds like fun! Let's go!</font>

173
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,700
<font color="yellow">I'm not really feeling it.</font>

174
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,980
<font color="yellow">You don't have to prepare anything.</font>

175
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,040
<font color="yellow">The car, food, location...</font>

176
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,490
<font color="yellow">and the various activities
are all in one full package.</font>

177
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,460
<font color="yellow">Let's go! You don't have to pay!
It's for free!</font>

178
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,930
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

179
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,560
<font color="yellow">Well, if you're not feeling it...</font>

180
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,010
<font color="yellow">Im Seo Yeon mentioned
she's pretty exhausted from her studies.</font>

181
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,170
<font color="yellow">She agreed to come along.</font>

182
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,020
<font color="yellow">Well, if you're not feeling it, then...</font>

183
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,650
<font color="yellow">Maybe we shouldn't go.
It doesn't sound like fun.</font>

184
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,700
<font color="yellow">Ah, I hear it might rain tomorrow.</font>

185
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,990
<font color="yellow">So, are you not going to go?</font>

186
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,710
<font color="yellow">I guess it's just us three then.</font>

187
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,130
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's just us three.</font>

188
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,460
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's not go.</font>

189
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,040
<font color="yellow">Well... I'll think about going.</font>

190
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,330
<font color="yellow">- Let's make it four of us.
- Okay.</font>

191
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,450
<font color="yellow">Detective, the identity of the
dead body has been confirmed.</font>

192
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,800
<font color="yellow">No Hyun Joo.</font>

193
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,050
<font color="yellow">She's a Myungsung University student.</font>

194
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,510
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- The cause of death?</font>

195
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,720
<font color="yellow">She died of asphyxiation.</font>

196
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,220
<font color="yellow">It's most likely she was strangled
by someone's hands.</font>

197
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,620
<font color="yellow">Her neck was broken.</font>

198
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,490
<font color="yellow">How is that possible with human hands?</font>

199
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,170
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm not sure.</font>

200
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,850
<font color="yellow">Did you check the time of death?</font>

201
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, the time of death was 24 hours ago.</font>

202
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,100
<font color="yellow">She was supposed to go to class
that day, but she skipped it.</font>

203
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,460
<font color="yellow">There's no trace of
her whereabouts after that.</font>

204
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,800
<font color="yellow">She missed class?
What class was it?</font>

205
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,670
<font color="yellow">It's a humanities class.</font>

206
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,840
<font color="yellow">A class called Animal Society
taught by Professor Joo Hye Sung.</font>

207
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,600
<font color="yellow">It seems like she was
very interested in animals.</font>

208
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,680
<font color="yellow">- Welcome.
- Hello.</font>

209
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,220
<font color="yellow">- Seo Yeon.
- Hello, Professor.</font>

210
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,930
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?
Hi, Byul! Have you been well?</font>

211
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,260
<font color="yellow">Is Byul sick? He looks healthy.</font>

212
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,390
<font color="yellow">No. I was hoping you would
watch him tomorrow.</font>

213
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,580
<font color="yellow">- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes, there's a club retreat.</font>

214
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,940
<font color="yellow">A retreat? How exciting.</font>

215
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,850
<font color="yellow">What club is it?</font>

216
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,750
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what club it is...</font>

217
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,800
<font color="yellow">Ah, Bong Pal is in the club too.</font>

218
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,550
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal must be going as well.</font>

219
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,550
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

220
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,100
<font color="yellow">- So...
- Yes?</font>

221
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,510
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

222
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,500
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything
and for Byul as well.</font>

223
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's fine.
You shouldn't have.</font>

224
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,900
<font color="yellow">Wow, the present is small, though.</font>

225
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,490
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

226
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,520
<font color="yellow">I'm kidding. Can I open it?</font>

227
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

228
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,420
<font color="yellow">It's a fountain pen.</font>

229
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,160
<font color="yellow">I was just about to buy one.
This is perfect. Thank you.</font>

230
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,570
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

231
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,380
<font color="yellow">- It's just you and me, Byul.
- Say hi to the professor.</font>

232
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, he's gotten big.</font>

233
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,610
<font color="yellow">When I asked, you didn't want to go
on a picnic with me because of class.</font>

234
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,940
<font color="yellow">- What's up with that?
- That class wasn't that urgent.</font>

235
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,640
<font color="yellow">I need to study for
my college entrance exams, too!</font>

236
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,440
<font color="yellow">Let's just study at home.
I'm really going to study hard!</font>

237
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,260
<font color="yellow">You said we needed to take
a break once in a while.</font>

238
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,830
<font color="yellow">Once you start having fun,
you can't stop.</font>

239
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,910
<font color="yellow">Let's stay home, okay?</font>

240
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,860
<font color="yellow">Then you stay home and study.
I never said I was taking you.</font>

241
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,430
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

242
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,310
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

243
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,950
<font color="yellow">I told you not to follow me.
Why did you come?</font>

244
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
<font color="yellow">Well, you'll be gone. What am
I going to do at home by myself?</font>

245
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,410
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to take care of
you because there's too many people.</font>

246
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,540
<font color="yellow">- I know that.
- Bong Pal.</font>

247
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,010
<font color="yellow">Senior!</font>

248
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,860
<font color="yellow">It's just an retreat.
Why is she all dressed up?</font>

249
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,910
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're
going to a fashion show.</font>

250
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,650
<font color="yellow">It's that car again?</font>

251
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,020
<font color="yellow">How are we all going to fit in there?</font>

252
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,420
<font color="yellow"><i>The sky is open to us!</i></font>

253
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,690
<font color="yellow"><i>I have you!</i></font>

254
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,560
<font color="yellow">It's kind of tight back there, isn't it?
Sorry, we have so much stuff.</font>

255
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,000
<font color="yellow">We only have an hour
to go, so hang in there.</font>

256
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,040
<font color="yellow">We have to stay like this for an hour?</font>

257
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,130
<font color="yellow">- Darn it!
- Be patient. We're almost there.</font>

258
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,380
<font color="yellow">You know, you two look like a couple.</font>

259
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,660
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal has a sky blue shirt on
and so does Seo Yeon. Sky blue!</font>

260
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,060
<font color="yellow">It's not sky blue!
Bong Pal's shirt is sea blue!</font>

261
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,700
<font color="yellow">Watch how you're driving!</font>

262
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,960
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so tired.</font>

263
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,070
<font color="yellow">- This place is very nice.
- How did they rent this?</font>

264
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,410
<font color="yellow">Wow, whose vacation home is this?</font>

265
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,580
<font color="yellow">This vacation home belongs to
my one and only junior, my best friend.</font>

266
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,570
<font color="yellow">They call him "young master" at home.
This is In Rang's vacation home.</font>

267
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,340
<font color="yellow">Young master? Really?</font>

268
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,360
<font color="yellow">It's unexpected, right?</font>

269
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,260
<font color="yellow">It is surprising.
Our In Rang is that kind of person.</font>

270
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,400
<font color="yellow">He's very wealthy,
but he doesn't show it.</font>

271
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,030
<font color="yellow">He's such a humble man.
Just your average Joe.</font>

272
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,010
<font color="yellow">Is that a compliment?</font>

273
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,540
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

274
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,450
<font color="yellow">This vacation home is really nice.</font>

275
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,860
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

276
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,850
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about him.
He gets speechless around women.</font>

277
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,540
<font color="yellow">He's very bashful and shy.</font>

278
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,540
<font color="yellow">Okay then, let's take our
belongings and enter the premises!</font>

279
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,900
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Hurry up
and open the door! This is heavy!</font>

280
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,140
<font color="yellow">I think my grandma changed the passcode.</font>

281
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,430
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

282
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,230
<font color="yellow">- You didn't know she changed it?
- I didn't ask.</font>

283
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,890
<font color="yellow">My grandma will kill you if she
finds out that I came here with you.</font>

284
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,570
<font color="yellow">Why does your grandma
always want to kill me?</font>

285
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,410
<font color="yellow">Just do something.</font>

286
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,740
<font color="yellow">My grandma's birthday!</font>

287
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,460
<font color="yellow">This is In Rang's vacation home for sure.</font>

288
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,110
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how strange.</font>

289
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,790
<font color="yellow">- Please be careful next time.
- Thank you.</font>

290
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,070
<font color="yellow">- Thanks. It's really my vacation home!
- It's definitely his vacation home!</font>

291
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,210
<font color="yellow">Did your grandma throw a fit?</font>

292
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,450
<font color="yellow">She asked if "he" was
there and I said no.</font>

293
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,820
<font color="yellow">- Who is "he"?
- You.</font>

294
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,060
<font color="yellow">Good job!</font>

295
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,110
<font color="yellow">- Please come in.
- Okay.</font>

296
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,600
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, this is heavy!
- Come in.</font>

297
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,910
<font color="yellow">- This is nice.
- Oh my!</font>

298
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,930
<font color="yellow">- This house is really nice.
- Stay still.</font>

299
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,710
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.
I wonder what's in this house.</font>

300
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,220
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bring
the rest of our stuff inside.</font>

301
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,360
<font color="yellow">That's great. What's gotten into you?</font>

302
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,170
<font color="yellow">Let's go together.
I'll help you.</font>

303
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,110
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's go.</font>

304
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,020
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.
Let's take this bag upstairs.</font>

305
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,260
<font color="yellow">- Okay?
- Huh? Why?</font>

306
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,920
<font color="yellow">Hold on, let me rest on this for a bit.</font>

307
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,130
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's take the bags upstairs.</font>

308
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,280
<font color="yellow">This place is so nice.</font>

309
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,500
<font color="yellow">Hurry up, will you?</font>

310
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,920
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

311
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,120
<font color="yellow">Are you an angel?</font>

312
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,790
<font color="yellow">What happened? What's going on?
In Rang, wake up!</font>

313
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,180
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? You scared me.

314
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,420
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang, I saw an angel.</font>

315
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,030
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous.
You almost became an angel.</font>

316
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,460
<font color="yellow">No, I really saw an angel.
She was right in front of me.</font>

317
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,860
<font color="yellow">You poor boy. You almost
crossed over to the other side.</font>

318
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,660
<font color="yellow">Let me see if there's a hole in the
back of your head. There's no hole.</font>

319
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,030
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- I'm okay!</font>

320
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,790
<font color="yellow">Still, you never know, so let's rest
for a bit. Come here and get on my back.</font>

321
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,270
<font color="yellow">Come here. Okay, let's go.</font>

322
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,220
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to see he's all right.</font>

323
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,460
<font color="yellow">But did he see me?</font>

324
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,840
<font color="yellow">Miss... Miss Angel.</font>

325
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,670
<font color="yellow">Angel.</font>

326
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,670
<font color="yellow">Ang... Angel.</font>

327
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,120
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

328
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,940
<font color="yellow">Miss Angel, I'm fine! I'm fine!</font>

329
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,620
<font color="yellow">Please don't worry, I'm fine.</font>

330
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,600
<font color="yellow">I completely forgot to bring the ramen.</font>

331
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,080
<font color="yellow">Ramen is the best to eat
after drinking, right?</font>

332
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,460
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

333
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,680
<font color="yellow">There's a little grocery store down
the street. Can you go and buy some?</font>

334
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,900
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

335
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,790
<font color="yellow">And if it's boring to go by yourself,
then Seo Yeon can go with you.</font>

336
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,460
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'll go with you.
I have to buy some stuff anyway.</font>

337
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,530
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

338
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,490
<font color="yellow">I'll just take care of this first.</font>

339
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,560
<font color="yellow">Sure, sure, sure.</font>

340
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,970
<font color="yellow">Let me get my wallet from the car.
I forgot to bring it with me.</font>

341
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,970
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

342
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,970
<font color="yellow">What's for dinner tonight?</font>

343
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,220
<font color="yellow">Oh, meat! Nice!</font>

344
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,220
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

345
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,850
<font color="yellow">Take your time buying the ramen.</font>

346
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,340
<font color="yellow">No, you can make the ramen.
Take your sweet time, okay?</font>

347
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,760
<font color="yellow">Take advantage of this romantic moment!</font>

348
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,560
<font color="yellow">I am the messenger of love.
The bridge of love.</font>

349
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,390
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

350
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,520
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, where are you going?
Are you going to buy ramen?</font>

351
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,420
<font color="yellow">- What the heck?
- Love is in the air.</font>

352
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,650
<font color="yellow">Oh, ramen.</font>

353
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,710
<font color="yellow">I am the bridge of love!</font>

354
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,770
<font color="yellow">What the hell?</font>

355
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,720
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

356
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,130
<font color="yellow">You don't need to go get ramen.
We have some inside.</font>

357
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,840
<font color="yellow">He did that to tease you,
so don't go.</font>

358
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,530
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

359
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,590
<font color="yellow">Don't go.
We already have ramen.</font>

360
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,020
<font color="yellow">Seo Yeon has something to get anyway.</font>

361
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,220
<font color="yellow">She can go alone.
Tell her to go alone.</font>

362
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,120
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal, let's go.
- Sure.</font>

363
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,660
<font color="yellow">Stay quiet.
I will be right back.</font>

364
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,180
<font color="yellow">This one too, please.</font>

365
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,410
<font color="yellow">- Did you get everything?
- Yes.</font>

366
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,900
<font color="yellow">Oh my, you look strong
and this one is pretty.</font>

367
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,450
<font color="yellow">Are you two dating?</font>

368
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,470
<font color="yellow">No, we're not.</font>

369
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,740
<font color="yellow">- We go to school together.
- That's how it always starts.</font>

370
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,260
<font color="yellow">Let's see... there are four ice creams.</font>

371
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,390
<font color="yellow">Oh, wait a second.</font>

372
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,350
<font color="yellow">One more, please.</font>

373
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,260
<font color="yellow">Who is it for?
There are only four of us.</font>

374
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,750
<font color="yellow">- I just really like ice cream.
- I see.</font>

375
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,420
<font color="yellow">They were begging,
so I just came along.</font>

376
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,700
<font color="yellow">But I'm glad that I came.</font>

377
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,100
<font color="yellow">I've only been going back and forth
between home and school.</font>

378
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,590
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

379
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,920
<font color="yellow">Isn't it surprising that</font>

380
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,970
<font color="yellow">you and I came to
this retreat together?</font>

381
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,720
<font color="yellow">We weren't close until we started
to take Professor Joo's class.</font>

382
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,110
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

383
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,310
<font color="yellow">What's with your answer?</font>

384
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,910
<font color="yellow">You don't think we didn't
become close, do you?</font>

385
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,910
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

386
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,490
<font color="yellow">I'm kidding.</font>

387
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,050
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's hot.</font>

388
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,690
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

389
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,590
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

390
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,380
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

391
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,060
<font color="yellow">How did you end up
falling and rolling down?</font>

392
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,680
<font color="yellow">Did you fall on the stairs
or trip on your own?</font>

393
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,200
<font color="yellow">Can you just go get me some water?</font>

394
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
<font color="yellow">You just want me to get you water?</font>

395
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,290
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

396
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,020
<font color="yellow">- We're back.
- Hey.</font>

397
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,880
<font color="yellow">Oh my, are you hurt?</font>

398
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
<font color="yellow">My head...</font>

399
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,120
<font color="yellow">What is he saying?</font>

400
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,110
<font color="yellow">Why did you get back so early?</font>

401
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,500
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you take your time?</font>

402
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,140
<font color="yellow">Here it is.</font>

403
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,540
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Of course I am.</font>

404
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,710
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's up with him?</font>

405
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,020
<font color="yellow">He just fell and rolled down the stairs.</font>

406
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,180
<font color="yellow">In Rang, here's ice cream.</font>

407
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

408
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,050
<font color="yellow">There are two left.</font>

409
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,760
<font color="yellow">I will eat these two then.</font>

410
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,460
<font color="yellow">This one is mine.</font>

411
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,520
<font color="yellow">You ate yours on the way here.</font>

412
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
<font color="yellow">I like ice cream.</font>

413
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,580
<font color="yellow">I got it. You're such a pig.</font>

414
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,830
<font color="yellow">I will let you have it.</font>

415
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,210
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Hyun Ji.</font>

416
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,560
<font color="yellow">- Here.
- I won't eat it.</font>

417
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,960
<font color="yellow">Are you sure? I will eat it then.</font>

418
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,910
<font color="yellow">Since when do you care about me?</font>

419
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,080
<font color="yellow">See? This is boring here, isn't it?</font>

420
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,960
<font color="yellow">It's not boring at all.</font>

421
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,680
<font color="yellow">Wow, this sausage looks awesome.</font>

422
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,390
<font color="yellow">We will all have some drinks.</font>

423
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,390
<font color="yellow">Wow, alcohol.</font>

424
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,080
<font color="yellow">- In Rang, come over now.
- Sure.</font>

425
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,460
<font color="yellow">Now let's celebrate
our first retreat.</font>

426
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,960
<font color="yellow">Let's toast to that.</font>

427
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
<font color="yellow">I say "blood sausage" and you say "soup."</font>

428
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,040
<font color="yellow">- To Blood Sausage Soup!
- To Blood Sausage Soup!</font>

429
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,910
<font color="yellow">If you're not going to drink it,
why not give it to me?</font>

430
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,660
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't drink.</font>

431
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,480
<font color="yellow">Wow... meat!</font>

432
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,040
<font color="yellow">In Rang, hurry up. Hurry!</font>

433
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,870
<font color="yellow">Here we have meat.
Have some meat.</font>

434
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,950
<font color="yellow">Now we will go get the meat.</font>

435
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,210
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, the meat looks good.
Can I have some meat?</font>

436
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,350
<font color="yellow">Meat. Meat.</font>

437
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:46,270
<font color="yellow">In Rang, there wasn't any beef
when you were buying pork?</font>

438
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,830
<font color="yellow">Oh my, thanks.</font>

439
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,640
<font color="yellow">I'm in the athletic department.
I should eat beef.</font>

440
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,580
<font color="yellow">- Just eat what we have here.
- Okay.</font>

441
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,480
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

442
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,290
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, the sausage
is good too. Try some.</font>

443
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,770
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

444
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:07,560
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's beautiful to see
how Seo Yeon takes care of Bong Pal.</font>

445
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,830
<font color="yellow">Give that to me.</font>

446
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:16,460
<font color="yellow">Why don't you two start dating?</font>

447
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,270
<font color="yellow">- Oh my.
- Funny.</font>

448
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,710
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- Why not? You two are single.</font>

449
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,430
<font color="yellow">Two lonely single people could go out.</font>

450
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:33,250
<font color="yellow">- Go out! Go out!
- Go out! Go out!</font>

451
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,790
<font color="yellow">True. You could do that.</font>

452
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,710
<font color="yellow">- They can't do that.
- That's enough.</font>

453
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,250
<font color="yellow">We've been hearing
such a thing all day today.</font>

454
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,250
<font color="yellow">It may be because
we're dressed alike today.</font>

455
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,830
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

456
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,310
<font color="yellow">It's weird that the smoke
only goes in her direction.</font>

457
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,850
<font color="yellow">- It's because she's pretty.
- You're right. She's pretty.</font>

458
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,750
<font color="yellow">- Now the smoke is coming toward me.
- No, it isn't.</font>

459
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,660
<font color="yellow">- Senior, let's switch seats.
- It's okay.</font>

460
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,020
<font color="yellow">- Wow, it's beautiful.
- Wow.</font>

461
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,080
<font color="yellow">Oh, you...</font>

462
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,980
<font color="yellow">- To Blood Sausage Soup!
- To blood Sausage Soup!</font>

463
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,500
<font color="yellow">- All right then.
- Thank you.</font>

464
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,890
<font color="yellow">Excuse me,
are you Professor Joo Hye Sung?</font>

465
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,100
<font color="yellow">We should've called first.</font>

466
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,120
<font color="yellow">We were in a hurry,
so please excuse us.</font>

467
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,120
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

468
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,790
<font color="yellow">How can I help you?</font>

469
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:02,390
<font color="yellow">You know one of your students
named No Hyun Joo, right?</font>

470
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,410
<font color="yellow">No Hyun Joo is the one majoring in dance.</font>

471
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,730
<font color="yellow">Correct. When was
the last time you saw her?</font>

472
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,350
<font color="yellow">She's been absent for the last two weeks.</font>

473
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,520
<font color="yellow">That's probably when I saw her last...</font>

474
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,710
<font color="yellow">- Did something happen?
- She was found dead.</font>

475
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,330
<font color="yellow">What? Found dead?</font>

476
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,230
<font color="yellow">Were there any students
close to her in your class?</font>

477
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,890
<font color="yellow">Or anyone who fought
for her attention?</font>

478
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,370
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't know anything about it.</font>

479
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,080
<font color="yellow">I took over the class
in the middle of the semester.</font>

480
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,600
<font color="yellow">I don't have any personal
information on the students.</font>

481
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,310
<font color="yellow">We were told that.</font>

482
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,560
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your time.</font>

483
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,660
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

484
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,330
<font color="yellow">If you think of anything</font>

485
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,680
<font color="yellow">please call this number.</font>

486
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,310
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

487
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,580
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- No problem.</font>

488
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,710
<font color="yellow">Oh my, it's hot.</font>

489
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,020
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Nothing.</font>

490
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,160
<font color="yellow">Just go in there!</font>

491
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,580
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
- Shoot.</font>

492
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,460
<font color="yellow">There's a rock between my toes.</font>

493
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,710
<font color="yellow">We've come all the way here
and you're not going to jump in?</font>

494
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,230
<font color="yellow">- You're no fun.
- I'm okay here.</font>

495
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,560
<font color="yellow">- It feels cool.
- I'm okay too.</font>

496
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,890
<font color="yellow">There is a whale!</font>

497
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,660
<font color="yellow">What are they doing?</font>

498
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,930
<font color="yellow">Get under the water!</font>

499
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,330
<font color="yellow">Where did you go? Save me!</font>

500
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,640
<font color="yellow">One, two, three, cheese.</font>

501
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,310
<font color="yellow">One, two, three. One, two, three.</font>

502
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,180
<font color="yellow">Hello there.</font>

503
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,870
<font color="yellow">Let's take a group photo
to remember this place.</font>

504
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,560
<font color="yellow">I'd like that.</font>

505
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,270
<font color="yellow">- I'm okay.
- What do you mean?</font>

506
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,560
<font color="yellow">Come this way. Come over here.</font>

507
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,290
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

508
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,350
<font color="yellow">Now I will take one for you.</font>

509
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,910
<font color="yellow">In Rang, what are you doing?</font>

510
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,790
<font color="yellow">- You said you'd take a photo of us.
- You're slow, aren't you?</font>

511
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,060
<font color="yellow">There.</font>

512
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,680
<font color="yellow">Get closer to each other.</font>

513
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,890
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

514
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,580
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get closer.</font>

515
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,700
<font color="yellow">Such a Seoulite.</font>

516
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,390
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

517
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:59,500
<font color="yellow">- No, no. Your hair was a bit messy...
- Your hair was...</font>

518
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:05,120
<font color="yellow">Look here. Bong Pal,
what are you doing? One, two, three.</font>

519
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,430
<font color="yellow"><i>[RESTRICTED AREA]</i></font>

520
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,450
<font color="yellow">You go there.</font>

521
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,580
<font color="yellow">Senior, what's the matter?</font>

522
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,680
<font color="yellow">You have no appetite?</font>

523
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,140
<font color="yellow">About Professor Joo Hye Sung...</font>

524
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,120
<font color="yellow">- You have his information, don't you?
- Yes.</font>

525
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,960
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

526
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,460
<font color="yellow">By the way, what about
that professor all of a sudden?</font>

527
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,140
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I'm just curious.</font>

528
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,140
<font color="yellow">Joo Hye Sung is 30 years old.</font>

529
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,850
<font color="yellow">He's the youngest professor
in the Department of Veterinary Medicine.</font>

530
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,700
<font color="yellow">He was the owner of
a well-known animal clinic in Gangnam.</font>

531
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,350
<font color="yellow">And he recently started
a small clinic near the university.</font>

532
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:14,310
<font color="yellow">And he was offered a very good position
before he took the job at Myungsung.</font>

533
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,600
<font color="yellow">- Like what?
- He was offered a teaching job at</font>

534
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,480
<font color="yellow">a very prestigious university overseas.</font>

535
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,750
<font color="yellow">So he was getting ready to leave.</font>

536
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,270
<font color="yellow">But he changed his plans
at the last minute.</font>

537
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,890
<font color="yellow">He came to teach at Myungsung instead.
Myungsung is one of the good schools.</font>

538
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,520
<font color="yellow">Why did he turn down
such a good position?</font>

539
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,930
<font color="yellow">He closed down his booming business.</font>

540
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,870
<font color="yellow">Why did he come here?</font>

541
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,040
<font color="yellow">It's close to the university.</font>

542
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,000
<font color="yellow">Or he didn't want to live abroad.</font>

543
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
<font color="yellow"><i>[HONG MYUNG HEE]</i></font>

544
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,140
<font color="yellow"><i>[HONG MYUNG HEE]</i></font>

545
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,000
<font color="yellow">- In Rang.
- Yes?</font>

546
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,080
<font color="yellow">Can you turn up the volume?</font>

547
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,620
<font color="yellow">It's too high.</font>

548
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,060
<font color="yellow">It's good now. It's perfect.</font>

549
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,770
<font color="yellow">I know how busy you are
with school and job hunting.</font>

550
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,930
<font color="yellow">But you managed to come.</font>

551
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:14,410
<font color="yellow">For that, I want to thank you,
new members.</font>

552
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,540
<font color="yellow">This trip is celebrating the foundation
of Blood Sausage Soup</font>

553
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:24,310
<font color="yellow">and we welcome you to join in
this variety show for our retreat.</font>

554
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,430
<font color="yellow">By the way, why is the name of
the club Blood Sausage Soup?</font>

555
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,080
<font color="yellow">Well, that's because...</font>

556
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,870
<font color="yellow">When you're tired and things are tough</font>

557
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:45,210
<font color="yellow">a bowl of blood sausage soup
can warm you up.</font>

558
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,870
<font color="yellow">Like the bowls at the restaurants
sizzling 24-7 all year</font>

559
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:56,180
<font color="yellow">we thought we could be something
warm for those who struggle.</font>

560
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,870
<font color="yellow">And that restaurant was where
we all decided to work together.</font>

561
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,600
<font color="yellow">He may become a scam artist one day.</font>

562
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:18,200
<font color="yellow">Now, before we start,
let's sing our national anthem or not.</font>

563
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,040
<font color="yellow">Let's play games first!</font>

564
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,640
<font color="yellow">- Let's go!
- Hurray!</font>

565
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,350
<font color="yellow">Drink up!</font>

566
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,640
<font color="yellow">Until you drink up, I will dance.</font>

567
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,210
<font color="yellow">Look at my shoulder.</font>

568
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,680
<font color="yellow">I'm pouring you more.</font>

569
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,790
<font color="yellow">- One.
- Two.</font>

570
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,410
<font color="yellow">- Four.
- Five.</font>

571
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,140
<font color="yellow">- Seven.
- Eight.</font>

572
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,080
<font color="yellow">- 10.
- 11.</font>

573
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,500
<font color="yellow">- 12.
- 14.</font>

574
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,840
<font color="yellow">- 16.
- 17.</font>

575
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,210
<font color="yellow">18.</font>

576
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,080
<font color="yellow">19, 20, 21.</font>

577
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,710
<font color="yellow">22, 23, 24.</font>

578
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,770
<font color="yellow">- 25, 26, 27.
- 28, 29, 30.</font>

579
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:08,910
<font color="yellow">- Drink up!
- Drink up!</font>

580
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,430
<font color="yellow">I say blood sausage and you say soup.</font>

581
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,600
<font color="yellow">- Blood Sausage.
- Soup.</font>

582
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,390
<font color="yellow">You're doing it well.</font>

583
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,350
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time.</font>

584
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,710
<font color="yellow">Oh my, it's me again.</font>

585
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,330
<font color="yellow">It's me again.</font>

586
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,520
<font color="yellow">If you have any questions,
ask me now.</font>

587
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,790
<font color="yellow">I will answer all your questions.
In Rang, go ahead.</font>

588
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,180
<font color="yellow">- Me?
- Yes.</font>

589
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,750
<font color="yellow">I want to ask...</font>

590
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,750
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Time's up.</font>

591
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,730
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal, how about you?
- I don't really have any.</font>

592
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,210
<font color="yellow">Forget you then.</font>

593
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:23,540
<font color="yellow">Im Seo Yeon, if you have
any questions, ask me now.</font>

594
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,770
<font color="yellow">- I will answer all your questions.
- Well...</font>

595
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,600
<font color="yellow">Well, what is your last name?</font>

596
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,060
<font color="yellow">It's Choi. Choi from Ohkyung.</font>

597
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,580
<font color="yellow">It's Choi of
the 35th generation from Ohkyung.</font>

598
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,600
<font color="yellow">It's C-H-O-I in English.
Choi is my last name.</font>

599
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,620
<font color="yellow">35th generation?</font>

600
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,040
<font color="yellow">Now we will do it again, okay?</font>

601
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:49,850
<font color="yellow">- Now, it's your turn, Im Seo Yeon.
- Im Seo Yeon.</font>

602
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:59,290
<font color="yellow">Well, is there someone
you like these days, Im Seo Yeon?</font>

603
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, there is.</font>

604
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,100
<font color="yellow">There is someone she likes.</font>

605
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,790
<font color="yellow">I'm dying to know who it is.</font>

606
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,890
<font color="yellow">Any questions?</font>

607
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,460
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

608
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,140
<font color="yellow">Oh my, that's an angel.</font>

609
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,540
<font color="yellow">- She's an angel.
- An angel is here.</font>

610
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,210
<font color="yellow">- There is an angel here.
- Go to sleep.</font>

611
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,210
<font color="yellow">You're really hurt here, huh?</font>

612
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:50,410
<font color="yellow">Fine then.</font>

613
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,160
<font color="yellow">I will ask for In Rang now.</font>

614
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,390
<font color="yellow">Is the one you like here with us?</font>

615
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,960
<font color="yellow">No, he isn't.</font>

616
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,020
<font color="yellow">He isn't?</font>

617
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,080
<font color="yellow">Well, then let's turn this again.</font>

618
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:20,060
<font color="yellow">Well, do you like him a lot?</font>

619
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,160
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

620
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,790
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

621
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,870
<font color="yellow">Can I spin the bottle now?</font>

622
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,730
<font color="yellow">It's you, Bong Pal.
It's your turn.</font>

623
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,330
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, is there someone you like?</font>

624
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,830
<font color="yellow">He drank because he was sad.</font>

625
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,810
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to answer,
you should drink.</font>

626
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,230
<font color="yellow">Let me go to the bathroom.</font>

627
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,950
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

628
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:17,370
<font color="yellow">How can you leave
in the middle of the game?</font>

629
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:20,230
<font color="yellow">I will also go out to get some air.</font>

630
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,790
<font color="yellow">How can you leave us here?</font>

631
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:25,060
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed
to do without you two?</font>

632
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,460
<font color="yellow">You're being too loud.
You need to quiet down.</font>

633
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:31,140
<font color="yellow">I will play this game by myself then.</font>

634
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:39,580
<font color="yellow"><i>From what I see, I think you like him.</i></font>

635
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:48,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

636
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,450
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

637
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,090
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

638
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,850
<font color="yellow">Seo Yeon!</font>

639
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,180
<font color="yellow">Get her! Get her.</font>

640
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,620
<font color="yellow">Get her.</font>

641
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:21,020
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?</font>

642
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,520
<font color="yellow">- What happened?
- I don't know.</font>

643
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:29,080
<font color="yellow">It felt like someone was pulling
me down from the water.</font>

644
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,100
<font color="yellow">- I might have tripped then.
- Oh my.</font>

645
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,230
<font color="yellow">Oh my, you're bleeding here.</font>

646
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,950
<font color="yellow">We don't have any medicine.</font>

647
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,710
<font color="yellow">I will go get some.</font>

648
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,100
<font color="yellow">I told you not to play around, didn't I?</font>

649
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,960
<font color="yellow">- Seo Yeon is hurt because of you.
- Because of me?</font>

650
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,250
<font color="yellow">I didn't do that.</font>

651
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,140
<font color="yellow">You were the only one next to her.
Who else would have done that?</font>

652
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,930
<font color="yellow">- I already said it wasn't me.
- I don't believe you.</font>

653
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,580
<font color="yellow">You've been after her since yesterday.</font>

654
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,830
<font color="yellow">Why are you messing with her?</font>

655
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,120
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with messing with her?</font>

656
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,330
<font color="yellow">I did that to get back at you.</font>

657
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,450
<font color="yellow">Are you acting this way
because I didn't take care of you?</font>

658
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,450
<font color="yellow">This is why I told you to stay home.</font>

659
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,660
<font color="yellow">This is so immature!</font>

660
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,930
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for acting immature.</font>

661
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,790
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have followed you here.</font>

662
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:44,200
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?</font>

663
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,390
<font color="yellow">- Is there a pharmacy around here?
- Why? Is someone hurt?</font>

664
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:50,540
<font color="yellow">She was in the water and got scratched.</font>

665
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,390
<font color="yellow">You guys have a lot of
energy in the morning.</font>

666
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,540
<font color="yellow">Is it because you're young?</font>

667
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,480
<font color="yellow">Did you guys play
behind the villa by any chance?</font>

668
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,850
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Why did you play there?</font>

669
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:05,500
<font color="yellow">There is a sign telling people
not to play in the water there.</font>

670
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,460
<font color="yellow">- You didn't see it?
- No, we didn't.</font>

671
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,980
<font color="yellow">It's notorious there.</font>

672
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,640
<font color="yellow">Even my grandmother almost
died there when she was little.</font>

673
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,790
<font color="yellow">A ghost from the water appears there.</font>

674
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:20,250
<font color="yellow">- So many people have died there.
- That's right.</font>

675
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,540
<font color="yellow">Don't ever play in the water there.</font>

676
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,540
<font color="yellow">Kiddo!</font>

677
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,250
<font color="yellow">Was it because of me?</font>

678
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,660
<font color="yellow">- I didn't do it.
- You were the only one next to her.</font>

679
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,230
<font color="yellow">- Who else would have done it?
