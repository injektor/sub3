<font color="yellow">Yes, the appointment was canceled.
Everything's fine?</font>

17
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:18,892
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

18
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:22,614
<font color="yellow">Ah, Director.
Someone is here to see you.</font>

19
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:33,280
<font color="yellow">Goodness, the professor is here.</font>

20
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:38,619
<font color="yellow">This is not the bathroom.</font>

21
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:42,529
<font color="yellow">- I think you're lost.
- No kidding.</font>

22
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:45,553
<font color="yellow">I went into the wrong room.</font>

23
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,689
<font color="yellow">Excuse me then.</font>

24
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:01,943
<font color="yellow">Monk.</font>

25
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,096
<font color="yellow">- Did you not come here to see me?
- Ah, yes.</font>

26
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:22,370
<font color="yellow">I came to ask if Bong Pal
was doing well in school.</font>

27
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,097
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

28
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:32,934
<font color="yellow">Yes. Bong Pal is doing very well.</font>

29
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:36,754
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

30
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:42,377
<font color="yellow">That rascal is not very social,
so I was a bit worried.</font>

31
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:43,830
<font color="yellow">Monk.</font>

32
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,017
<font color="yellow">Would you like to hear
something interesting?</font>

33
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:53,111
<font color="yellow">Several days ago, I went down to
the countryside to rescue a cat.</font>

34
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:58,259
<font color="yellow">I went to the site, and that cat was
trapped inside a small ventilator.</font>

35
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,983
<font color="yellow">There was noise coming from it, so it
probably went inside out of curiosity.</font>

36
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:03,512
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

37
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:09,752
<font color="yellow">it went in so deep that
it couldn't get out.</font>

38
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,361
<font color="yellow">Despite all the pain, that cat...</font>

39
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:23,353
<font color="yellow">kept going inside deeper
and deeper to follow the noise.</font>

40
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,022
<font color="yellow">So do you know what happened?</font>

41
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:35,325
<font color="yellow">Ultimately, it couldn't breathe...</font>

42
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,147
<font color="yellow">and died a painful death.</font>

43
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,861
<font color="yellow">That's not a interesting story.</font>

44
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:53,303
<font color="yellow">You think so? I thought it was.
And there's a lesson to be learned.</font>

45
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:56,327
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be the one
to give you any advice...</font>

46
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:59,771
<font color="yellow">but I'll say some words
of wisdom from Buddha.</font>

47
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:08,753
<font color="yellow">"He who delights in evil will never
be free from his grudge and hatred."</font>

48
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:17,414
<font color="yellow">If you have a heart filled with anger,
karma will come and get you someday.</font>

49
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:22,517
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the words of wisdom.
- You're welcome.</font>

50
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:25,159
<font color="yellow">Please keep them close to your heart.</font>

51
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:30,848
<font color="yellow">You see, nothing and no one
is an exception to the rule.</font>

52
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:36,784
<font color="yellow">Whether that's an animal or a ghost.</font>

53
00:05:57,454 --> 00:05:59,255
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

54
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:01,116
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

55
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:07,837
<font color="yellow">- You have a guest from next door.
- Ah, I see. I'll be right there.</font>

56
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:08,837
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

57
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,146
<font color="yellow">Monk.</font>

58
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,937
<font color="yellow">I'll keep your words in mind.</font>

59
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:42,310
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

60
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:22,372
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry for coming so late at night.
- That's okay.</font>

61
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:26,372
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- Ah, well...</font>

62
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:31,801
<font color="yellow">I want to ask you some questions
about what happened 18 years ago.</font>

63
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,192
<font color="yellow">Is it true that
your husband died from an accident?</font>

64
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:43,865
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past.
Why are you asking?</font>

65
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:46,795
<font color="yellow">I know the case is closed.</font>

66
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:49,408
<font color="yellow">There were several things
I noticed that I found strange.</font>

67
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:53,014
<font color="yellow">You were inside the house with
your husband at that time, correct?</font>

68
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,014
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

69
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,945
<font color="yellow">How could you not know
about his accident then?</font>

70
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:01,272
<font color="yellow">- I thought he went outside.
- Ah.</font>

71
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,002
<font color="yellow">I went to the site of the
accident during the day earlier.</font>

72
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:06,367
<font color="yellow">Your husband and I are
about the same height.</font>

73
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:07,994
<font color="yellow">When I was standing
out on the veranda</font>

74
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:11,150
<font color="yellow">I noticed it would've been difficult
to fall over the railing even by mistake.</font>

75
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,839
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

76
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:21,360
<font color="yellow">I think someone pushed
him over from behind.</font>

77
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:28,190
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo Hye Sung was also inside
the house at the time, wasn't he?</font>

78
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,275
<font color="yellow">What was he doing at that moment?</font>

79
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:32,864
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

80
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:37,993
<font color="yellow">Please leave now.
I have nothing more to say to you.</font>

81
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:39,195
<font color="yellow">Ah.</font>

82
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,969
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

83
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:46,871
<font color="yellow">If I can ask you one more question...</font>

84
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:51,090
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for bothering you.</font>

85
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:54,628
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

86
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,700
<font color="yellow">How is she doing?</font>

87
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,994
<font color="yellow">Her breathing is stable,
so there's nothing to worry about.</font>

88
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,864
<font color="yellow">- She's fine, right?
- Yes.</font>

89
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:30,723
<font color="yellow">She just had a temporary mental shock.
She'll wake up once she's stable.</font>

90
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:35,672
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

91
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:45,074
<font color="yellow">You may leave now.</font>

92
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,276
<font color="yellow">Yes, ma'am.</font>

93
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:55,179
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.
This is Hyun Ji's cell phone.</font>

94
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,229
<font color="yellow">I'll be on my way.</font>

95
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:23,818
<font color="yellow">Kim Hyun Ji? Why is her student ID here?</font>

96
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:26,700
<font color="yellow">Just how is she connected to that punk?</font>

97
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:52,300
<font color="yellow"><i>[Kim Hyun Ji]</i></font>

98
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:08,550
<font color="yellow"><i>Please go home now! Let me work!</i></font>

99
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:12,470
<font color="yellow">- Please help us, Detective.
- Yes, please help us.</font>

100
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,290
<font color="yellow">Seriously, you two are driving me nuts!</font>

101
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,570
<font color="yellow">- You're here.
- What's going on?</font>

102
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:25,145
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, sir.
Detective, please help us.</font>

103
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:27,698
<font color="yellow">Please catch the punk that
hurt our friend Hyun Ji.</font>

104
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,368
<font color="yellow">Who are these kids?</font>

105
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:32,735
<font color="yellow">They've been here for hours begging me
to catch a hit-and-run criminal.</font>

106
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:34,400
<font color="yellow">- That's enough.
- Wait.</font>

107
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:37,044
<font color="yellow">You guys are the kids
from the cyberbully case.</font>

108
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:41,209
<font color="yellow">He remembers us!
But we were not the cyberbully.</font>

109
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,329
<font color="yellow">We called you in the afternoon too.</font>

110
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,849
<font color="yellow">Were you the ones
who called me 11 times?</font>

111
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:46,338
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

112
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:53,253
<font color="yellow">- Tell me what the case is about.
- Yes, so....</font>

113
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:58,983
<font color="yellow">I have a really beautiful friend.</font>

114
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,416
<font color="yellow">She's like an angel.</font>

115
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:02,448
<font color="yellow">Nothing like that. What's her name?</font>

116
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,079
<font color="yellow">Her name is Kim Hyun Ji and she
was a victim of a hit-and-run accident.</font>

117
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:08,075
<font color="yellow">She was in a coma for five years
and woke up not too long ago.</font>

118
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:11,950
<font color="yellow">She's awake,
but she doesn't remember anything.</font>

119
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,814
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for her
and Bong Pal, Detective.</font>

120
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:20,685
<font color="yellow">It's very important that you catch the
criminal. Please catch him, Detective.</font>

121
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:24,786
<font color="yellow">It's the hit-and-run accident that
happened five years ago in Seokjongdong.</font>

122
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:28,752
<font color="yellow">I contacted traffic control
and there were no witnesses.</font>

123
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:31,275
<font color="yellow">- The case was suspended.
- It was suspended?</font>

124
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:32,854
<font color="yellow">The case was suspended?</font>

125
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:35,491
<font color="yellow">My friend is in the hospital
struggling to regain her memories--</font>

126
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,200
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got the gist of it.
You can go home now.</font>

127
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:39,778
<font color="yellow">No, I will not go home!</font>

128
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,917
<font color="yellow">Detective, I request
a reinvestigation...</font>

129
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,478
<font color="yellow">If you guys keep this up, I'm going to
charge you for disruption and detain you!</font>

130
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:48,895
<font color="yellow">We'll wait for you to call us.</font>

131
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:51,964
<font color="yellow">Please promise us that
you'll reinvestigate the case...</font>

132
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,685
<font color="yellow">Look, that's not up to us, okay?</font>

133
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:57,381
<font color="yellow">There's no proper witness!</font>

134
00:12:57,382 --> 00:13:01,046
<font color="yellow">I swear, how many times
must I repeat this to you?</font>

135
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,919
<font color="yellow">Come here and get them out of here!</font>

136
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,531
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

137
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:09,569
<font color="yellow">- Just a moment please.
- Il Rang, that's enough.</font>

138
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:16,028
<font color="yellow">No, wait a minute! Detective,
you have to catch that punk! Please!</font>

139
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,762
<font color="yellow">I request a reinvestigation!
Detective, I request a reinvestigation!</font>

140
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,179
<font color="yellow">Please reconsider.</font>

141
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:24,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm exhausted.</font>

142
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:29,984
<font color="yellow">By the way, the chief
wants to see you tomorrow.</font>

143
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:32,369
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Why do you think?</font>

144
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:35,499
<font color="yellow">You keep digging stuff up on
Professor Joo Hye Sung and he's noticed.</font>

145
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:40,967
<font color="yellow">Nothing is going my way
and I keep getting complaints.</font>

146
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:47,456
<font color="yellow"><i>Bong Pal.</i></font>

147

00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,214
<font color="yellow"><i>Bong Pal.</i></font>

150
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:08,489
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

151
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,331
<font color="yellow">Why did you drink so much?</font>

152
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,193
<font color="yellow">Well, I just wanted to.</font>

153
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:23,997
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.
- Yes?</font>

154
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,874
<font color="yellow">Come here and give me a kiss.</font>

155
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:29,911
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?
You're grossing me out!</font>

156
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:34,536
<font color="yellow">You gave me so many kisses when
you were this little. Come here.</font>

157
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,829
<font color="yellow">Forget it! I'm not a child anymore.</font>

158
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:40,049
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I'm not a child.</font>

159
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,488
<font color="yellow">Come and lie down.</font>

160
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:45,799
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you've gotten big.</font>

161
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:50,352
<font color="yellow">- You're all grown up.
- I'll get you some tea.</font>

162
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:52,521
<font color="yellow">No, that's okay.</font>

163
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:58,960
<font color="yellow">No, tea. How about a cup of water?
Get me a cup of water.</font>

164
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,996
<font color="yellow">Oh goodness.</font>

165
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:25,430
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

166
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:29,390
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, I'm sorry.</font>

167
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:34,073
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, I'm sorry.</font>

168
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,344
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

169
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,095
<font color="yellow">- You're awake?
- Yes.</font>

170
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:02,623
<font color="yellow">- And you're fine?
- Yes, I'm fine.</font>

171
00:16:02,623 --> 00:16:04,492
<font color="yellow">You mean it?</font>

172
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:09,050
<font color="yellow">Speak up if something
doesn't feel right, okay?</font>

173
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,512
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

174
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,993
<font color="yellow">What happened?
Why did you suddenly pass out?</font>

175
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:19,685
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

176
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:24,373
<font color="yellow">I saw something scary and I think
I fainted from the shock of it.</font>

177
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:33,955
<font color="yellow">But what about Bong Pal?
Did he leave?</font>

178
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:37,369
<font color="yellow">Hey! You don't know what kind of
person he is. Don't get too close to him.</font>

179
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,011
<font color="yellow">- Why? He's a good person.
- How do you know that?</font>

180
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,231
<font color="yellow">The world is a scary place.</font>

181
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,432
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

182
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:48,414
<font color="yellow">- You weren't mean to him, were you?
- What?</font>

183
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:52,037
<font color="yellow">- What would I possibly say to him?
- Don't be mean to him.</font>

184
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:56,260
<font color="yellow">He has nothing to do
with me passing out.</font>

185
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,223
<font color="yellow">If anything, he helped me.</font>

186
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,551
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about him anymore.</font>

187
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:07,004
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go see the doctor.</font>

188
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,055
<font color="yellow">Can you be alone for a moment?</font>

189
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:10,661
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

190
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:26,365
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal!
- Are you okay?</font>

191
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:31,611
<font color="yellow">What did I see that time?</font>

192
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:34,578
<font color="yellow">Was it a ghost?</font>

193
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:41,771
<font color="yellow">Why did I call for Bong Pal?</font>

194
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,594
<font color="yellow">Did we really know each other?</font>

195
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:49,729
<font color="yellow">Oh, I don't know.</font>

196
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,207
<font color="yellow"><i>[Amnesia]</i></font>

197
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:25,729
<font color="yellow"><i>[Are you okay?]</i></font>

198
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:40,924
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you okay?</i></font>

199
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:44,668
<font color="yellow">When did he change his caller ID?</font>

200
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,236
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, I feel much better now.</i></font>

201
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:59,071
<font color="yellow"><i>That's a relief. I was worried.</i></font>

202
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,440
<font color="yellow">Yeah right.</font>

203
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,837
<font color="yellow"><i>Thanks for saving me earlier.
Did you get hurt?</i></font>

204
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,174
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm fine.</i></font>

205
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:12,210
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm glad to hear that,
but what did I see?</i></font>

206
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,651
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll tell you later.</i></font>

207
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:23,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay.</i></font>

208
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:27,971
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm being discharged tomorrow.
You can come if you want to.</i></font>

209
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:30,855
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay, I'll come.</i></font>

210
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:36,057
<font color="yellow"><i>[Good night]</i></font>

211
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,831
<font color="yellow"><i>Good night.</i></font>

212
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,567
<font color="yellow"><i>You too.</i></font>

213
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,056
<font color="yellow">Do you know what time it is?
Hurry up and go to bed.</font>

214
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:56,833
<font color="yellow">- Okay. After I send this.
- That's enough.</font>

215
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,536
<font color="yellow">I'm not a kid. Give it back.</font>

216
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,497
<font color="yellow">You're not a kid,
but you're still a patient.</font>

217
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:03,636
<font color="yellow">If I see you messing with your
cell phone late at night again</font>

218
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:05,424
<font color="yellow">I'm really going to confiscate it.</font>

219
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:07,807
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

220
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,716
<font color="yellow">Good night, Mom. Bye.</font>

221
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,640
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

222
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,604
<font color="yellow"><i>Bong Pal, are you sleeping?</i></font>

223
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:50,765
<font color="yellow"><i>- No, not yet.
- What were you doing?</i></font>

224
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:59,289
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm just here. Aren't you sleeping?
It's after 2:00 a.m.</i></font>

225
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:03,578
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm going to sleep in a little bit.</i></font>

226
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,758
<font color="yellow"><i>When are you being discharged tomorrow?</i></font>

227
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:08,969
<font color="yellow"><i>In the morning.</i></font>

228
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
<font color="yellow"><i>[You too. Sleep well.]</i></font>

229
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:48,121
<font color="yellow"><i>[Sleep well.]</i></font>

230
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:35,313
<font color="yellow">Monk Myung Chul.</font>

231
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:37,164
<font color="yellow">Monk Myung Chul.</font>

232
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,816
<font color="yellow">I made some bean sprout soup. Eat it.</font>

233
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:45,473
<font color="yellow">Where are you going this morning?</font>

234
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:48,119
<font color="yellow">To the hospital.
Hyun Ji is being discharged.</font>

235
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,707
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

236
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,801
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

237
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:54,495
<font color="yellow">- Tell her congratulations.
- Sure. I'll see you later.</font>

238
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:55,934
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

239
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,905
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if it's okay for
those two to continue to see each other.</font>

240
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,526
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

241
00:23:34,824 --> 00:23:37,325
<font color="yellow">- Is it a gift for someone?
- Yes.</font>

242
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:38,809
<font color="yellow">Your girlfriend?</font>

243
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:39,811
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

244
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,882
<font color="yellow">Would you like to see this product?</font>

245
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,872
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Sure.</font>

246
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,659
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

247
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:57,148
<font color="yellow">It's a necklace designed to have
the meaning of destiny behind it.</font>

248
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:01,018
<font color="yellow">- I'll take it.
- Okay.</font>

249
00:24:14,971 --> 00:24:16,072
<font color="yellow">Student.</font>

250
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,395
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

251
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:23,741
<font color="yellow">By any chance, did you
come to see Hyun Ji?</font>

252
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,152
<font color="yellow">Yes. I heard she's
being discharged today.</font>

253
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:29,518
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but just go home.</font>

254
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:33,006
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me?
- I don't know what your relationship</font>

255
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,723
<font color="yellow">is with her,
but I don't like you coming here.</font>

256
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:39,307
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji passed out while
she was with you yesterday.</font>

257
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,451
<font color="yellow">It's been five years since she woke up.</font>

258
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:46,578
<font color="yellow">Yesterday's incident
can never happen again.</font>

259
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:50,902
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Please leave.</font>

260
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:13,728
<font color="yellow">The results... are very good.</font>

261
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,867
<font color="yellow">- You can leave.
- Yes!</font>

262
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:19,180
<font color="yellow">Mom, I can go home!</font>

263
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:22,930
<font color="yellow">But will she be okay
from fainting yesterday?</font>

264
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,479
<font color="yellow">That's called a vasovagal syncope.</font>

265
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,914
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji was in a coma
for a very long time</font>

266
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:31,807
<font color="yellow">so it's hard to say
if she's mentally stable.</font>

267
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:34,633
<font color="yellow">In instances like that, when
a sudden emotional change occurs...</font>

268
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:38,439
<font color="yellow">something like yesterday can
happen due to sensory overload.</font>

269
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,814
<font color="yellow">What should we do if something
like that happens again?</font>

270
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:45,121
<font color="yellow">Vasovagal syncope occurs frequently
in even normal young adults.</font>

271
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:47,485
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't worry so much.</font>

272
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:52,235
<font color="yellow">As long as you continue your treatments,
something like yesterday won't occur.</font>

273
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:56,378
<font color="yellow">You must come twice a week for
mental and physical therapy.</font>

274
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:58,251
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Hello.</font>

275
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,698
<font color="yellow">- I'm a little late.
- You're here.</font>

276
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:03,979
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo will be in charge of
Miss Hyun Ji's psychological treatment.</font>

277
00:26:04,923 --> 00:26:07,389
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Congratulations on your discharge.</font>

278
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,097
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

279
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:12,372
<font color="yellow">He's a veterinary professor who helps
us out in the psychology department.</font>

280
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:15,437
<font color="yellow">He's very popular in
the animal therapy field.</font>

281
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:17,363
<font color="yellow">- Oh.
- He's quite a busy person</font>

282
00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:21,495
<font color="yellow">but he personally volunteered to take
Miss Hyun Ji on once he heard the story.</font>

283
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:25,009
<font color="yellow">Thank you.
You also helped us out last time.</font>

284
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,263
<font color="yellow">I can't believe
we're meeting like this again.</font>

285
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:30,255
<font color="yellow">- Not at all.
- Do you two know each other?</font>

286
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,359
<font color="yellow">That's perfect.</font>

287
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,909
<font color="yellow">What about her father?</font>

288
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:37,888
<font color="yellow">He's busy, but he'll
be home later tonight.</font>

289
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:41,295
<font color="yellow">What should we do with
all her belongings?</font>

290
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:44,905
<font color="yellow">I'll help her since
she's also my patient now.</font>

291
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:45,936
<font color="yellow">That's great then.</font>

292
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:48,805
<font color="yellow">Your recovery will be faster
the sooner you get to know one another.

293
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:54,146
<font color="yellow">Well, you don't really have to do that,
but if you insist on helping us out...</font>

294
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:57,293
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- What?</font>

295
00:26:57,294 --> 00:27:00,905
<font color="yellow">He said he'll help us.
It would be rude to refuse him.</font>

296
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:03,092
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that right?
- Yes, that's correct.</font>

297
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:27,315
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you.</font>

298
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:29,778
<font color="yellow">- We're going to get going.
- Take it easy.</font>

299
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:31,809
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- Let's go.</font>

300
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,773
<font color="yellow">What the heck?
He said he would come.</font>

301
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,526
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

302
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:48,982
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

303
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,819
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'm going to drive now.</font>

304
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,280
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

305
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,641
<font color="yellow">Yes. Are you leaving?</font>

306
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:25,794
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm going to step out for a bit.</font>

307
00:28:26,478 --> 00:28:28,154
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to the
hospital. Why are you back so early?</font>

308
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:29,947
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

309
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,164
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Hyun Ji's discharge gift?</font>

310
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:37,970
<font color="yellow">I'll give it to her next time.</font>

311
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:40,431
<font color="yellow">- Did her memories return?
- No.</font>

312
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:45,853
<font color="yellow">I don't think she remembers
the time when she was a ghost.</font>

313
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:49,275
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

314
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,771
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't say this for your sake.</font>

315
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,856
<font color="yellow">But it might be better if
her memories don't return.</font>

316
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:00,264
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

317
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:02,319
<font color="yellow">What good is it to remember
her time as a ghost?</font>

318
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:05,353
<font color="yellow">She would be so scared if
she knew she was near death.</font>

319
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:10,218
<font color="yellow">I'm sure every day was a nightmare
being near those dangerous ghosts.</font>

320
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,542
<font color="yellow">It's better not to remember.</font>

321
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,386
<font color="yellow">She's human now.
She deserves to have a normal life.</font>

322
00:29:17,386 --> 00:29:21,446
<font color="yellow">You don't know how it will affect
her if she finds out the truth.</font>

323
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:24,519
<font color="yellow">It will be difficult for you</font>

324
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,161
<font color="yellow">but I don't think it's a bad idea
for you to help her live a new life.</font>

325
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:34,636
<font color="yellow">In order for Hyun Ji to move on,
you need to let go of her hand first.</font>

326
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,438
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

327
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:43,238
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

328
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:02,586
<font color="yellow">- Have your memories returned?
- No, not yet.</font>

329
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:05,725
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you went there.</font>

330
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,316
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- Someone asked her to do a favor.</font>

331
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:15,173
<font color="yellow">She went to some unknown academy and got
into a car accident right in front of it.</font>

332
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:18,401
<font color="yellow">Just from whom and what kind
of favor did you accept?</font>

333
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,380
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I don't remember.</font>

334
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:22,689
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I don't know who it was</font>

335
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,027
<font color="yellow">but it was all for nothing
and that person ruined your life.</font>

336
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:28,648
<font color="yellow">It's your fault too!
You're too kind for your own good.</font>

337
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:30,603
<font color="yellow">You're always helping people out.</font>

338
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:34,123
<font color="yellow">Why did you go all the
way to Seoul to do that?</font>

339
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:37,574
<font color="yellow">It's good to be kind.</font>

340
00:30:37,575 --> 00:30:39,109
<font color="yellow">Oh please!</font>

341
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:46,930
<font color="yellow">Anyway, that's another story, but the
hit-and-run criminal is even worse.</font>

342
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,271
<font color="yellow">I hope that evil jerk
gets what he deserves.</font>

343
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:12,713
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave now.</font>

344
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:15,577
<font color="yellow">Thank you. We were able to come
home comfortably because of you.</font>

345
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:18,400
<font color="yellow">I would love to treat
you to a hot cup of tea.</font>

346
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:21,367
<font color="yellow">- I feel so bad.
- We can do it next time.</font>

347
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,271
<font color="yellow">I'll call you to
schedule our appointments.</font>

348
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:26,144
<font color="yellow">- Yes, goodbye.
- Goodbye.</font>

349
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:29,024
<font color="yellow">Drive safely.</font>

350
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:34,296
<font color="yellow">Wow, he is one decent guy.</font>

351
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:37,804
<font color="yellow">- I told you he's pretty cool.
- I know.</font>

352
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:42,707
<font color="yellow">- Is this place our home now?
- No.</font>

353
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,915
<font color="yellow">We lived here temporarily
because of you.</font>

354
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:49,382
<font color="yellow">Let's pack up and leave soon.
Your father is by himself too.</font>

355
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:51,438
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

356
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:54,257
<font color="yellow">- All the boxes are still here.
- Of course.</font>

357
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:58,129
<font color="yellow">How could I unpack when you were
lying in the hospital like that?</font>

358
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,727
<font color="yellow">Go to your room.</font>

359
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:03,518
<font color="yellow">I made sure it is in perfect condition.</font>

360
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,701
<font color="yellow">- It's on the second floor.
- Really?</font>

361
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:12,955
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's exactly like my old room.</font>

362
00:32:16,245 --> 00:32:17,753
<font color="yellow">Oh my, what's all this?</font>

363
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,529
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty.</font>

364
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:32,930
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

365
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,340
<font color="yellow">- What do you think? Like it?
- Yes.</font>

366
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:42,509
<font color="yellow">We bought all these
one by one on your birthdays.</font>

367
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:47,049
<font color="yellow">We prayed you'd wear them
when you wake up.</font>

368
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:49,319
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Mom.
- What do you mean?</font>

369
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,140
<font color="yellow">I want to thank you more.</font>

370
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,219
<font color="yellow">- Organize it and come out.
- I will.</font>

371
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:11,029
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Mom.</font>

372
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:13,469
<font color="yellow">You must have worried
so much because of me.</font>

373
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,459
<font color="yellow">I will be a very good daughter.</font>

374
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:17,459
<font color="yellow">I will study hard and go to college.</font>

375
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:19,700
<font color="yellow">I will get a job and give you money too.</font>

376
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,100
<font color="yellow">I don't need you to do any of that.
Just don't get sick.</font>

377
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,499
<font color="yellow">That's all I need.</font>

378
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:29,259
<font color="yellow">No, I will do everything for you
that I couldn't do before.</font>

379
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,069
<font color="yellow">I will kiss you this much too.</font>

380
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:32,890
<font color="yellow">You're too big to do that.</font>

381
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,870
<font color="yellow">I know you like it.</font>

382
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,319
<font color="yellow"><i>Stop it.</i></font>

383
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,450
<font color="yellow">It's now clear that
you had it all this time.</font>

384
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,890
<font color="yellow">What? Reinvestigation?</font>

385
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,230
<font color="yellow">It's been years
since the case was closed.</font>

386
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,540
<font color="yellow">You two have a lot of time
on your hands, huh?</font>

387
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,939
<font color="yellow">When you have time for this,
why don't you do other work?</font>

388
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:12,192
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

389
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:16,739
<font color="yellow">Don't even say a word.
I can't stand you right now, so leave.</font>

390
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,049
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

391
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:27,489
<font color="yellow">How could you tell him that you'd
reinvestigate the case out of the blue?</font>

392
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,680
<font color="yellow">Well, he wouldn't let me
do it even if I ask nicely.</font>

393
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,219
<font color="yellow">It works the same way.</font>

394
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,180
<font color="yellow">I only did that
because he asked me to report.</font>

395
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,140
<font color="yellow">Then will you continue
to investigate the case?</font>

396
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,939
<font color="yellow">I should. Two people,
including No Hyun Joo, were killed.</font>

397
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:41,129
<font color="yellow">We can't just let it go.</font>

398
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:43,719
<font color="yellow">What happened 18 years ago
is also suspicious.</font>

399
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,910
<font color="yellow">I understand, but we don't have
any circumstantial evidence.</font>

400
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,569
<font color="yellow">So we will investigate
until we find evidence.</font>

401
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,370
<font color="yellow">He's so stubborn.</font>

402
00:35:04,049 --> 00:35:05,540
<font color="yellow"><i>[Hyun Ji]</i></font>

403
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,739
<font color="yellow"><i>What are you doing?</i></font>

404
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,989
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he responding?</font>

405
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,169
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, huh?</font>

406
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:47,359
<font color="yellow">You should be studying at this hour.</font>

407
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,549
<font color="yellow">What have you been doing
since last night, huh?</font>

408
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,770
<font color="yellow">If your grandma knew about this,
would she be happy?</font>

409
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,890
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel bad for
Bong Pal and Hyun Ji?</font>

410
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,109
<font color="yellow">I feel bad. I do.</font>

411
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:03,980
<font color="yellow">If you write on a website,
would someone read it?</font>

412
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,640
<font color="yellow">It's been read.</font>

413
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,580
<font color="yellow">- It's been read by one person.
- It was me just now.</font>

414
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,529
<font color="yellow">I should do something.</font>

415
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:15,239
<font color="yellow">How about you?
Do you have a plan?</font>

416
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,020
<font color="yellow">I do. I do have a plan.</font>

417
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,450
<font color="yellow"><i>I have a delivery.
Is Choi Chun Sang here?</i></font>

418
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,450
<font color="yellow">Perfect timing.</font>

419
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:30,910
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's amazing.</font>

420
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,100
<font color="yellow">Now we don't have money
since we can't exorcise.</font>

421
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,919
<font color="yellow">You ordered something.</font>

422
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:37,759
<font color="yellow">Then you'll wipe with your hands
in the bathroom because you're broke?</font>

423
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:40,160
<font color="yellow">There are bare necessities in life.</font>

424
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,589
<font color="yellow">This is toilet paper and tissues.</font>

425
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,180
<font color="yellow">Wow, these are some bare necessities.</font>

426
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,230
<font color="yellow">They are for our leisure.</font>

427
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,350
<font color="yellow">Anyway, that's not what's important.</font>

428
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,219
<font color="yellow">Where could it be?</font>

429
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:06,460
<font color="yellow">Here it is.</font>

430
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:10,799
<font color="yellow">Hey, hold this.</font>

431
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:12,219
<font color="yellow">- Hold it.
- What is it?</font>

432
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:13,850
<font color="yellow">Walk three steps backward.</font>

433
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,089
<font color="yellow">One, two. One, two.</font>

434
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:20,120
<font color="yellow">Do it right. You will be
surprised when you see it.</font>

435
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

436
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
<font color="yellow"><i>[Looking for a witness!]</i></font>

437

00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,450
<font color="yellow">I already printed several more, so</font>

443
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,480
<font color="yellow">- we will go and hang them all over.
- Wow, Chun Sang.</font>

444
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,620
<font color="yellow">- You're so cool.
- You punk!</font>

445
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,879
<font color="yellow">It's me, Chun Sang, punk.</font>

446
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,743
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

447
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,500
<font color="yellow">Are you on your way to class?</font>

448
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,879
<font color="yellow">Yes, where are you two off to?</font>

449
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:26,580
<font color="yellow">- To hang this.
- What is it?</font>

450
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,029
<font color="yellow">It's a banner looking
for Hyun Ji's hit-and-run driver.</font>

451
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:32,160
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang got this all ready.</font>

452
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,379
<font color="yellow">- Have you talked to her?
- Yes.</font>

453
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:42,319
<font color="yellow">- She doesn't have her memories back yet?
- Not yet.</font>

454
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:45,020
<font color="yellow">I wish she'd get her memory back soon...</font>

455
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,450
<font color="yellow">I'd love all four of us to
hang out together like before.</font>

456
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
<font color="yellow">That's Bong Pal.</font>

457
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:15,279
<font color="yellow">That's Bong Pal.</font>

458
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:17,600
<font color="yellow">Park Bong Pal.</font>

459
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,319
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's Hyun Ji.</font>

460
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,730
<font color="yellow">- Wow, she's so pretty.
- Why did she come here?</font>

461
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,589
<font color="yellow">- Did she get her memory back?
- I don't know.</font>

462
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:33,178
<font color="yellow">- Why are you ignoring my text?
- Sorry. I didn't see it.</font>

463
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,732
<font color="yellow">By the way,
what brings you here to school?</font>

464
00:39:35,732 --> 00:39:38,140
<font color="yellow">I came to sit in on
Professor Joo's lecture.</font>

465
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,890
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo?</font>

466
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,200
<font color="yellow">- "Animals and Society"?
- Are you also taking that class?</font>

467
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,480
<font color="yellow">Amazing. Where is the classroom?</font>

468
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,719
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

469
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,890
<font color="yellow">- I will go first.
- Do that.</font>

470
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,410
<font color="yellow">Hi there.</font>

471
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,919
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

472
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:00,169
<font color="yellow">She doesn't seem to
have her memory back, does she?</font>

473
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:05,460
<font color="yellow">No. By the way, why is Bong Pal
acting that way with Hyun Ji?</font>

474
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,000
<font color="yellow">I want my Hyun Ji to be happy.</font>

475
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:12,939
<font color="yellow">My heart started to beat fast...</font>

476
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,879
<font color="yellow">Who are they?</font>

477
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,399
<font color="yellow">- They are my seniors.
- I see.</font>

478
00:40:20,939 --> 00:40:24,969
<font color="yellow">They're not my type,
but they look familiar for some reason.</font>

479
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:28,980
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

480
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,129
<font color="yellow">how do you know Professor Joo?</font>

481
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:35,040
<font color="yellow">He's helping me with
my psychotherapy treatment.</font>

482
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,560
<font color="yellow">- I met him at the hospital.
- Did you?</font>

483
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:46,609
<font color="yellow">- You're here.
- Hello, Professor Joo.</font>

484
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:48,140
<font color="yellow">You found the classroom.</font>

485
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,939
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay to come out today?
- Yes.</font>

486
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:54,899
<font color="yellow">Even my doctor told me to go out more
rather than staying home all day.</font>

487
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,819
<font color="yellow">He told me to practice walking.</font>

488
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,399
<font color="yellow">I didn't realize it at the hospital</font>

489
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:01,009
<font color="yellow">but you sure look like
a college student now.</font>

490
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,480
<font color="yellow">I do?</font>

491
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:07,210
<font color="yellow">By the way, you two know each other?</font>

492
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,830
<font color="yellow">Well, we know each other a little bit.</font>

493
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,790
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

494
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,350
<font color="yellow">- Then shall we go in?
- Sure.</font>

495
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:18,350
<font color="yellow">About my lecture today...</font>

496
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:23,930
<font color="yellow">- Hope you like the class.
- Thank you.</font>

497
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:32,529
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal, hi.
- Senior.</font>

498
00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:35,279
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

499
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,689
<font color="yellow">- She's sitting in today.
- Ah.</font>

500
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:44,370
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

501
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:51,480
<font color="yellow">She's just sitting in?</font>

502
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,120
<font color="yellow">Didn't he say
I was his girlfriend last time?</font>

503
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,270
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt?</font>

504
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,719
<font color="yellow">What happened? Are you hurt?</font>

505
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,649
<font color="yellow">I just got a tiny scratch.</font>

506
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,009
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look tiny.</font>

507
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:07,830
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

508
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,069
<font color="yellow">Did he get injured because of me?</font>

509
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:20,509
<font color="yellow">Animals also have the right
not to be tortured.</font>

510
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:22,000
<font color="yellow">Let's take an example with a toy.</font>

511
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,589
<font color="yellow">If you step on a toy
and break it by accident</font>

512
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:27,919
<font color="yellow">you will apologize
to the owner of the toy.</font>

513
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:32,000
<font color="yellow">But you don't feel sorry for the toy.</font>

514
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,770
<font color="yellow">Until now, we didn't give
animals proper rights.</font>

515
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,730
<font color="yellow">We considered animals
the same as toys, rocks, and plants...</font>

516
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,430
<font color="yellow">Lift it a bit higher.</font>

517
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,527
<font color="yellow">Higher.</font>

518
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,660
<font color="yellow">Tie it a bit tighter.</font>

519
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,359
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

520
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:57,109
<font color="yellow">Shall I pull it tighter?</font>

521
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:02,520
<font color="yellow">- You tied it?
- I did.</font>

522
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,569
<font color="yellow">Pull it now.</font>

523
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,719
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. What do you
think you're doing here?</font>

524
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:12,290
<font color="yellow">You can't be doing this, seriously.</font>

525
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,759
<font color="yellow">Did you get permission
from the police station?</font>

526
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,390
<font color="yellow">Are we supposed to get permission?</font>

527
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,330
<font color="yellow">- No.
- This is just too much.</font>

528
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,029
<font color="yellow">What's all this, huh?</font>

529
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,609
<font color="yellow">Are there too many?</font>

530
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:34,129
<font color="yellow"><i>Can you please try to investigate?</i></font>

531
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:37,089
<font color="yellow">How can I just take
your word and investigate?</font>

532
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:39,160
<font color="yellow">You will find something
only if you investigate.</font>

533
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,939
<font color="yellow">Joo Hye Sung, a veterinary professor
at Myungsung university.</font>

534
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:44,500
<font color="yellow">- You will find something.
- Please leave.</font>

535
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,750
<font color="yellow">Conduct an investigation.
You will find something. Please!</font>

536
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,009
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

537
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,250
<font color="yellow">You're the detective
who released Bong Pal last time.</font>

538
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,299
<font color="yellow">- How are you?
- Hi.</font>

539
00:43:58,299 --> 00:44:00,379
<font color="yellow">We've met before.</font>

540
00:44:00,379 --> 00:44:02,620
<font color="yellow">By the way, what is it?</font>

541
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:05,719
<font color="yellow"><i>[Joo Hye Sung, veterinary
professor at Myungsung University]</i></font>

542
00:44:06,649 --> 00:44:10,080
<font color="yellow">How do you know Professor Joo?</font>

543
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,589
<font color="yellow">Do you also know him?</font>

544
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,930
<font color="yellow">Are you saying Professor Joo
has Kim Hyun Ji's belongings?</font>

545
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,469
<font color="yellow">I'm saying he does.</font>

546
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:19,120
<font color="yellow">That's why he's the one.</font>

547
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,689
<font color="yellow">At the scene of the accident,
her belongings weren't found.</font>

548
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:25,810
<font color="yellow">It was because he took them all.</font>

549
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,680
<font color="yellow">Even so, we can't start the investigation
without any evidence.</font>

550
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,359
<font color="yellow">Go home. We will contact you.</font>

551
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:34,089
<font color="yellow">It's better to start
the investigation soon.</font>

552
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,379
<font color="yellow">Hello, detectives.</font>

553
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:39,819
<font color="yellow">What's with them?</font>

554
00:44:39,819 --> 00:44:42,620
<font color="yellow">We got a call about them
hanging banners illegally.</font>

555
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,489
<font color="yellow">The vendors caught these students.</font>

556
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:48,149
<font color="yellow">They said they knew you,
so I brought them here.</font>

557
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:50,080
<font color="yellow">Good work. You can go.</font>

558
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,069
<font color="yellow">A banner? What is it about?</font>

559
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:57,259
<font color="yellow">A hit-and-run case?</font>

560
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:07,359
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

561
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,140
<font color="yellow">This case is proceeding
in an interesting way.</font>

562
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,870
<font color="yellow">Go get the case file
from the transportation department.</font>

563
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

564
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:26,680
<font color="yellow">- We will get going now then.
- Wait!</font>

565
00:45:36,919 --> 00:45:40,950
<font color="yellow">- Anything you want to tell us?
- You are going to Myungsung, aren't you?</font>

566
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,939
<font color="yellow">- You rude punks!
- Why are you doing this?</font>

567
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:51,910
<font color="yellow">- Do you know Professor Joo Hye Sung?
- Professor Joo Hye Sung?</font>

568
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,060
<font color="yellow">Ah, he's a veterinary professor
at our school.</font>

569
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,899
<font color="yellow">Then can I ask you to do me a favor?</font>

570
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:07,669
<font color="yellow">We'll wrap up for today. Thank you.</font>

571
00:46:07,669 --> 00:46:10,160
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

572
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:16,290
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji.</font>

573
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:19,370
<font color="yellow">How did you like my class?
Did you like it?</font>

574
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,719
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I liked it.
- Did you?</font>

575
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:23,419
<font color="yellow">A lot of students were dozing off.</font>

576
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:25,239
<font color="yellow">Were they? I thought it was fun.</font>

577
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:27,529
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you liked it.</font>

578
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,839
<font color="yellow">If you have time,
can we go out to eat?</font>

579
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,799
<font color="yellow">We can also schedule
our next appointment.</font>

580
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:35,589
<font color="yellow">Can we do that next time?
I just have things to do today.</font>

581
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:38,370
<font color="yellow">Do you? That's too bad.</font>

582
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,210
<font color="yellow">- I will call you then.
- Sure. Thank you.</font>

583
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:45,779
<font color="yellow">Professor Joo.</font>

584
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:51,069
<font color="yellow">Well, I have something
to talk to you about.</font>

585
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,719
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to tell
me something. What is it?</font>

586
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,710
<font color="yellow">It is...
I'm graduating after this semester.</font>

587
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:08,299
<font color="yellow">So I won't have much time to see you.</font>

588
00:47:08,299 --> 00:47:10,279
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

589
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,600
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

592
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,910
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

593
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,660
<font color="yellow">I wonder if I led you on.</font>

594
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:37,189
<font color="yellow">If I acted inappropriately, I apologize.</font>

595
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,009
<font color="yellow">No, I'm the one who started to like you.</font>

596
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,950
<font color="yellow">I will just appreciate how you feel.</font>

597
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,629
<font color="yellow">Then.</font>

598
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:53,009
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

599
00:48:10,899 --> 00:48:14,439
<font color="yellow">Hey, why did you leave
without talking to me?</font>

600
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:18,310
<font color="yellow">You were talking to Professor Joo.</font>

601
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:27,239
<font color="yellow">- Are you mad at me?
- No.</font>

602
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:29,290
<font color="yellow">- No?
- No.</font>

603
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:46,140
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.
- Yes?</font>

604
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,339
<font color="yellow">Have I been here before?</font>

605
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,669
<font color="yellow">I told you that you followed me around.</font>

606
00:48:52,669 --> 00:48:56,310
<font color="yellow">I still can't believe that,
but this place is familiar.</font>

607
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,419
<font color="yellow">Ah, I need to go now.</font>

608
00:49:31,419 --> 00:49:33,819
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- To see my friends.</font>

609
00:49:34,379 --> 00:49:36,779
<font color="yellow">- Your friends?
- Yes.</font>

610
00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:39,810
<font color="yellow">Some of my high school friends
live in Seoul.</font>

611
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,770
<font color="yellow">They will help me take the GED.</font>

612
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,939
<font color="yellow">- Will they?
- Yes.</font>

613
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,830
<font color="yellow">I will get really busy then.</font>

614
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,649
<font color="yellow">After taking the GED, I will need to
take the SAT and get a job.</font>

615
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,660
<font color="yellow">Take it easy. Why rush?</font>

616
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,600
<font color="yellow">I'm five years behind
compared to everyone else.</font>

617
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
<font color="yellow">I will have to try five times harder.</font>

618
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,730
<font color="yellow">I want to get my life back together.</font>

619
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,149
<font color="yellow">I lost so much all those years.</font>

620
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:08,250
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of things I want to try.</font>

621
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,230
<font color="yellow">Hi, Min Ji. Are you here already?</font>

622
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,299
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will be right there.</font>

623
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,149
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal, I will go.
- Have fun.</font>

624
00:50:25,149 --> 00:50:27,689

626

631
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:36,790
<font color="yellow">Hi, Bong Pal.</font>

632
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:53,759
<font color="yellow">- Did something happen?
- No, no reason.</font>

633
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,230
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking. You've had enough.</font>

634
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,560
<font color="yellow">- I'm okay.
- Stop drinking.</font>

635
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,200
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

636
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:14,700
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I will go to the bathroom.</font>

637
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,210
<font color="yellow">See you next time. Bye.</font>

638
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,810
<font color="yellow">- Where are you?
- <i>Hello?</i></font>

639
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,120
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

640
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:16,207
<font color="yellow"><i>This is Bong Pal's cell phone.</i></font>

641
00:53:19,649 --> 00:53:24,219
<font color="yellow">Senior, get up. I will take you home.</font>

642
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:29,390
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Ji.
- Hello.</font>

643
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,700
<font color="yellow">Hello. There is a cab outside
that brought me here.</font>

644
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,700
<font color="yellow">Take it home.</font>

645
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,899
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Bong Pal.</font>

646
00:53:45,169 --> 00:53:47,219
<font color="yellow">- What's with you?
- What do you mean?</font>

647
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:50,879
<font color="yellow">You said you liked me
and that you were my boyfriend.</font>

648
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,960
<font color="yellow">Then why do you keep changing your mind?</font>

649
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,410
<font color="yellow">It bothers me.</font>

650
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,370
<font color="yellow">- It bothers you?
- Of course it bothers me.</font>

651
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,770
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes, it just bothers me.</font>

652
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,029
<font color="yellow">You being with another girl bothers me.</font>

653
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:05,500
<font color="yellow">You're smiling? How can you smile now?</font>

654
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,529
<font color="yellow">When a man loves a woman,
he should stick to his feelings.</font>

655
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:11,330
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do this.</font>

656
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,239
<font color="yellow">Even if I don't remember you</font>

657
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:15,669
<font color="yellow">you should find a way to try anything...</font>

658
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:24,710
<font color="yellow">You pervert!</font>

659
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,669
<font color="yellow">Don't ever call me again!</font>

660
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:37,299
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

661
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,399
<font color="yellow">You should at least apply
the ointment before you leave...</font>

662
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:52,219
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you asked
me to apply the ointment.</font>

663
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:55,089
<font color="yellow">Ouch! It hurts.</font>

664
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:59,120
<font color="yellow">What do you mean it hurts?
I'm applying it so gently.</font>

665
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:16,259
<font color="yellow">- All done.
- Ouch!</font>

666
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:18,870
<font color="yellow">- You're grateful, right?
- I'm grateful.</font>

667
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,000
<font color="yellow">It's late, but I wanted to congratulate
you on coming home from the hospital.</font>

668
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,870
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

669
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:39,779
<font color="yellow">It's a necklace.</font>

670
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,060
<font color="yellow">I will put it on you.</font>

671
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,330
<font color="yellow">Then are we now going out?</font>

672
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:22,279
<font color="yellow">Well, it depends on how you behave...</font>

673
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,399
<font color="yellow">I will behave.</font>

674
00:56:25,399 --> 00:56:27,609
<font color="yellow">See what happens
if you're seen with another girl.</font>

675
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:29,759
<font color="yellow">It won't happen again.</font>

676
00:56:30,439 --> 00:56:32,529
<font color="yellow">You're the only one for me.</font>

677
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:37,430
<font color="yellow">Get home safe.</font>

678
00:56:38,593 --> 00:56:39,850
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

679
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:41,850
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

680
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:44,169
<font color="yellow">You have a good night too.</font>

681
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,430
<font color="yellow">- What took you so long?
- I told you I'd see friends today.</font>

682
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,989
<font color="yellow">- Can you stay home alone for a little?
- Sure.</font>

683
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:38,339
<font color="yellow">I'm not a little kid. Why ask?</font>

684
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:41,330
<font color="yellow">I'm going over to your uncle's.</font>

685
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,219
<font color="yellow">- Lock up, okay?
- I will.</font>

686
00:57:45,219 --> 00:57:47,739
<font color="yellow">- Wait, Mom.
- Yes?</font>

687
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:51,140
<font color="yellow">- Pick up ice cream on your way home.
- You got it.</font>

688
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,739
<font color="yellow">- See you later.
- See you later.</font>

689
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:24,710
<font color="yellow">Sir, what are you looking at?</font>

690
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,330
<font color="yellow">I'm looking at the record
of the cars Joo has had.</font>

691
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:31,430
<font color="yellow">It was a white car that was seen
at the hit-and-run scene, right?</font>

692
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, it was a white sedan.</font>

693
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,419
