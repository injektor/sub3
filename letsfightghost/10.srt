1
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:28,694
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

2
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:33,048
<font color="yellow">I don't care what others think about us.</font>

3
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,846
<font color="yellow">I like you just the way you are, Hyun Ji.</font>

4
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,001
<font color="yellow"><i>[Episode 10]</i></font>

5
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,063
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

6
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,180
<font color="yellow">Are you Professor Joo Hye Sung?</font>

7
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,627
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

8
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,354
<font color="yellow">Do you know Bong Pal?
Park Bong Pal.</font>

9
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:39,840
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Ah.</font>

10
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:43,346
<font color="yellow">I'm like an uncle to him.</font>

11
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:48,060
<font color="yellow">I heard his professor worked here,
so I decided to stop by and say hello.</font>

12
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:51,221
<font color="yellow">Is that right? It's nice to meet you.</font>

13
00:01:54,413 --> 00:02:00,056
<font color="yellow">You seem very familiar.
Have we ever met before?</font>

14
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:06,621
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it, I think we saw
each other around the neighborhood.</font>

15
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:08,217
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

16
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,340
<font color="yellow">It was a very long time ago.</font>

17
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,744
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

18
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:28,173
<font color="yellow">- I don't remember.
- I see.</font>

19
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:34,811
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

20
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,474
<font color="yellow">- We got lunch.
- Go ahead and eat first.</font>

21
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:45,180
<font color="yellow">I see it's lunchtime. Forgive me
for taking so much of your time.</font>

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,942
<font color="yellow">- Not at all.
- Please enjoy your lunch.</font>

23
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,691
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of my Bong Pal.</font>

24
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,128
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

25
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,720
<font color="yellow">Excuse me then.</font>

26
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:15,633
<font color="yellow">Ah, Monk.</font>

27
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,131
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you next time.
- Yes.</font>

28
00:03:48,163 --> 00:03:52,059
<font color="yellow">- This looks so good.
- Eat slowly.</font>

29
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:03,800
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about anything.</font>

30
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,091
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

31
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,488
<font color="yellow">Monk Myung Chul.</font>

32
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,245
<font color="yellow">I guess he's not here.</font>

33
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:29,451
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

34
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:40,187
<font color="yellow">What did he watch again?</font>

35
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:44,206
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, is this you?
You are so cute! When was it?</font>

36
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,141
<font color="yellow">This was my middle school graduation.</font>

37
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:50,351
<font color="yellow">Why was Monk Myun Chul
watching this all of a sudden?</font>

38
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:52,927
<font color="yellow">He kept mentioning
my graduation earlier.</font>

39
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:03,148
<font color="yellow">- Come on, let's watch a little more.
- There's nothing to watch. Forget it.</font>

40
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:05,422
<font color="yellow">I'm curious about your childhood.</font>

41
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:07,120
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Just watch it next time.</font>

42
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,892
<font color="yellow">When next time?</font>

43
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:12,153
<font color="yellow">Just next time.</font>

44
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:14,023
<font color="yellow">Who recorded this?</font>

45
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:16,226
<font color="yellow">Oh, my father.</font>

46
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:18,500
<font color="yellow">He used to work as
a producer a long time ago.</font>

47
00:05:18,502 --> 00:05:20,925
<font color="yellow">So it must have been a copy of his.</font>

48
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:25,262
<font color="yellow">Did your father record all
those videos in that room too?</font>

49
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:27,536
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

50
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,033
<font color="yellow">- What did he film?
- I don't know. Random stuff.</font>

51
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,642
<font color="yellow">I've never watched them.</font>

52
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,245
<font color="yellow">I was wondering...</font>

53
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,935
<font color="yellow">Why do you live
seperately from your dad?</font>

54
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:54,978
<font color="yellow">It just... happened to be that way.
I'm going to wash up.</font>

55
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,757
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

56
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:49,401
<font color="yellow">There's something
suspicious about that punk.</font>

57
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:56,514
<font color="yellow">- Is it good?
- It's totally good. Sit down.</font>

58
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:03,151
<font color="yellow"><i>- Should we go inside?
- No, it's not cold at all.</i></font>

59
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:33,146
<font color="yellow">Goodness, goodness.</font>

60
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:37,156
<font color="yellow">Let's turn it off.</font>

61
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,057
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to bed.
- Oh, yeah.</font>

62
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:43,281
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

63
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,749
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

64
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,418
<font color="yellow">Why isn't it turning on?
Why isn't it turning on?</font>

65
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:40,691
<font color="yellow">Why aren't the lights turning on?
There we go.</font>

66
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:54,250
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

67
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,167
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

68
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:00,708
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.
One, two, three.</font>

69
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,785
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.
One, two, three.</font>

70
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:16,602
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.
One, two, three.</font>

71
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:18,772
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.
One, two, three.</font>

72
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,245
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

73
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:31,432
<font color="yellow">Where is the manager?</font>

74
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:35,143
<font color="yellow">What brings you here instead of him?</font>

75
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:38,537
<font color="yellow">I saw something.</font>

76
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:44,121
<font color="yellow">- I think it was a ghost.
- A ghost, you say?</font>

77
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:48,317
<font color="yellow">Ghost. Ghost... G...
G... a ghost, you say?</font>

78
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:53,570
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.
You've got bags under your eyes.</font>

79
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:56,467
<font color="yellow">Okay, give me your right hand.
It's okay, it's okay.</font>

80
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:00,654
<font color="yellow">His pulse is so weak.</font>

81
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:06,057
<font color="yellow">You're able to see ghosts because
there's darkness surrounding you!</font>

82
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:12,032
<font color="yellow">We can shine light upon you.</font>

83
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,480
<font color="yellow">Then what do I have to do?</font>

84
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,240
<font color="yellow">We will take care of everything.</font>

85
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,171
<font color="yellow">You, sir...</font>

86
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:23,684
<font color="yellow">You just have to prepare the cash.</font>

87
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,572
<font color="yellow">Up front. Yes, over there.</font>

88
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,149
<font color="yellow">The right side, the right side.</font>

89
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:49,376
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, this ghost has been
seen all over the school.</font>

90
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:53,740
<font color="yellow">But the way it looks is very peculiar.</font>

91
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:19,212
<font color="yellow">Is this the right place?</font>

92
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:41,932
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, do you see something?</font>

93
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,923
<font color="yellow">No, it's not here.
I think it left this place.</font>

94
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,990
<font color="yellow">- No.
- What about you? Do you see it?</font>

95
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,687
<font color="yellow">There's no ghostly energy.</font>

96
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:55,578
<font color="yellow">Ah.</font>

97
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:01,009
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

98
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,447
<font color="yellow">- Ah, that scared me!
- It's here! It's here!</font>

99
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:06,946
<font color="yellow">It's here! Wait for me!</font>

100
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:39,081
<font color="yellow">- Something is strange.
- Yeah.</font>

101
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,760
<font color="yellow">What the heck!</font>

102
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,886
<font color="yellow">- Get it! Get it!
- Bong Pal, we caught the ghost!</font>

103
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,311
<font color="yellow">We caught the ghost!</font>

104
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:01,537
<font color="yellow">- I'm not afraid of ghosts!
- I'm not a ghost, I'm a person!</font>

105
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:04,503
<font color="yellow">- No, you're not!
- Hold on! Hold on!</font>

106
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,671
<font color="yellow">Senior Hyun Kyu?
It's you, isn't it?</font>

107
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,575
<font color="yellow">Senior?</font>

108
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:13,601
<font color="yellow">Let go! Let go!</font>

109
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,927
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

110
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:24,389
<font color="yellow">What... what is this?</font>

111
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:31,940
<font color="yellow">Geranium helps with breathing
and strengthens your immunity.</font>

112
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:35,737
<font color="yellow">This bracelet is made from geranium.
You can't take it, okay?</font>

113
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:38,610
<font color="yellow">I've counted all of them.</font>

114
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,894
<font color="yellow">Senior, what happened to you?</font>

115
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:49,091
<font color="yellow">Life is tough.</font>

116
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:56,413
<font color="yellow">Senior, that guy earlier.</font>

117
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:59,241
<font color="yellow">He must've been hiding
in the school for a very long time.</font>

118
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:01,469
<font color="yellow">Yes, it seems that way.</font>

119
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,485
<font color="yellow">Getting hired must really be hard.</font>

120
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:09,472
<font color="yellow">I heard he was a genius
when he was attending school.</font>

121
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,567
<font color="yellow">What the heck is a geranium pyramid?</font>

122
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:16,378
<font color="yellow">He's being chased by
debt collectors because of it.</font>

123
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:26,177
<font color="yellow">What is this?
Why are you carrying this?</font>

124
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:31,859
<font color="yellow">This is not... this is not
the exorcism fee, is it?</font>

125
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:39,346
<font color="yellow">You catch on real quick!</font>

126
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:42,956
<font color="yellow">You know, I was listening
to that senior's story</font>

127
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:47,793
<font color="yellow">and this bath mat is
made from natural geranium.</font>

128
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:54,506
<font color="yellow">It helps with breathing, builds
immunity, and... produces endorphins.</font>

129
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:58,246
<font color="yellow">I can't stop laughing ever
since I put this bracelet on.</font>

130
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,984
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, this geranium
bracelet is for you.</font>

131
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,551
<font color="yellow">Here, try it on.</font>

132
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,875
<font color="yellow">You keep the healthy stuff.</font>

133
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,650
<font color="yellow">I want money.
I have to go to class. See you.</font>

134
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,023
<font color="yellow">Why did you accept this?</font>

135
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,355
<font color="yellow">He has no money!
What was I supposed to do?</font>

136
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:27,078
<font color="yellow">Ah, how about we give
this to your grandma?</font>

137
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,462
<font color="yellow">My grand...</font>

138
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,852
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

139
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:40,769
<font color="yellow">Yeah, what is this?
Are these mosquito bites?</font>

140
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,326
<font color="yellow">Hold on...</font>

141
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,508
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to look at.</font>

142
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:04,362
<font color="yellow">The alcohol level has
been confirmed from her blood.</font>

143
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,775
<font color="yellow">She cracked her skull and broke
her collarbone and femur from the fall.</font>

144
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:11,518
<font color="yellow">There's visible injury
to her head. That's all.</font>

145
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,862
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

146
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:18,453
<font color="yellow">She killed the person she loved
and killed herself because of the guilt.</font>

147
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:22,076
<font color="yellow">- It's like a novel.
- Let's not go that far.</font>

148
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:25,337
<font color="yellow">It's just a suicide.</font>

149
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:30,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

150
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:31,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

151
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:35,679
<font color="yellow">This case is not your concern.
Why are you interested in it?</font>

152
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,951
<font color="yellow">Someone is making me interested.</font>

153
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:40,951
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

154
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:43,967
<font color="yellow">That professor?</font>

155
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:46,133
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Senior.</font>

156
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,799
<font color="yellow">The chief wants us to hurry up
and take care of the Wooyongdong case.</font>

157
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,750
<font color="yellow">Get going. You must be busy.</font>

158
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,099
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

159
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,053
<font color="yellow">Are you going to head
straight up to Seoul?</font>

160
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,836
<font color="yellow">You have the address of Professor
Joo Hye Sung's mother, right?</font>

161
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,420
<font color="yellow">Yes, but why do you ask?</font>

162
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,873
<font color="yellow">You're not thinking of
going there now, are you?</font>

163
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,035
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

164
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:13,202
<font color="yellow">The chief is going to
throw a fit if he finds out.</font>

165
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:15,516
<font color="yellow">I'll go by myself then.</font>

166
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:25,441
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

167
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:35,542
<font color="yellow"><i>No!</i></font>

168
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,088
<font color="yellow">Dad, where are you?</font>

169
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:41,382
<font color="yellow">He's at it again!
When are you coming?</font>

170
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:44,059
<font color="yellow">Come quickly! Mom's not home either!</font>

171
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,338
<font color="yellow">Dad, come quickly!</font>

172
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,644
<font color="yellow">Brother!</font>

173
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:56,000
<font color="yellow">Brother. Brother.</font>

174
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,432
<font color="yellow">You're injured! Oh no!</font>

175
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:01,384
<font color="yellow">Brother! Brother, wake up!</font>

176
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:03,728
<font color="yellow">- Brother!
- Move... Move!</font>

177
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,282
<font color="yellow">Brother, what's the matter with you?</font>

178
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,380
<font color="yellow">Don't do this. You're scaring me.</font>

179
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,586
<font color="yellow">Brother.</font>

180
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:28,586
<font color="yellow">Brother!</font>

181
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:59,807
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Don't!</font>

182
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:03,411
<font color="yellow">"Hyun Ji, I don't know when
we'll ever meet again..."</font>

183
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:07,215
<font color="yellow">Now you're writing love letters?</font>

184
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:10,580
<font color="yellow">It's going to get wrinkled.
It's going to get wrinkled!</font>

185
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:15,616
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Did you just hit me?</font>

186
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,556
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have
taken it away from me.</font>

187
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,864
<font color="yellow">Did you just hit me because of a ghost?</font>

188
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:24,365
<font color="yellow">It wasn't intentional.
Let me see, let me see. Are you okay?</font>

189
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:25,805
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

190
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:27,537
<font color="yellow">My eye.</font>

191
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:31,494
<font color="yellow">- I can't see.
- You can't see?</font>

192
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:35,025
<font color="yellow">I can't see.
I can't see.</font>

<font color="yellow">I can't.... Shim Chung!
Shim Chung! Shim Chung, where are...</font>

194
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:42,868
<font color="yellow">- You can see.
- You're right.</font>

195
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,063
<font color="yellow">You... You... I'm going to
put you in a mental institute.</font>

196
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,590
<font color="yellow">Do it.</font>

197
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Blood Sausage Soup,
your 24-hour exorcism service.</font>

198
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,557
<font color="yellow">I'm Choi Chun Sang, how may I help you?</font>

199
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,702
<font color="yellow"><i>[Notice]</i></font>

- Perfect! Should we go somewhere?</font>

<font color="yellow">All you want to do is have fun.</font>

203
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:30,246
<font color="yellow">At least I study hard.</font>

Professor Joo Hye Sung's mother?</font>

206
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,761
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you.</font>

207
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,920
<font color="yellow">What brings you here from Seoul?</font>

208
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:10,378
<font color="yellow">I apologize for the sudden visit.</font>

209
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,987
<font color="yellow">We came here to ask you a question.</font>

210
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,588
<font color="yellow">- Is it about Hye Sung?
- Yes.</font>

211
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:19,954
<font color="yellow">Has your son come to visit you recently?</font>

212
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:25,386
<font color="yellow">He does visit often.</font>

213
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,621
<font color="yellow">Do you remember when that was?</font>

214
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,622
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me?
- The day your son came to visit you.</font>

215
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,904
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you remember?</font>

216
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,377
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

217
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:43,078
<font color="yellow">I don't remember the exact day.</font>

218
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,471
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter?
- Senior.</font>

219
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,366
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Over there.</font>

220
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:02,871
<font color="yellow">You drove quite a distance.
So, did you confirm everything?</font>

221
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:06,066
<font color="yellow">I don't know. You should
ask your mother directly.</font>

222
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:09,439
<font color="yellow">Sorry to bother you.
Goodbye, ma'am.</font>

223
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,424
<font color="yellow">He hasn't returned.
My mom is looking for him</font>

224
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,679
<font color="yellow">but it's been over an hour already.</font>

225

<font color="yellow">- You saw a ghost?
- Yes.</font>

227
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:49,753
<font color="yellow">Do you think she'll hurt Hyun Bin?</font>

228
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:53,069
<font color="yellow">Is there a place he usually goes to?</font>

229
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:56,428
<font color="yellow">My parents probably already went there.</font>

230
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,231
<font color="yellow">What about a place
Soo Kyung would go to?</font>

231
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:03,932
<font color="yellow">Over there.</font>

232
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:08,900
<font color="yellow">He probably went here.</font>

233
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:11,494
<font color="yellow">He scattered her ashes here.</font>

234
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,471
<font color="yellow">Over there!</font>

235
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,292

236
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:47,998
<font color="yellow">- Senior, drive faster.
- I'm going as fast as I can.</font>

237
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,292
<font color="yellow">Step on it! Step on it more!</font>

238
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:04,134
<font color="yellow"><i>Step on it!</i></font>

239
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:07,469
<font color="yellow">We're almost there.</font>

240
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,990

- What's wrong with this thing?</font>

241
00:24:11,587 --> 00:24:13,284
<font color="yellow">There's smoke!</font>

242
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,789
<font color="yellow">I hope it doesn't explode!</font>

243
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:28,603
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go first.</font>

244
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:40,894
<font color="yellow">Who are you?
What are you doing?</font>

245
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:44,564
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Why are you trying
to kill him when you should save him?</font>

246
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:46,903
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Why would I kill Hyun Bin?</font>

247
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,593
<font color="yellow">- I'm trying to save him right now!
- Soo Kyung.</font>

248
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:52,894
<font color="yellow">I'll see you soon.</font>

249
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:58,015
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

250
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:54,198
<font color="yellow">Hyun Bin, please don't do this.</font>

251
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:04,902
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung.</font>

252
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,871
<font color="yellow">It's brain cancer.</font>

253
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:15,221
<font color="yellow">At most, you have
three months to live.</font>

254
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:21,846
<font color="yellow">What about surgery?</font>

255
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:25,999
<font color="yellow">Surgery is possible,
but it's not guaranteed.</font>

256
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,740
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

257
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,055
<font color="yellow">That's dangerous.</font>

258
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,175
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

259
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,755
<font color="yellow">Ow, that hurts.</font>

260
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:06,609
<font color="yellow">Are you determined to kill yourself?</font>

261
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:12,251
<font color="yellow">- It not like it's the end of the world!
- It is the end of the world for me.</font>

262
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,154
<font color="yellow">Ah, I see. I didn't know.</font>

263
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:20,451
<font color="yellow">Did you think I was going to say that?</font>

264
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:24,357
<font color="yellow">Look, I don't know what your story is</font>

265
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:28,055
<font color="yellow">but why are you giving up
already? You're too young.</font>

266
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:33,732
<font color="yellow">No one knows the future. You have
to live each day to its fullest.</font>

267
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:35,921
<font color="yellow">Carpe diem. Don't you
know what that means?</font>

268
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:39,473
<font color="yellow">Something good might happen.</font>

269
00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:44,123
<font color="yellow">So be strong, okay?</font>

270
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:48,143
<font color="yellow">- Be strong.
- You can do it! Fighting!</font>

271
00:27:50,684 --> 00:27:53,277
<font color="yellow">I can do it! Fighting!</font>

272
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:56,414
<font color="yellow">Go home safely.</font>

273
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:59,944
<font color="yellow">People follow traffic signals, got it?</font>

274
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:04,880
<font color="yellow">Oh, I have to go now!</font>

275
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:26,012
<font color="yellow">- I'd like to buy these, please.
- Yes, sir!</font>

276
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:41,729
<font color="yellow">You made the right decision.
Coffee is much better than alcohol.</font>

277
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:48,186
<font color="yellow">Here you go. Goodbye... wait! Here!</font>

278
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:53,031
<font color="yellow">- Take this.
- You can drink that.</font>

279
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:02,061
<font color="yellow">Oh, and...</font>

280
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:19,330
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>

281
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,817
<font color="yellow">- You're here.
- Did you wait too long?</font>

282
00:29:22,817 --> 00:29:25,667
<font color="yellow">No... well, I waited
for a really long time.</font>

283
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,124
<font color="yellow">- Be careful.
- I will.</font>

284
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:37,124
<font color="yellow">Be careful!</font>

285
00:29:56,719 --> 00:30:00,746
<font color="yellow">I need to go somewhere for several days.
I'll be right back.</font>

286
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:02,936
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

287
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:06,009
<font color="yellow">- Don't take too long.
- When I return...</font>

288
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,396
<font color="yellow">I'll come straight to you.</font>

289
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:15,993
<font color="yellow">Okay, have a safe trip.</font>

290
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:24,722
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

291
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:32,556
<font color="yellow">The surgery will go well, right?</font>

292
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:34,695
<font color="yellow">I will do my best.</font>

293
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:36,382
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

294
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,759
<font color="yellow">I want to live.</font>

295
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,205
<font color="yellow">- Have a good night.
- Thank you.</font>

296
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:09,638
<font color="yellow">Oh my, Hyun Bin called me.</font>

297
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:19,443
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry.</i></font>

298
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:26,040
<font color="yellow"><i>I might not be able to return to you.</i></font>

299
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,157
<font color="yellow"><i>That's why I wanted
to tell you the truth.</i></font>

300
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:35,224
<font color="yellow"><i>The truth is, I...</i></font>

301
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,833
<font color="yellow"><i>Soo Kyung, I miss you.</i></font>

302
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:59,989
<font color="yellow">Hyun Bin, are you okay?
Can you think clearly?</font>

303
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,116
<font color="yellow">I'll go get Mom and Dad.</font>

304
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:25,452
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Can you hear me?</font>

305
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,301
<font color="yellow">Can you answer the phone, please?</font>

306
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,971
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

307
00:32:33,021 --> 00:32:34,981
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

308
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:38,981
<font color="yellow">No... No!</font>

309
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:44,054
<font color="yellow">No! No!</font>

310
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:46,952
<font color="yellow"><i>[Shin Soo Kyung]</i></font>

311
00:32:46,952 --> 00:32:50,031
<font color="yellow"><i>Shin Soo Kyung... Soo Kyung.</i></font>

312
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,092
<font color="yellow"><i>No...</i></font>

313
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,652
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Soo Kyung.</font>

314
00:33:18,652 --> 00:33:23,271
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't called you then...</font>

315
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:28,152
<font color="yellow">No, it wasn't your fault.</font>

316
00:33:29,202 --> 00:33:31,392
<font color="yellow">So please don't try to die.</font>

317
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,162
<font color="yellow">I tried that so I could come see you.</font>

318
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:37,471
<font color="yellow">Why did I have the surgery done?</font>

319
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:40,301
<font color="yellow">So I could be with you
and live with you.</font>

320
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:43,591
<font color="yellow">If you die and get to be with me...</font>

321
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:48,082
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't like that.</font>

322
00:33:48,312 --> 00:33:50,602
<font color="yellow">It would make me more sad.</font>

323
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:53,582
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung, please...</font>

324
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:09,042
<font color="yellow">I was very happy that I was with you.</font>

325
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:12,591
<font color="yellow">Now I will leave with our happy memories.</font>

326
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:14,932
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you.</font>

327
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:19,011
<font color="yellow">- Soo Kyung.
- Hyun Bin.</font>

328
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:25,901
<font color="yellow">Please promise me that
you won't hurt yourself again.</font>

329
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,662
<font color="yellow">You promised me, right?</font>

330
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:48,191
<font color="yellow">- I love you.
- I love you too.</font>

331
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:54,232
<font color="yellow">I will always love you.</font>

332
00:35:11,002 --> 00:35:12,932
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung...</font>

333
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:30,781
<font color="yellow">He'll be all right, right?</font>

334
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:33,971
<font color="yellow">He will be okay.</font>

335
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:54,721
<font color="yellow">Senior, I will
return the clothes tomorrow.</font>

336
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:57,602
<font color="yellow">Sure. You did well today.</font>

337
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:02,202
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, wait a minute.</font>

338
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:09,522
<font color="yellow">Well... can you give this
to Hyun Ji for me?</font>

339
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:11,571
<font color="yellow">Tell her it is from my heart.</font>

340
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,872
<font color="yellow">- In Rang.
- Yes?</font>

341
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:21,952
<font color="yellow">- About Hyun Ji...
- Yes?</font>

342
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:23,801
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji...</font>

343
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:28,071
<font color="yellow">- In Rang.
- Yes?</font>

344
00:36:28,071 --> 00:36:30,071
<font color="yellow">- About Hyun Ji...
- Yes?</font>

345
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:35,212
<font color="yellow">She already likes someone.</font>

346
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:38,183
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

347
00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:43,941
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

348
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:56,171
<font color="yellow">It hurts...</font>

349
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:06,852
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

350
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:16,671
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

351
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:23,171
<font color="yellow">We will also have to separate
like them some day.</font>

352
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:26,058
<font color="yellow">Probably.</font>

353
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:29,642
<font color="yellow">So what? What matters
is that I'm happy now.</font>

354
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,732
<font color="yellow">Worrying about the future
won't change anything.</font>

355
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:39,372
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're the one
who told me not to worry.</font>

356
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,991
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

357
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:50,522
<font color="yellow">By the way, In Rang will be okay, right?</font>

358
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:55,272
<font color="yellow">He will be okay.</font>

359
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:03,602
<font color="yellow">This is why you should've listened to me.</font>

360
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:05,881
<font color="yellow">How can you be in love with a ghost?</font>

361
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,702
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

362
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:13,002
<font color="yellow">,If I had known it would hurt this much
I wouldn't have started.</font>

363
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:36,971
<font color="yellow">I wrote this letter for her personally.</font>

364
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,301
<font color="yellow">Such a fool.</font>

365
00:38:54,738 --> 00:38:57,412
<font color="yellow">I will let you go, Kim Hyun Ji!</font>

366
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:09,792
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can go on, either.</font>

367
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:12,412
<font color="yellow">I will go see her. I will.</font>

368
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:15,341
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Ji, I will come see you!
- Hey!</font>

369
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:19,381
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me!
- No!</font>

370
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:30,702
<font color="yellow">If you die,
how am I supposed to live?</font>

371
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,452
<font color="yellow">I want to see Hyun Ji.</font>

372
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:36,821
<font color="yellow">I want to see Hyun Ji,
Chun Sang. I really do.</font>

373
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:42,261
<font color="yellow">It really hurts.
It really does, Chun Sang.</font>

374
00:39:42,261 --> 00:39:43,471
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

375
00:39:43,471 --> 00:39:45,471
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you sure it was the same man?</i></font>

376
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:51,002
<font color="yellow">I'm not so sure,
but I have this bad feeling.</font>

377
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:53,752
<font color="yellow">When I shook his hand,
my whole body was in pain.</font>

378
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:56,292
<font color="yellow">If you felt such a thing
when you're such a lousy monk</font>

379
00:39:56,292 --> 00:39:58,812
<font color="yellow">he must be extraordinary.</font>

380
00:40:01,122 --> 00:40:02,921
<font color="yellow">By the way,
what brings you here today?</font>

381
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:05,232
<font color="yellow">Perhaps you want me to...</font>

382
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:07,801
<font color="yellow">No way! I can't handle such a man.</font>

383
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:09,542
<font color="yellow">It's not my specialty either.</font>

384
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:12,212
<font color="yellow">I've seen In Hyok go down like that.</font>

385
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:14,941
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about it.</font>

386
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:16,455
<font color="yellow">You're being a chicken.</font>

387
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:19,662
<font color="yellow">- That's not why I came.
- Then what is it?</font>

388
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:24,901
<font color="yellow">You know the weapon that I used
on Bong Pal when he was little.</font>

389
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:27,011
<font color="yellow">Can I get the same weapon again?</font>

390
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:30,562
<font color="yellow">- Didn't it break?
- That's what I'm saying.</font>

391
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:37,801
<font color="yellow">It's so rare that
it will be hard to find now.</font>

392
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:39,732
<font color="yellow">It will make me feel better if I have it.</font>

393
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:41,120
<font color="yellow">Can you ask around to see?</font>

394
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:43,091
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

395
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:46,712
<font color="yellow">And can you make me an talisman?</font>

396
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:49,182
<font color="yellow">I will have Bong Pal carry it.</font>

397
00:40:49,182 --> 00:40:51,412
<font color="yellow">But I don't know if it will work.</font>

398
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:29,531
<font color="yellow">I will go back now.</font>

399
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:33,102
<font color="yellow">Do that. It's getting late.</font>

400
00:41:33,102 --> 00:41:35,341
<font color="yellow">Drive safely.</font>

401
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:43,051
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt?</font>

402
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:46,462
<font color="yellow">It's not serious.</font>

403
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:56,252
<font color="yellow">I will go now.</font>

404
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:07,171
<font color="yellow">Hey, who was that?</font>

405
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:12,948
<font color="yellow">Was it your son?
He's very handsome.</font>

406
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:17,932
<font color="yellow">He's not my son.</font>

407
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:21,011
<font color="yellow">He is...</font>

408
00:42:28,872 --> 00:42:32,832
<font color="yellow">Is anybody here? Someone fell!</font>

409
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,622
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Me? Studying.</font>

410
00:43:29,622 --> 00:43:31,372
<font color="yellow">You're already studying this early?</font>

411
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:34,662
<font color="yellow">I have to study hard. I don't have
much time until the SAT.</font>

412
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:45,881
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going to eat?
- After I finish this.</font>

413
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,171
<font color="yellow">- Why did you do that?
- I want you to take it easy.</font>

414
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:54,051
<font color="yellow">If you work too hard now,
it will be tough on you later on.</font>

415
00:43:56,156 --> 00:43:58,111
<font color="yellow">No, don't look.</font>

416
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:00,694
<font color="yellow">I already saw them.</font>

417
00:44:02,352 --> 00:44:03,892
<font color="yellow">- When?
- A while ago.</font>

418
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:06,332
<font color="yellow">Let me see them. Come on.</font>

419
00:44:09,131 --> 00:44:12,142
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you drew all over
on Seo Yeon's face.</font>

420
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:15,091
<font color="yellow">What? Give them back
if you're going to tease me.</font>

421
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:17,682
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you made her look ugly.</font>

422
00:44:17,682 --> 00:44:21,082
<font color="yellow">- Are you jealous of her?
- No way. What jealousy?</font>

423
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:23,232
<font color="yellow">Then what is this?</font>

424
00:44:23,232 --> 00:44:26,111
<font color="yellow">If you're going to tease me,
give them back.</font>

425
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:29,712
<font color="yellow">I can't even take
a single photo with you.</font>

426
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:31,712
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

427
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,702
<font color="yellow">I don't personally like photos.</font>

428
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,952
<font color="yellow">I prefer seeing things in person.</font>

429
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:53,241
<font color="yellow">It is better to see
you in person like this.</font>

430
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:58,122
<font color="yellow">- You're so ugly.
- What did you say?</font>

431
00:44:58,122 --> 00:45:00,531
<font color="yellow">- Say what?
- Stop it.</font>

432
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,952
<font color="yellow">- I will keep doing it.
- I said stop.</font>

433
00:45:02,952 --> 00:45:04,261
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

434
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,671
<font color="yellow">- Neener!
- Hey!</font>

435
00:45:09,702 --> 00:45:13,352
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, what now?
Hey, it hurts.</i></font>

436
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:15,841
<font color="yellow"><i>- Hey!</i>
- It sounds like Bong Pal...</font>

437
00:45:17,102 --> 00:45:20,002
<font color="yellow">When did he start to laugh like that?</font>

438
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:22,241
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, why? </i></font>

439
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:24,962
<font color="yellow">- He didn't even lock the door.
- <i>I'm really sorry. Hey.</i></font>

440
00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:28,712
<font color="yellow">- It's so low of me to hit me there.
- Okay, I got it.</font>

441
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:33,412
<font color="yellow">I'm late. I have a class at 11:30 a.m.</font>

442
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:36,292
<font color="yellow">- How about breakfast then?
- We will eat at school.</font>

443
00:45:36,852 --> 00:45:38,651
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

444
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:43,352
<font color="yellow">Monk Myung Chul.</font>

445
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:47,801
<font color="yellow">Who were you talking to just now?</font>

446
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:56,022
<font color="yellow">I asked who you were talking to just now.</font>

447
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,542
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

448
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:04,082
<font color="yellow">were you with that female
ghost from last time?</font>

449
00:46:04,082 --> 00:46:07,191
<font color="yellow">- Why are you getting up already?
- I will make more sausage.</font>

450
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:10,202
<font color="yellow">It's not for you.
There is a stray cat around.</font>

451
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,841
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal!</font>

452
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,441
<font color="yellow">Did you get this toothbrush
for me to use?</font>

453
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:20,881
<font color="yellow">You've been living with
that female ghost all this time?</font>

454
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:23,091
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

455
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,662
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry about it.
- What do you think you're doing?</font>

456
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:33,441
<font color="yellow">Are you in some kind of love
with that ghost?</font>

457
00:46:33,801 --> 00:46:36,991
<font color="yellow">- I said don't worry about it.
- Your mom died because of a ghost.</font>

458
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:39,272
<font color="yellow">But you're with a ghost?</font>

459
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:42,252
<font color="yellow">We will fix your eyes immediately.
I will look into it.</font>

460
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:45,542
<font color="yellow">Also, stop going around exorcising!</font>

461
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,881
<font color="yellow">- I will take care of it.
- I don't think so, punk!</font>

462
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:50,812
<font color="yellow">- Let's end it right now!
- I don't want to!</font>

463
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:55,381
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

464
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:01,292
<font color="yellow">do you have feelings for that ghost?</font>

465
00:47:13,852 --> 00:47:15,801
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

466
00:47:17,452 --> 00:47:21,321
<font color="yellow">- So please stay out of it.
- You punk...</font>

467
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:28,542
<font color="yellow">Fine. I will stay out of your business.</font>

468
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:39,562
<font color="yellow">Did your mom die because of a ghost?</font>

469
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:44,111
<font color="yellow">You're trying to save
money to fix your eyes?</font>

470
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:49,272
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry about what he said.
- It's true, isn't it?</font>

471
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:54,462
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know, like a fool.</font>

472
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:57,721
<font color="yellow">I said don't worry about it.</font>

473
00:47:58,372 --> 00:48:00,221
<font color="yellow">Let's go to school.</font>

474
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:04,301
<font color="yellow">I will stay home today.
You go ahead.</font>

475
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:28,392
<font color="yellow">When we have no idea
what's happened to his dad... seriously!</font>

476
00:48:33,332 --> 00:48:37,261
<font color="yellow">Let me see. According to
the lunar calendar, today is...</font>

477
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:42,062
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.
It's Bong Pal's birthday today.</font>

478
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:24,912
<font color="yellow">Why do I care about
this stubborn punk who doesn't listen?</font>

479
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:33,002
<font color="yellow"><i>Bong Pal! Bong Pal!</i></font>

480
00:49:33,002 --> 00:49:36,292
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do?
I can't just leave the cake here.</font>

481
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:39,392
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

482
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:58,812
<font color="yellow">He should've cleaned it
a little bit before he left.</font>

483
00:50:14,562 --> 00:50:16,721
<font color="yellow">I know you're in here.</font>

484
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:21,111
<font color="yellow">Don't leave and hear me out.</font>

485
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:25,381
<font color="yellow">I don't know why you're stuck here.</font>

486
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,573
<font color="yellow">Leave Bong Pal.</font>

487
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,122
<font color="yellow">You don't seem like an evil spirit.</font>

488
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:40,212
<font color="yellow">Please leave Bong Pal for his sake.</font>

489
00:50:42,062 --> 00:50:45,301
<font color="yellow">When he was little</font>

490
00:50:45,301 --> 00:50:48,102
<font color="yellow">an evil spirit entered his body.</font>

491
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:53,781
<font color="yellow">It was all my fault.</font>

492
00:50:55,991 --> 00:50:59,631
<font color="yellow">If only I had been stronger,
I would have been able to get rid of it.</font>

493
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:45,111
<font color="yellow">Monk Myung Chul.</font>

494
00:52:50,171 --> 00:52:52,792
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.</font>

495
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:56,542
<font color="yellow"><i>When the evil spirit came
out of Bong Pal's body</i></font>

496
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:59,441

497
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:01,522
<font color="yellow"><i>It is my biggest regret in life.</i></font>

498
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:04,892
<font color="yellow"><i>That evil spirit got so angry...</i></font>

499
00:53:07,252 --> 00:53:13,671
<font color="yellow"><i>it killed Bong Pal's mom
right in front of him.</i></font>

500
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:21,511
<font color="yellow">I learned that he started to
see ghosts from that moment on.</font>

501
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:27,491
<font color="yellow">Energy from that evil spirit
somehow stayed in his eyes.</font>

502
00:53:31,272 --> 00:53:35,022
<font color="yellow">Since that time, he's been
suffering from seeing ghosts.</font>

503
00:53:35,022 --> 00:53:41,350
<font color="yellow">He's been an outcast from his peers
because of his eyes.</font>

504
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,758
<font color="yellow">Do you think a ghost and a human
can possibly be together?</font>

505
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:51,792
<font color="yellow">So please leave Bong Pal,
for his own sake.</font>

00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:33,312
<font color="yellow">Yes? You're back?</font>

513
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,631
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm good.</font>

514
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,182
<font color="yellow">You didn't run into
Monk Myung Chul again, did you?</font>

515
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:50,602
<font color="yellow">I saw him briefly,
but I disappeared on him.</font>

516
00:55:50,602 --> 00:55:54,912
<font color="yellow">- Good.
- By the way, it's your birthday today?</font>

517
00:55:54,912 --> 00:55:56,991
<font color="yellow">Monk Myung Chul came back with a cake.</font>

518
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:59,361
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

519
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:03,182
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?
I had no idea.</font>

520
00:56:03,182 --> 00:56:05,182
<font color="yellow">Actually, I forgot.</font>

521
00:56:05,182 --> 00:56:09,502
<font color="yellow">- I don't usually celebrate my birthdays.
- Why not?</font>

522
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:12,712
<font color="yellow">I can't buy you anything</font>

523
00:56:12,712 --> 00:56:14,671
<font color="yellow">but is there any place you want to go?</font>

524
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,821
<font color="yellow">Let's spend your birthday together today.</font>

525
00:56:23,252 --> 00:56:25,941
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's so pretty.</font>

526
00:56:26,482 --> 00:56:28,252
<font color="yellow">It is pretty.</font>

527
00:56:29,491 --> 00:56:31,801
<font color="yellow">It's my first time on a cruise.</font>

528
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:34,441
<font color="yellow">I might have been on it
when I was alive, huh?</font>

529
00:56:35,631 --> 00:56:38,381
<font color="yellow">I also haven't been on one for a while.</font>

530
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:39,423
<font color="yellow">You haven't?</font>

531
00:56:40,582 --> 00:56:45,082
<font color="yellow">But I like it more
because you're with me now.</font>

532

<font color="yellow">It's about to start. Let's go see.</font>

534
00:57:14,772 --> 00:57:18,171

- Yes.</font>

535
00:57:30,852 --> 00:57:33,712
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.
- Yes?</font>

536
00:57:35,682 --> 00:57:38,432
<font color="yellow">I want you to be happy.</font>

537
00:57:38,432 --> 00:57:39,957
<font color="yellow">I'm happy now.</font>

538
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:45,350
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I haven't
celebrated my birthday before.</font>

539
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,602
<font color="yellow">I never liked it either.</font>

540
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:52,211
<font color="yellow">But I like my birthday now
because you're here with me.</font>

541
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:00,702
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

542

543
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:07,664
