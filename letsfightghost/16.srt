30

people, he is just a murderer.</font>

31
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:47,017
<font color="yellow">An evil spirit took over his body because
he had hatred in his heart at the start.</font>

00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,142
<font color="yellow">- Dad.
- Let's go inside.</font>

42
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:54,904
<font color="yellow">Young man, I clearly told you that
I do not like you seeing Hyun Ji.</font>

43
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,253
<font color="yellow">She's been in danger twice
already because of you.</font>

44
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,813
<font color="yellow">- What if she got hurt?
- I'm sorry.</font>

45
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,101
<font color="yellow">Mom, stop. Bong Pal did nothing wrong.</font>

46
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:07,517
<font color="yellow">Go inside the house with your dad.
Take her inside.</font>

47
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,236
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Honey.</font>

48
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,015
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Hyun Ji.</font>

49
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:28,733
<font color="yellow">We're going to leave here tomorrow.</font>

50

<font color="yellow">It's best for both of you.</font>

52
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,301
<font color="yellow">I believe you understand me.</font>

53
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,287
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

54
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,193
<font color="yellow">Please give this to Hyun Ji.</font>

55
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,921

64
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,666
<font color="yellow">I killed them.</font>

<font color="yellow">I...</font>

66
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,253
<font color="yellow">killed all these people.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hye Sung.</font>

68
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,067
<font color="yellow">Hye Sung.</font>

69
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:01,809
<font color="yellow">- You're home.
- Yes.</font>

70
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:08,979
<font color="yellow">Is it okay to drink when you're injured?</font>

71
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,911
<font color="yellow">There's no medicine for
getting beaten by a ghost.</font>

72
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,734
<font color="yellow">Alcohol is the best
to overcome the pain.</font>

73
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,807
<font color="yellow">There's no food either.</font>

74
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,748
<font color="yellow">Just wait a little bit.</font>

75
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,623
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

76
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:31,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this looks good.</font>

77
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:40,042
<font color="yellow">Wow, you really know how to cook.</font>

78
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,746
<font color="yellow">Is Hyun Ji leaving?</font>

79
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:48,147
<font color="yellow">Yes, she's leaving tomorrow.</font>

80
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,440
<font color="yellow">I see. It's time for everyone
to go back to their normal lives.</font>

81
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,325
<font color="yellow">You must be sad.</font>

82
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:57,051
<font color="yellow">- No, I'm fine.
- Good.</font>

83
00:10:57,052 --> 00:11:01,176
<font color="yellow">It's not like distance is going
to break you two apart, right?</font>

84
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:04,330
<font color="yellow">On days like this,
let's drink up and go to bed.</font>

85
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:10,003
<font color="yellow">Oh goodness.</font>

86
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,162
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

87
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,878
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it? I know it wasn't you.</font>

88
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:35,036
<font color="yellow">- Let's talk to the detective again--
- I did it.</font>

89
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:42,232
<font color="yellow">The crimes I committed in my heart are
bigger than the ones I physically did.</font>

90
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:47,816
<font color="yellow">If I didn't have those bad
intentions in my heart back then...</font>

91
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,849
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't have come to be like this.</font>

92
00:11:56,571 --> 00:11:58,466
<font color="yellow">My hand...</font>

93
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,959
<font color="yellow">I killed those people in my heart.</font>

94
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,835
<font color="yellow">That fact will never change.</font>

95
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,761
<font color="yellow">- Hye Sung.
- And...</font>

96
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,363
<font color="yellow">don't ever come here
again. If you see my face...</font>

97
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:17,247
<font color="yellow">It will only give you pain.</font>

98
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,291
<font color="yellow">No, it's not true.</font>

99
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:26,964
<font color="yellow">I'm going to come every day.</font>

100
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,612
<font color="yellow">I'm going to come and see you.</font>

101
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:32,759
<font color="yellow">I'm going to keep coming
until you forgive me.</font>

102
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:36,021
<font color="yellow">I'm going to come even
if you refuse to see me.</font>

103
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,932
<font color="yellow">I'm going to come every day to see you.</font>

104
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,088
<font color="yellow">- What's Hyun Ji doing?
- She's talking in her room.</font>

105
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,714
<font color="yellow">With who?</font>

106
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:25,762
<font color="yellow">- I swear.
- Leave her alone. It's the last time.</font>

107
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:36,194
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving today.</font>

108
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,554
<font color="yellow">Our stuff is all packed and ready to go.</font>

109
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,355
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

110
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,737
<font color="yellow">I hope you understand why Mom did that.</font>

111

<font color="yellow"><i>I completely understand.</i></font>

112
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,672
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't worry about it.</i></font>

113
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:54,185
<font color="yellow">- Thanks.
- <i>Study hard down there.</i></font>

114
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:59,607
<font color="yellow">- <i>That way we'll be able to meet quickly.</i>
- I will.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Hyun Ji, let's go.</i></font>

116

<font color="yellow">I have to go now.</font>

117
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:46,042
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji, get in.</font>

118
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:47,839
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

119
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,631
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't want to go.</i></font>

120
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,208
<font color="yellow"><i>I want to be with you.</i></font>

121
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,487
<font color="yellow">I don't want to send you off either.</font>

122
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:31,523
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you here to see me?</font>

123
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:34,583
<font color="yellow">I don't know when we'll
see each other again.</font>

124
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:39,127
<font color="yellow">- Don't you miss me?
- I do miss you.</font>

125
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:46,681
<font color="yellow">But I'm afraid I won't be able
to let you go if I see you.</font>

126
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,892
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.

156
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:33,901
<font color="yellow">That's okay, you can
just do better next time.</font>

157

you'll pass for sure next time.</font>

go to school with you.</font>

- You know what I'm talking about.</font>

- I don't know.</font>

going to live alone forever.</font>

173
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:18,709
<font color="yellow">By then, I'll have a stable career.</font>

174

00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,667
<font color="yellow">Who is this pitiful-looking man?</font>

297
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,394
<font color="yellow">Get rid of him.</font>

298
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,065
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

299
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:21,894
<font color="yellow">She's from Daeryong Mountain.</font>

300
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,723
<font color="yellow">She calls herself
the 1,000-year-old virgin shamaness.</font>

301
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,437
<font color="yellow">A virgin shamaness?</font>

302
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:28,680
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many?
She's not a virgin shamaness!</font>

303
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,341
<font color="yellow">She's just a con artist!</font>

304
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:35,475
<font color="yellow">You insolent fool! Leave immediately!</font>

305
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:39,492
<font color="yellow">You have no credentials or pedigree!
How dare you con these good people!</font>

306
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:43,142
<font color="yellow">How dare you call me a fraud!</font>

307
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:46,715
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you dragged this
good-for-nothing monk into the house!</font>

308
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:50,528
<font color="yellow">I'm a great and honorable
monk who catches evil spirits!</font>

309
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:53,986
<font color="yellow">Leave if you're done! How dare you
impersonate a shamaness, you fake.</font>

310
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:57,095
<font color="yellow">Fake? Fake?</font>

311
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:00,322
<font color="yellow">- Oh my.
- What's wrong?</font>

312
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:08,552
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

313
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:10,227
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

314
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:17,273
<font color="yellow">Goodness, attention!</font>

315
00:30:17,803 --> 00:30:19,789
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your promotion.</font>

316
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:22,775
<font color="yellow">Stop, you're embarrassing me.</font>

317
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:26,000
<font color="yellow">Chief.</font>

318
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,777
<font color="yellow">Chief.</font>

319
00:30:32,218 --> 00:30:34,228
<font color="yellow">Why did you push her?</font>

320
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:36,700
<font color="yellow">I didn't push her.</font>

321
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,594
<font color="yellow">This woman couldn't control her
anger and she tripped and fell.</font>

322
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:41,689
<font color="yellow">She says she's a virgin shamaness.</font>

323
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,969
<font color="yellow">Please check and see.
I think this woman is a fraud.</font>

324
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:51,341
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep hitting me, woman?</font>

325
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:56,267
<font color="yellow">Stop her! She's attacking me!</font>

326
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:59,489
<font color="yellow">Calm down!</font>

327
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:03,610
<font color="yellow">Have we met before?
You look familiar.</font>

328
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,401
<font color="yellow">- I go to church.
- Hallelujah?</font>

329
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:06,701
<font color="yellow">Amen.</font>

330
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:10,033
<font color="yellow">Stop her!</font>

331
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:14,456
<font color="yellow">- Senior.
- Senior.</font>

332
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,020
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

333
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:18,913
<font color="yellow">- I'm going home.
- Don't go home.</font>

334
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:21,556
<font color="yellow">There's the freshman
welcome party today.</font>

335
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:22,931
<font color="yellow">Ah.</font>

336
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:25,671
<font color="yellow">- I'm not interested in those events.
- No, you have to go.</font>

337
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,266
<font color="yellow">You have to be there.</font>

338
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,650
<font color="yellow">- Please go.
- Let's go together.</font>

339
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:32,881
<font color="yellow">Senior, let's go.</font>

340
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:35,269
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

341
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:37,798
<font color="yellow">Are all the drinks poured?</font>

342
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,106
<font color="yellow">- Do you all have drinks or not?
- We do!</font>

343
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,694
<font color="yellow">It's rare to drink with us seniors!</font>

344
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:46,374
<font color="yellow">Economy major cheer on
the count of three, got it?</font>

345
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,025
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- One, two, three!</font>

346
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,604
<font color="yellow">Economy major!</font>

347
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,759
<font color="yellow">There is a really pretty freshman
girl who got admitted this year.</font>

348
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,199
<font color="yellow">I saw her too. She's totally hot.</font>

349
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:02,456
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm economy major
Kim Ji Eun, class of 2018.</font>

350
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:04,749
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of me.</font>

351
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:10,624
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm economy major...</font>

352
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,586
<font color="yellow">- She's so cute.
- Please take good care of me.</font>

353
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:18,558
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm economy major
Lee Dong Min, class of 2018.</font>

354
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,981
<font color="yellow">It's my goal to become
the Adam Smith of Korea. Thank you.</font>

355
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:28,867
<font color="yellow">Hello, Seniors. I'm economy
major Kim Hyun Ji, class of 2018.</font>

356
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,874
<font color="yellow">I'd appreciate your guidance.</font>

357
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,619
<font color="yellow">Hey, she's the one!</font>

358
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,217
<font color="yellow">- I have a question.
- Yes?</font>

359
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:38,523
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you have a boyfriend?</font>

360
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,296
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's here.</font>

361
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,855
<font color="yellow">He's here?</font>

362
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:02,698
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie about not passing?</font>

363
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:06,258
<font color="yellow">I did it on purpose
so I could surprise you.</font>

364
00:33:06,874 --> 00:33:10,343
<font color="yellow">I had no idea. I was wondering how
I was going to wait another year.</font>

365
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:11,870
<font color="yellow">You said it'll pass soon enough.</font>

366
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,888
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean it.</font>

367
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:18,500
<font color="yellow">But where are you staying?</font>

368
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,590
<font color="yellow">At my uncle's.
It's close to your place too.</font>

369
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:22,569
<font color="yellow">Really? Good.</font>

370
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:27,109
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Of course.</font>

371
00:33:28,246 --> 00:33:31,650
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'm going
to stick to you like glue.</font>

372
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:34,390
<font color="yellow">You better be good to me from now on.</font>

373
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:36,388
<font color="yellow">- Older sister?
- Of course, I'm older than you.</font>

374
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,008
<font color="yellow">You're one year younger than me.</font>

375
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:41,538
<font color="yellow">Older sister, my butt.</font>

376
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,533
<font color="yellow">Let's get the nicknames out of the way.</font>

377
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:47,484
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, repeat after me.</font>

378
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,614
<font color="yellow">Older sister.</font>

379
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,919
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

380
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,667
<font color="yellow">You better listen to me.
One more time. "Older sister."</font>

381
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:59,201
<font color="yellow">- Forget it.
- Why? Just say it once, okay?</font>

382
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:00,892
<font color="yellow">Older sister. Older sister.</font>

383
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:03,152
<font color="yellow">- No, I don't want to!
- Say "older sister"!</font>

384
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:05,100
<font color="yellow">Just say it this once. Please?</font>

385
00:34:15,337 --> 00:34:18,698
<font color="yellow">- Now go in.
- Okay.</font>

386
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,908
<font color="yellow">- Good night.
- Good night.</font>

387
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,685
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter?
- I just like you so much.</font>

388
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:54,446
<font color="yellow">I like you a lot too.</font>

389
00:35:02,263 --> 00:35:05,203
<font color="yellow">- Go in now.
- All right.</font>

390
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,372
<font color="yellow">- Sweet dreams.
- You too.</font>

391
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:27,388
<font color="yellow">Hi, Monk Myung Chul.</font>

392
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:34,377
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

393
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:37,038
<font color="yellow">Where is Monk Myung Chul?</font>

394
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:44,457
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

395
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:53,227
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

396
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:56,747
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're not a kid.</font>

397
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:58,477
<font color="yellow">How could you get into a fight, huh?</font>

398
00:35:58,477 --> 00:36:00,828
<font color="yellow">In my field, there are
business ethics to follow.</font>

399
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,317
<font color="yellow">That shamaness didn't do it.</font>

400
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:04,508
<font color="yellow">That's why I... taught her a lesson.</font>

401
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:08,828
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. I will go now.
- Monk Myung Chul.</font>

402
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,718
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- Well...</font>

403
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,897
<font color="yellow">You're not well and all.</font>

404
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:17,627
<font color="yellow">Why don't you stop working?</font>

405
00:36:17,837 --> 00:36:20,508
<font color="yellow">Stop working and stay with me.</font>

406
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:22,587
<font color="yellow">- With you?
- Yes.</font>

407
00:36:22,587 --> 00:36:25,308
<font color="yellow">Your place in the mountain
isn't very comfortable.</font>

408
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:27,518
<font color="yellow">I emptied the spare room.</font>

409
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,258
<font color="yellow">Move in with me. I know it's such
a hassle to commute back and forth.</font>

410
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:32,457
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

411
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:36,127
<font color="yellow">You're the only family member I have now.</font>

412
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:38,127
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

413
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:47,158
<font color="yellow">You know how to make people cry, huh?</font>

414
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:51,268
<font color="yellow">Do you have any sausage at home?</font>

415
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:55,047
<font color="yellow">On a day like this, it'll be great
to have soju and sausage.</font>

416
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:58,868
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

417
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:14,468
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

418
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:29,158
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji!</font>

419
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:31,238
<font color="yellow">Hey, Soo Jin.</font>

420
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:34,008
<font color="yellow">Do you have time tonight?</font>

421
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:35,738
<font color="yellow">What? What about tonight?</font>

422
00:37:35,738 --> 00:37:37,948
<font color="yellow">Management department guys
asked three girls out on a blind date.</font>

423
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:40,357
<font color="yellow">- Can you please come with us?
- A blind date?</font>

424
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:44,337
<font color="yellow">Well, you know I have a boyfriend.</font>

425
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:47,747
<font color="yellow">We know that you're going out
with one of our seniors.</font>

426
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:50,707
<font color="yellow">Can you keep this from him
and come out with us this once?</font>

427
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:52,788
<font color="yellow">We were afraid
the guys would be a disaster.</font>

428
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:54,518
<font color="yellow">So we told them we'd bring
the prettiest girl in our department.</font>

429
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:57,227
<font color="yellow">They told me that they'd bring
the handsomest boys. Please.</font>

430
00:37:57,227 --> 00:38:00,027
<font color="yellow">Come on, me the prettiest girl?</font>

431
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,207
<font color="yellow">If Bong Pal finds out,
he will get really mad.</font>

432
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:05,008
<font color="yellow">Once people know you two are going out</font>

433
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:06,357
<font color="yellow">you will never be asked
on a blind date.</font>

434
00:38:06,357 --> 00:38:09,667
<font color="yellow">You got into college and will graduate
without being on a blind date?</font>

435
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:14,957
<font color="yellow">Wow, she is really pretty.</font>

436
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,768
<font color="yellow">With the other two,
she looks even prettier.</font>

437
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:23,698
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm a freshman in
the Management department, Kim Tae Young.</font>

438
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:25,988
<font color="yellow">You're as pretty as we've heard.</font>

439
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:28,218
<font color="yellow">Really? Thank you.</font>

440
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:30,928
<font color="yellow">What is this? Only three boys were
supposed to come meet us.</font>

441
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:33,848
<font color="yellow">They all begged me to come along.</font>

442
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:36,047
<font color="yellow">We managed to cut many others.</font>

443
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:41,988
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

Where are you?</i></font>

450
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:21,848
<font color="yellow">Let's break the ice, shall we?</font>

451
00:39:21,848 --> 00:39:24,308
<font color="yellow">Can we go around
and introduce ourselves first?</font>

452
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:27,268
<font color="yellow">- Sure.
- Me first?</font>

453
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:30,937
<font color="yellow">What homework all of a sudden?</font>

454
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,768
<font color="yellow">I guess I will just go then.</font>

455
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:44,607
<font color="yellow">Drink up! Drink up!</font>

456
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:48,078

- A knight to the rescue.</font>

<font color="yellow">- I can drink this.
- No way.</font>

460
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:09,207

go on a blind date at college.</font>

483

485
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:29,917
<font color="yellow">You went on a blind date
and you want me to let it go?</font>

486
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,408
<font color="yellow">- I told them that I had a boyfriend.
- What?</font>

487

I told them I had a boyfriend.</font>

go ask them.</font>

the craziness of college life.</font>

<font color="yellow">- You got into college for this, did you?
- Yes.</font>

491
00:42:44,238 --> 00:42:46,147
<font color="yellow">- Why else?
- Oh my.</font>

492
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,758
<font color="yellow">I was kidding.</font>

493
00:42:48,788 --> 00:42:50,518

- You laughed, didn't you?</font>

501
00:43:18,308 --> 00:43:21,127
<font color="yellow">- I did not laugh.
- Yes, you did.</font>

- Come on, you so laughed.</font>

503
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:26,908
<font color="yellow">- Hey, you laughed.
- No, I did not.</font>

504
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:33,738
<font color="yellow">I hate to say goodbye.</font>

505
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:36,468

<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal, just go.
- What?</font>

509
00:43:51,618 --> 00:43:54,497
<font color="yellow">If my mom sees you,
she might say something.</font>

510
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:57,747
<font color="yellow">- Get home safe. I will go.
- Hyun Ji.</font>

511
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,328
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing?</font>

512
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:05,968
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, hold on.</font>

513
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:07,788
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

514
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:21,018
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello...</font>

515
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:24,218
<font color="yellow">I heard you came up to Seoul.</font>

516
00:44:24,218 --> 00:44:26,058
<font color="yellow">I wanted to come by to say hi.</font>

517
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:31,527
<font color="yellow">Ah, did you?</font>

518
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:34,518
<font color="yellow">Why don't you come in?</font>

519
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:46,457
<font color="yellow">By the way, isn't it too late
for you to hang out at this hour?</font>

520
00:44:46,457 --> 00:44:49,218
<font color="yellow">Mom, please don't say anything to him.</font>

521
00:44:50,808 --> 00:44:53,277
<font color="yellow">Did you come by because you
wanted to tell me something?</font>

522
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:56,868
<font color="yellow">I have a feeling that you didn't
just come by to say hi...</font>

523
00:44:58,857 --> 00:45:00,618
<font color="yellow">Well, ma'am...</font>

524
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:10,087
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji and I'd like to get
your permission to go out officially.</font>

525
00:45:10,158 --> 00:45:15,388
<font color="yellow">Well, haven't you two been going out
without my permission all this time?</font>

526
00:45:15,388 --> 00:45:18,727
<font color="yellow">No, we haven't seen
each other all this time.</font>

527
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:20,497
<font color="yellow">Can you stay out of it for now?</font>

528
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:24,272
<font color="yellow">Are you sincerely asking
for my permission?</font>

529
00:45:24,272 --> 00:45:26,527
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

530
00:45:26,538 --> 00:45:29,247
<font color="yellow">Then if I tell you not to see her</font>

531
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:31,457
<font color="yellow">will you never see her again?</font>

532
00:45:31,727 --> 00:45:32,937
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

533
00:45:32,937 --> 00:45:36,808
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I didn't have a good feeling
about you from the beginning.</font>

534
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:38,698
<font color="yellow">When my daughter came back
from near death</font>

535
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:41,457
<font color="yellow">you showed up out of nowhere
and followed her saying you liked her.</font>

536
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:45,377
<font color="yellow">What parents wouldn't
be suspicious to accept you?</font>

537
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:48,337
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

538
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:04,718
<font color="yellow">Mom, are you serious?</font>

539
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:08,187
<font color="yellow">- You mean it, right?
- Yes.</font>

540
00:46:08,187 --> 00:46:09,917
<font color="yellow">You got into college
and are all grown up now.</font>

541
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:11,428
<font color="yellow">How can I possibly stop you?</font>

542
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,198
<font color="yellow">Well, he doesn't seem like a bad boy.</font>

543
00:46:14,198 --> 00:46:16,087
<font color="yellow">Of course not. He's a very nice person.</font>

544
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,448
<font color="yellow">Plus, he does so well in school.</font>

545
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:19,997
<font color="yellow">He has a full scholarship
for all four years.</font>

546
00:46:19,997 --> 00:46:21,997
<font color="yellow">And there aren't any sports he can't do.</font>

547
00:46:21,997 --> 00:46:24,468
<font color="yellow">- You like him that much?
- Yes, I do like him.</font>

548
00:46:25,638 --> 00:46:28,408
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mom. I love you, too.</font>

549
00:46:29,058 --> 00:46:31,087
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
You're too big for this.</font>

550
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:32,758
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

551
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:42,997
<font color="yellow">Today, Mrs. Yang
went out of her way to make this.</font>

552
00:46:43,738 --> 00:46:45,518
<font color="yellow">Try.</font>

553
00:46:54,598 --> 00:46:57,627
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, officer.</font>

554
00:46:58,948 --> 00:47:00,727
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

555
00:47:15,408 --> 00:47:18,107
<font color="yellow">I made it when we had time for crafts.</font>

556
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:21,638
<font color="yellow">If you don't like it,
you don't have to wear it.</font>

557
00:47:28,457 --> 00:47:30,618
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

558
00:47:31,277 --> 00:47:33,857
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty.</font>

559
00:47:46,337 --> 00:47:52,868
<font color="yellow">It seems that it took us
too long to get to this point.</font>

560
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:56,868
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Hye Sung.</font>

561
00:47:58,178 --> 00:48:00,957
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself anymore.</font>

562
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:08,738
<font color="yellow">Now I am not angry or resentful anymore.</font>

563
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:18,647
<font color="yellow">We can't go back</font>

564
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:24,187
<font color="yellow">but let's share what we couldn't before.</font>

565
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:27,758
<font color="yellow">Let's do that, Hye Sung.</font>

566
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:36,207
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

567
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,508
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

568
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,607
<font color="yellow">- Then...
- See you later.</font>

569
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:02,607
<font color="yellow">Sure, have a good day.</font>

570
00:49:29,288 --> 00:49:31,518
<font color="yellow">I'm not picking this up.</font>

571
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:34,908
<font color="yellow">- I'm here to throw this away.
- I didn't say anything.</font>

572
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:37,247
<font color="yellow">I guess something is bothering you.</font>

573
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:39,448
<font color="yellow">What? Nothing is bothering me.</font>

574
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,558
<font color="yellow">Now that I look at your face this way</font>

575
00:49:58,558 --> 00:50:00,538
<font color="yellow">I see you have a face for good fortune.</font>

576
00:50:00,538 --> 00:50:02,247
<font color="yellow">Um, do I?</font>

577
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:05,238
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't hurt yourself at your age.
Pleae be careful.</font>

578
00:50:10,038 --> 00:50:11,868
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

579
00:50:19,578 --> 00:50:22,008
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

580
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:24,317
<font color="yellow">Come on.
I'm so out of your league.</font>

581
00:50:24,317 --> 00:50:26,968
<font color="yellow">Well, he has an eye for beauty, I guess.</font>

582
00:50:34,928 --> 00:50:38,538
<font color="yellow">Oh my, I'm sorry.</font>

583
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:40,127
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

584
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,627
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

585
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:49,268
<font color="yellow">Haven't we met before?</font>

586
00:50:49,268 --> 00:50:51,198
<font color="yellow">Do you know me?</font>

587
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:52,997
<font color="yellow">Se Ri!</font>

588
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:59,038
<font color="yellow">- Se Ri.
- Hon, what took you so long?</font>

589
00:50:59,038 --> 00:51:01,187
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for so long.</font>

590
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:03,777
<font color="yellow">I can't go out with someone
who isn't punctual.</font>

591
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:07,348
<font color="yellow">You're mad, aren't you?
I'm very sorry.</font>

592
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:10,067
<font color="yellow">- Hon, let me carry them for you.
-<i> Honey!</i></font>

593
00:51:10,428 --> 00:51:12,837
<font color="yellow">What is this guy doing here again?</font>

594
00:51:14,247 --> 00:51:16,437
<font color="yellow">Honey, I was wrong.</font>

595
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:18,437
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me this once.</font>

596
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:21,308
<font color="yellow">Why won't you leave
me alone? So irritating.</font>

597
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:23,308
<font color="yellow">I told you that we were done.</font>

598
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:25,968
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

599
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:28,087
<font color="yellow">Se Ri doesn't want you.</font>

600
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:30,238
<font color="yellow">Because of you, she's changed.</font>

601
00:51:30,238 --> 00:51:32,837
<font color="yellow">Why did you come on to her, huh?</font>

602
00:51:32,837 --> 00:51:35,437
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I came on to her?</font>

603
00:51:36,538 --> 00:51:39,997
<font color="yellow">Be a man and get lost, will you?</font>

604
00:51:41,187 --> 00:51:43,488
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
- Se Ri.</font>

605
00:51:46,058 --> 00:51:48,268
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.
- Seo Yeon.</font>

606
00:51:48,268 --> 00:51:50,538
<font color="yellow">- Long time no see.
- It sure has been.</font>

607
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:52,758
<font color="yellow">I heard you got a job.</font>

608
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:56,497
<font color="yellow">- At a good company, I hear.
- Well, I'm just doing an internship.</font>

609
00:51:56,497 --> 00:51:57,837
<font color="yellow">What brings you here at school?</font>

610
00:51:57,837 --> 00:52:01,317
<font color="yellow">- I needed to get some academic papers.
- Academic papers?</font>

611
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:03,808
<font color="yellow">Honey, what are you doing here?</font>

612
00:52:04,328 --> 00:52:07,377
<font color="yellow">- You're the one from last time...
- Hi, I'm his girlfriend.</font>

613
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:09,868
<font color="yellow">Ah, you have a girlfriend now, huh?</font>

614
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:11,997
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations. You two look good.
- Thank you.</font>

615
00:52:11,997 --> 00:52:13,527
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

616
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:16,917
<font color="yellow">- I will see you later.
- See you later.</font>

617
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,788
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

618
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,317
<font color="yellow">Don't smile like that.
You look like a fool.</font>

619
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:27,027
<font color="yellow">I didn't smile.</font>

620
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:31,777
<font color="yellow">By the way, can you call me that again?</font>

621
00:52:31,777 --> 00:52:33,527
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

622
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:37,538
<font color="yellow">Hey, please.</font>

623
00:52:37,538 --> 00:52:40,928
<font color="yellow">Hey, call me by that name again.</font>

624
00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:44,317
<font color="yellow">Aren't you late for your class?</font>

625
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:47,777
<font color="yellow">I'm late. Excuse me. Sorry.</font>

626
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:51,777
<font color="yellow">Honey, pay attention in your class.</font>

627
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:07,207
<font color="yellow">How come there is
so much fat in this pork? I hate it.</font>

628
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:09,808
<font color="yellow">I like the stew with tuna in it.</font>

629
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:12,837
<font color="yellow">- Kimchi stew is better with pork in it.
- I agree. Isn't it?</font>

630
00:53:12,837 --> 00:53:15,877
<font color="yellow">That was an insult to pork kimchi stew.</font>

631
00:53:16,917 --> 00:53:19,988
<font color="yellow">- Kimchi stew is better with pork.
- I agree. Isn't it?</font>

632
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,837
<font color="yellow">That was an insult to pork kimchi stew.</font>

633
00:53:24,518 --> 00:53:25,727
<font color="yellow">When we're talking about kimchi stew</font>

634
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:28,468
<font color="yellow">it's obvious pork kimchi stew
is the best, isn't it?</font>

635
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:33,118
<font color="yellow">When the juice from the pork
meets sour and spicy kimchi</font>

636
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:36,038
<font color="yellow">it gives the stew deep flavor.</font>

637
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:39,098
<font color="yellow">- She doesn't know that, huh?
- I agree.</font>

638
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:41,618
<font color="yellow">Why would she throw away such good stuff?</font>

639
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,457
<font color="yellow">You seem to know
about deep meat flavor, huh?</font>

640
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:46,687
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to know that
at our age, don't you think?</font>

641
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,817
<font color="yellow">I'm Goo Dae Hyung, a sophomore
in the physical education department.</font>

642
00:53:50,817 --> 00:53:53,047
<font color="yellow">- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.</font>

643
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:55,788
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen your pretty face
around here. You must be a freshman.</font>

644
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:57,417
<font color="yellow">- I am.
- A freshman, huh?</font>

645
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:59,788
<font color="yellow">- Did you join any clubs yet?
- Not yet.</font>

646
00:53:59,788 --> 00:54:03,428
<font color="yellow">Not yet? Why don't you
join our club then?</font>

647
00:54:03,428 --> 00:54:04,667
<font color="yellow">What kind of club is it?</font>

648
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:07,018
<font color="yellow">It's a club where we work
together to learn new flavors.</font>

649
00:54:07,018 --> 00:54:08,647
<font color="yellow">It's called "Let's Eat."</font>

650
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:11,437
<font color="yellow">Among the nessecities of life,
food, clothing, and shelter</font>

651
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:15,417
<font color="yellow">food means more than
just feeding ourselves.</font>

652
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:18,877
<font color="yellow">It not only satisfies
our desire to feed ourselves</font>

653
00:54:18,877 --> 00:54:25,118
<font color="yellow">but also helps with stress from social
lives and loneliness from isolation.</font>

654
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:31,488
<font color="yellow">So our club is sort of promoting
the pleasure of dining together.</font>

655
00:54:31,488 --> 00:54:32,763
<font color="yellow">So what do you think?
Doesn't it sound fun?</font>

656
00:54:32,763 --> 00:54:34,038
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

657
00:54:35,797 --> 00:54:38,658
<font color="yellow">- Hello, senior.
- How dare you?</font>

658
00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:41,828
<font color="yellow">You just got up in the middle of
trying to sell medicine?</font>

659
00:54:42,538 --> 00:54:46,087
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Plus, you punk...</font>

660
00:54:46,098 --> 00:54:49,758
<font color="yellow">You can't recruit people
at a sacred place like the cafeteria.</font>

661
00:54:49,758 --> 00:54:51,538
<font color="yellow">Where are your ethics?</font>

662
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:54,538
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Go over there and stay.</font>

663
00:54:54,538 --> 00:54:56,508
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji here will have an upset stomach.</font>

664
00:54:56,508 --> 00:54:58,297
<font color="yellow">I will. Please enjoy your lunch.</font>

665
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:08,258
<font color="yellow">Ones who are so smooth
with words are not to be trusted.</font>

666
00:55:08,258 --> 00:55:12,835
<font color="yellow">You're not going to fall for
what he says and join his club, are you?</font>

667
00:55:12,835 --> 00:55:15,578
<font color="yellow">- It'll be a disaster.
- Of course not.</font>

668
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:19,158
<font color="yellow">In Rang graduated,
but why are you still here?</font>

669
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:22,897
<font color="yellow">You can't talk about it so openly.</font>

670
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:24,997
<font color="yellow">It's top secret.</font>

671
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:33,598
<font color="yellow">Actually, do you have time after lunch?</font>

672
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:36,988
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

673
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:51,738
<font color="yellow"><i>[Life and Sundae Soup]</i></font>

674
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:07,268
<font color="yellow">You've been given such
a fantastic opportunity to be here.</font>

675
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:12,567
<font color="yellow">Now your life will be divided into</font>

676
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:17,587
<font color="yellow">before and after
you experience Sundae Soup.</font>

677
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:20,158
<font color="yellow">Kim In Rang.</font>

678
00:56:32,718 --> 00:56:35,207
<font color="yellow">These are
the light refreshments we prepared.</font>

679
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:37,437
<font color="yellow">I hope you enjoy them.</font>

680
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:52,917
<font color="yellow">Here we go again.</font>

681
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,797
<font color="yellow">By the way,
Chun Sang isn't a student, is he?</font>

682
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:57,658
<font color="yellow">Isn't he a scam artist?</font>

683
00:57:03,147 --> 00:57:07,448
<font color="yellow">By promoting
academic-industrial collaboration</font>

684
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:10,768
<font color="yellow">we, Sundae Soup, contribute to
local and national development</font>

685
00:57:10,768 --> 00:57:15,538
<font color="yellow">and lead innovative cultural tradition.</font>

686
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:19,138
<font color="yellow">In doing so, we'd like to
contribute to your bright future.</font>

687
00:57:23,618 --> 00:57:27,158
<font color="yellow">Once you join our Sundae Soup...</font>

688
00:57:27,158 --> 00:57:28,738
<font color="yellow">No need to listen anymore. Let's go.</font>

689
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:31,018
<font color="yellow">Top-notch multi-communication.</font>

690
00:57:31,018 --> 00:57:34,948
<font color="yellow">We provide speedy and accurate service.</font>

691
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:37,908
<font color="yellow">We provide 24-hour exorcism services.</font>

692
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:40,258
<font color="yellow">We can do it all. Where...</font>

693
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:42,509
<font color="yellow">Hey...</font>

694
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:43,895
<font color="yellow">Hey guys, Bong Pal.</font>

695
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:47,977
<font color="yellow">How could you just leave?</font>

696
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:49,227
<font color="yellow">We still have part two.</font>

697
00:57:49,227 --> 00:57:51,747
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to join any clubs.</font>

698
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:54,828
<font color="yellow">- Why not?
- I need to study hard so I can graduate.</font>

699
00:57:57,448 --> 00:58:01,317
<font color="yellow">Gosh, isn't this too harsh?</font>

700
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:03,727
<font color="yellow">You don't want to be the president
or even join the club?</font>

701
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:06,268
<font color="yellow">Why don't we just
get rid of the club then?</font>

702
00:58:06,268 --> 00:58:08,268
<font color="yellow">But we can still work together, huh?</font>

703
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:10,448
<font color="yellow">We couldn't do any work without you two.</font>

704
00:58:10,448 --> 00:58:14,598
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal, Hyun Ji.
We're begging you this once.</font>

705
00:58:14,598 --> 00:58:16,178
<font color="yellow">If our business goes bankrupt</font>

706
00:58:16,178 --> 00:58:20,607
<font color="yellow">I will owe my grandma so much
and she will break his arms and legs.</font>

707
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:25,154
<font color="yellow">She will break them.</font>

708
00:58:25,154 --> 00:58:27,437
<font color="yellow">Please save my arms and legs.</font>

709
00:58:27,897 --> 00:58:29,908
<font color="yellow">If we work together</font>

710
00:58:29,908 --> 00:58:31,707
<font color="yellow">we could really hit a jackpot.</font>

711
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:33,928
<font color="yellow">Chun Sang, it's just that...</font>

712
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:38,707
<font color="yellow">- I don't need money anymore.
- Me neither.</font>

713
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:44,437
<font color="yellow">Guys, it's not about money, you know.</font>

714
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,118
<font color="yellow">You need to keep in mind that</font>

715
00:58:46,118 --> 00:58:49,638
<font color="yellow">we're not doing this
to make money, right?</font>

716
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:59,027
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten
the sacred idea of Sundae Soup?</font>

717
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:04,587
<font color="yellow">Like a pot that is boiling 24 hours
at a rice soup restaurant</font>

718
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:08,158
<font color="yellow">let's try to help
those who are suffering.</font>

719
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:09,808
<font color="yellow">What do you think about the idea?</font>

720
00:59:09,808 --> 00:59:13,437
<font color="yellow">Did you already forget our promise?</font>

721
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:16,587
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal. Hyun Ji.</font>

722
00:59:17,348 --> 00:59:20,817
<font color="yellow">Your power comes
with great responsibilities.</font>

723
00:59:26,948 --> 00:59:30,718
<font color="yellow">Will you really let
your power go to waste?</font>

724
00:59:30,718 --> 00:59:34,578
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many kids
are waiting to be rescued?</font>

725
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:36,187
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

726
00:59:40,198 --> 00:59:43,607
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is 24-hour
exorcism service, Sundae Soup.</font>

727
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:48,277
<font color="yellow">I'm a representative, Kim In Rang.
How may I help you?</font>

728
00:59:50,038 --> 00:59:54,837
<font color="yellow">A ghost? A ghost?</font>

729
00:59:54,837 --> 00:59:57,917
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt? Calm down.
Take a big breath.</font>

730
00:59:57,917 --> 01:00:00,127
<font color="yellow">Where are you at?
I will come right over.</font>

731
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,317
<font color="yellow">I understand. All right then.</font>

732
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:06,328
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what do we do?</font>

733
01:00:06,968 --> 01:00:09,098
<font color="yellow">These people's cry.</font>

734
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:16,147
<font color="yellow">We can shine some light on their misery.</font>

735
01:00:16,768 --> 01:00:18,437
<font color="yellow">Let's do it together.</font>

736
01:00:18,437 --> 01:00:20,618
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, please.
- Please.</font>

737
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:24,477
<font color="yellow">Someone is hurt.</font>

738
01:00:25,437 --> 01:00:29,218
<font color="yellow">- Bong Pal.
- Yes?</font>

739
01:00:30,678 --> 01:00:33,747
<font color="yellow">What Chun Sang was saying
isn't entirely wrong.</font>

740
01:00:35,138 --> 01:00:37,038
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

741
01:00:37,828 --> 01:00:40,868
<font color="yellow">It's hard to see ghosts.</font>

742
01:00:40,868 --> 01:00:43,337
<font color="yellow">But we can help them at the same time.</font>

743
01:00:43,908 --> 01:00:46,527
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to help ghosts?</font>

744
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:49,627
<font color="yellow">Aren't they the same as us?</font>

745
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:54,538
<font color="yellow">They haven't crossed over to the other
side and are just lost right now.</font>

746
01:00:56,147 --> 01:00:58,098
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

747
01:00:58,098 --> 01:01:00,448
<font color="yellow">Not all ghosts are bad.</font>

748
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:08,058
<font color="yellow">They have their pain
and sadness just like us.</font>

749
01:01:29,678 --> 01:01:32,868
<font color="yellow">My son. My son.</font>

750
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:05,738
<font color="yellow">- Monk Myung Chul.
- Yes?</font>

751
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:09,428
<font color="yellow">Why do you exorcise?</font>

752
01:02:09,428 --> 01:02:12,277
<font color="yellow">It's a tough job, but doesn't pay much.</font>

753
01:02:16,008 --> 01:02:19,317
<font color="yellow">I help with the lingering attachment
of the ghosts who can't leave yet.</font>

754
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:22,437
<font color="yellow">I help get rid of people's fear.</font>

755
01:02:22,437 --> 01:02:26,488
<font color="yellow">That way, everybody finds their way back.</font>

756
01:02:26,488 --> 01:02:28,488
<font color="yellow">They go back to the places
where they belong.</font>

757
01:02:28,488 --> 01:02:29,917
<font color="yellow">That's why I do it.</font>

758
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:34,107
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can do the job?</font>

759
01:02:36,308 --> 01:02:38,178
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

760
01:02:39,317 --> 01:02:41,297
<font color="yellow">When I found out that
you'd go around exorcising</font>

761
01:02:41,297 --> 01:02:43,598
<font color="yellow">do you know why I was so against that?</font>

762
01:02:45,357 --> 01:02:46,658
<font color="yellow">Not sure.</font>

763
01:02:46,658 --> 01:02:49,897
<font color="yellow">It was because I could see
hatred in your eyes then.</font>

764
01:02:49,897 --> 01:02:52,937
<font color="yellow">You can't see the world right
when you have so much anger in you.</font>

765
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:54,937
<font color="yellow">You were hurt by ghosts.</font>

766
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,288
<font color="yellow">But not all ghosts are bad.</font>

767
01:02:57,288 --> 01:03:00,207
<font color="yellow">In a way, we should feel sorry for them.</font>

768
01:03:00,207 --> 01:03:02,957
<font color="yellow">Are you asking if you can do the job?</font>

769
01:03:03,328 --> 01:03:05,997
<font color="yellow">It's up to you what you think.</font>

770
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:12,008
<font color="yellow">Making others happy makes you happiest.</font>

771
01:03:12,008 --> 01:03:14,408
<font color="yellow">If your eyes can give the dead ones peace</font>

772
01:03:14,408 --> 01:03:18,607
<font color="yellow">you're not cursed,
but you have a special gift.</font>

773
01:03:23,377 --> 01:03:27,127
<font color="yellow">By the way, it's so unlike you
that you're saying all good things.</font>

774
01:03:27,127 --> 01:03:29,607
<font color="yellow">When do I ever say bad things, punk?</font>

775
01:03:30,178 --> 01:03:32,768
<font color="yellow">- I think this is your first time.
- What?</font>

776
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,417
<font color="yellow">Please continue.</font>

777
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:40,468
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's so good.</font>

778
01:03:40,468 --> 01:03:43,547
<font color="yellow">- This is really nice.
- Yes.</font>

779
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:46,178
<font color="yellow">How long has it been?</font>

780
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:49,337
<font color="yellow">Seriously, how long has it been?</font>

781
01:03:49,337 --> 01:03:52,928
<font color="yellow">I love going together like this!</font>

782
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:56,607
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji. Bong Pal.</font>

783
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:59,397
<font color="yellow">Let's do this for the rest of our lives!</font>

784
01:03:59,397 --> 01:04:01,227
<font color="yellow">Do this forever!</font>

785
01:04:03,187 --> 01:04:05,227
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

786
01:04:40,078 --> 01:04:41,797
<font color="yellow">Bong Pal.</font>

787
01:04:42,788 --> 01:04:44,317
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

788
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,288
<font color="yellow">Why did you change your mind so suddenly?</font>

789
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:51,497
<font color="yellow">- I want to know.
- Know what?</font>

790
01:04:51,497 --> 01:04:54,008
<font color="yellow">The reason why we can see ghosts.</font>

791
01:04:56,357 --> 01:04:57,997
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

792
01:05:04,797 --> 01:05:08,997
<font color="yellow">- Let's fight ghosts!
- Let's fight ghosts!</font>
