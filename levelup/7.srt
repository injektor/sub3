<i> Episode 7</i>

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,230
We had a beer together just now,

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,290
Manager Shin is missing and she 
doesn't answer the calls.

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,410
Yeon Hwa, what are you doing here? 
And you are not reachable.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,080
I'm not in the mood to talk.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,780
Yeon Hwa.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,310
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,210
I'm so sorry.

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,190
Han Chul, why are you sorry for me?

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,950
I couldn't stop it.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,500
So could I.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,430
I am mad at myself who couldn't stop.

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,270
So don't feel sorry, Han Chul.

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,470
I know.

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,750
But still, it feels it's my mistake.

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,450
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,690
Do you feel better now?

20
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,480
I cry so often in front of you.

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Right.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm thankful that you were caring for me.

23
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,360
Why smile?

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,830
No worries.

25
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,720
Let's go!

26
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,500
Not yet. It doesn't feel right yet.

27
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,940
It's not 100%. There is one thing I still can't remember.

28
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,870
Excuse me, CEO. Ya Chae is on her way to pick you up.

29
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,820
I'm cold.

30
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,540
Hold on, get up. Let's wait inside.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,700
Can you stay next to me, just like this?

32
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,260
Yeah?

33
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,980
I'm cold.

34
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,290
CEO, you seems drunk...

35
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,230
Stay here with me, mom.

36
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,660
I'm not your mom...

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,740
Don't go mom.

38
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,410
You son is well grown up.

39
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,930
No no no. I'm not the mom!

40
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,830
Oh no.

41
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,790
Yes, thank you.

42
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,890
Gently, please.

43
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,900
Wow you're full of energy, this is heavy.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,800
Inside, put them inside.

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,570
Uh?

46
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,960
Hello!

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,320
You are here! What about other teams?

48
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,820
They will be here soon.

49
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,370
The stuffs are here early.

50
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,320
These are the first round, couple more times to come.

51
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Hey, that should be out last.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,900
I had no idea I would be doing an urban life I've dreamt of like this.

53
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,190
Tho it's better, we were worried.

54
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,960
Let's move first. We have a long day ahead us!

55
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,980
Wait what's this?

56
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,530
I mean the management team will use the upper level?

57
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,000
Are they gonna monitor us or what?

58
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,410
That's the random ping pong table in the middle of the office.

59
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,510
It's for employees' indoor sports activity.

60
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,660
Whenever you want, go enjoy!

61
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,300
Ah, the management team is working here,

62
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,130
in front of CEO's table, feel free to enjoy?

63
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,980
Feel free to!

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,190
Are you messing with us, this is non-sense!

65
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,110
Don't you think I've outdone myself with the tight budget I had to work with?

66
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,570
Yes, I do. You did good.

67
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,910
What is it?

68
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,500
What's that?

69
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,050
They are here to monitor us?

70
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:05,460
CEO's room, as well as the management department, and employees' beneficial facility

71
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,590
This is?

72
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,180
But can we do something about this wall?

73
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,960
It's so empty.

74
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,300
I feel like I'm working in the storage.

75
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,140
The outside looks good.

76
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,580
It's because of the budget, please understand.

77
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,970
CEO, this is ridiculous.

78
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,990
Think about the image of Gaming company.

79
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,030
Internal is more important, you gotta give up the exterior.

80
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,430
CEO, I'm the team lead for the design team.

81
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,110
You can't say that to someone who's in charge of exterior.

82
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,610
When you work, you can look at the monitor only.

83
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,780
Out of sight, out of mind.

84
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,960
Gosh, I can't take this.

85
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,410
Please purchase 10 cans of paint. We'll take care of it.

86
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,180
As the design team leader,

87
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,880
I can't accept having to work in a building where there's no sense of beauty.

88
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,660
Why don't you work during that time?

89
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,680
We won't let it interfere with our work.

90
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,410
We'll do it from time to time. So don't worry.

91
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,580
All right. Then I'll approve only five cans.

92
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,200
Fine, do that.

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,210
I'll purchase the rest with my own money.

94
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,260
I'm so sorry. I was going to watch your show last night...

95
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,790
Geez, forget it, man.

96
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,760
There's no need for us to stare at each other.

97
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,280
No one showed up?

98
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,900
Not even one?

99
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,210
There were some people who clicked wrong.

100
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,840
One or two.

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,400
They left after about 10 seconds or so.

102
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,770
You should've hung onto them, so they won't leave.

103
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,080
Oh, the Crazy One.

104
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,830
Crazy One?

105
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,750
You drink it.

106
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,970
I said you're dead if we run into each other again.

107
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,060
How will you do that?

108
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,870
Where are you going?

109
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,940
Please tell me how you're going to kill me before you go.

110
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,280
Don't follow me.

111
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,790
"Don't follow me."

112
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,700
Hey. What are you doing?

113
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,440
Give it.

114
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,100
You don't like 7-Up?

115
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,760
I was trying to make up.

116
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,840
All right, all right. I'll groom you.

117
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,620
You'll gain at least 500 audiences if you do the show with me.

118
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,150
Crazy One, is this fun for you?

119
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,020
You mean life?

120
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,430
Should we have a deep discussion sitting here?

121
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,870
Here. Hop on.

122
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,080
I don't know what you ate wrong.

123
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,410
Stop bothering me and go away!

124
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,670
Geez.

125
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,520
Hey, I don't smell anything.

126
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,350
My ex-boyfriend said even my fart smells like perfume.

127
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,140
But you know... you're enjoying me following you around, huh?

128
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,320
Aren't you happy to receive attention like this?

129
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,790
I know it, too. Attention seekers recognize each other.

130
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,900
You want me to continue to follow you around, huh?

131
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,840
Right. Who can stop a crazy person from thinking that?

132
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,400
You have no idea where you're going right now and you're just circling the field.

133
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
Isn't that asking for me to follow you around?

134
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,730
When my head is all mixed up, I just like to walk.

135
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,310
Why are you all mixed up in your head?

136
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,500
Is it the money I took from you?

137
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,940
I'll give back the 3 million won. Tell me your account number.

138
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,500
I won't fall for it again. Stop the bulls***.

139
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,170
Wow, you're quick.

140
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,540
I think I can get 6 million won out of you if I keep provoking.

141
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,420
Hey! You're really dead. I'm not kidding you.

142
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,630
Okay, okay, let's work harder.

143
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,320
I'll push for 6 million won!

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,730
You really want to die, huh?

145
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,960
Hey, this is how you make money.

146
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,980
You said you want to make money, didn't you?

147
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:30,860
Just be aggro like me. Whether you kill me or not, that's not important to me.

148
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,220
I just need the attention. I succeeded then.

149
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,170
Do you understand?

150
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,460
So what am I supposed to do?

151
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,550
Tell it to me straight if you're going to teach me! Hey!

152
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,010
Hey, Crazy One!

153
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,150
The Crazy One and the Lunatic combo...

154
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,110
It's a killer.

155
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,700
Right. That's definitely a watchtower.

156
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,670
Right? For some reason, I feel the stare in the back of my neck.

157
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,780
The budget... It's all done.

158
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,500
The cost of the paint and labor. It's all in here.

159
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,780
Then the interior walls. You didn't do it intentionally? That's not much of a savings.

160
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,030
- Move forward with the budget.
- What?

161
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,530
To spend money on amateur vendors when we have professionals. That's also a waste.

162
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:59,800
- What are you saying?
- Approve the cost of 10 cans of paint and use the labor cost as a bonus to the designers.

163
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,900
Use the same budget to utilize professionals and get all the credit.

164
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,780
It's not about taking the credit. It's a win-win situation.

165
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,480
Win-win? You're the only one who wins all the time.

166
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,070
CEO, where is the conference room? We have a shareholders meeting coming up.

167
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,460
Would they come all the way here? It's such a bother.

168
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,360
- But you never know. Shouldn't we still set it up?/- We can.

169
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,920
The conference room. Over there.

170
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,340
That ping pong table? How is that a conference room?

171
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,410
Mr. Song, you're right. It's a conference room.

172
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,090
Ping pong table (sounds like "grand conference room") conference room.

173
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,470
Ping pong table conference room?

174
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,370
Whoa. Daebak.

175
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,410
Unless they're part of the management team, there aren't any shareholders who'd come all the way here. Just do it here.

176
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,090
Our headquarter location is perfect!

177
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,020
We can get things done in a speedy manner.

178
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,310
What the heck?

179
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,770
Why is this here?

180
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,810
It's quite malicious.

181
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,330
What's going on?

182
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,360
Take a look here.

183
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,310
Someone posted the Joybuster 
proposal on the game community site.

184
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,910
Do all the titles say, "Examples of game proposal failures?"

185
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,600
I think they intentionally spread it online 
to prevent from anyone using a portion of it.

186
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,350
Can you trace it?

187
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,680
It's a one-time use username and the IP is overseas. It'd be tough.

188
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,600
Seeing how there's no hacking record from the outside, I think it's done by the Taesan insider.

189
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,430
Materials that Taesan stole?

190
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,710
Anyone you're suspicious of?

191
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,260
Half of the company quit. It's not like we can be suspicious of everyone.

192
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,450
First, look for ways to strengthen the security for the planning team internal system.

193
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,330
Will do.

194
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,590
- Bye.
- Good work.

195
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,490
- Sunbaenim, can I have a ride home?/- No, I don't want to.

196
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,540
- Please?
- Okay.

197
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,720
- Newbie.
- Yes.

198
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,640
How about some chicken?

199
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,280
I should take a break tonight. I don't feel too good.

200
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,190
What's with you? Being this weak when you're about to eat chicken?

201
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,420
- I'm really not feeling well. I'm sorry. Goodnight.
- Hey.

202
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,900
Hey, hey! Hey, Newbie!

203
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,180
Forget it then.

205
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,830
Thank you. But I don't drink sweet drinks.

206
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,030
Me, too.

207
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,240
What in the world?

208
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,260
It's not sweet at all.

209
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,440
Tastes nutty.

210
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,050
What is this?

211
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,020
What's going on?

212
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,050
A rat, rat, rat!

213
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,880
A rat?

214
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,550
Do something.

215
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,510
How can I catch it?

216
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,270
Aren't you capable of doing anything?

217
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:01,510
Epidemic hemorrhagic fever, salmonella, leptospirosis, Black Plague, etc.

218
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,040
They all come from rats. I can't kill it.

219
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,100
What do we do then?

220
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,930
I'll call the pest control tomorrow. Let's leave for now.

221
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,560
Aren't you going home?

222
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,600
I will.

223
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,900
You go ahead.

224
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,320
I'll go in a moment.

225
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,260
You're really a scaredy-cat. I never thought you'd be like that.

226
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,860
I know that you'd be seeing me from a negative perspective.

227
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,160
At least, you know.

228
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,940
I'm asking just in case. When we drank together last time,

229
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,910
did I make a mistake with you that I can't recall?

230
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,700
Getting drunk would do that to you.

231
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,140
So I did make a mistake, that means.

232
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,240
I won't make an issue out of that. So don't worry.

233
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,300
I saw a saying in a bar overseas that say, "Alcohol doesn't make you a bad person.

234
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,880
It reveals the bad person in you."

235
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,000
Are you afraid you're a bad person?

236
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,140
I'm just concerned.

237
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,890
I'm sure I didn't mean to do what I did.

238
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,320
But if that means I revealed my true self,

239
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,760
that'd be a problem.

240
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,610
You're so sensitive. AAA type.

241
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,740
How did such a sensitive person decide to sell Pigwar?

242
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,860
I don't get it.

243
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,420
How did you know about me selling Pigwar?

244
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,270
What do you mean how do I know that? Don't you remember?

245
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,870
- Did I tell you?
- Are you still drunk?

246
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,230
Gosh, I got the chills.

247
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,500
I'm perfectly fine. Clear minded.

248
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm asking you when did we talk about Pigwar?

249
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,700
What do you mean when? You told me everything in front of your house that night.

250
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,870
Who the heck are you?

251
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,460
Oh, telling you then. I thought you were talking about sucking your thumb.

252
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,790
Wait, wait...

253
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:40,680
You mean you didn't apologize that night because of Pigwar?

254
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,220
I have no reason to apologize over Pigwar. It was a management decision made by the decision-maker.

255
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,540
The sales cost is nothing compared to the new project we'll develop...

258
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,070
Mr. Park.

259
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:24,110
No matter how angry you are, how can you crack CEO's head?

260
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm sorry. I lost my temper.

261
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,490
It's late. I'll stay with him. You go home.

262
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,410
No, I'll stay.

263
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,810
Both of you, go home.

264
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,050
Oh? You're awake?

265
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,130
I'll leave after I sleep for a bit. You guys, go home.

266
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,920
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

267
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,200
You can say you meant it. You took out your anger on me. We're even now.

268
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,270
CEO...

269
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:02,590
Yeon Hwa, he's fine since he's talking just fine.

270
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,740
Let's go.

271
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,800
It's okay. Let's go. Your bag.

272
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,690
It's okay.

273
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,150
You're the fastest one to react, Yeon Hwa.

274
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,930
I was wondering what would happen in the morning at the office.

275
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,590
What's going on tomorrow?

276
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,440
Huh? Didn't you do that after checking his email?

277
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,100
What email?

278
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,840
CEO sent a companywide email after work.

279
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,860
The reason he sold Pigwar. He revealed his position on the matter.

280
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,280
<i>When the company is gone, Pigwar is gone, too.</i>

281
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,360
<i>Instead of our future that is in dire straits, we should survive</i>

282
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,800
<i>and make a history of our own.</i>

283
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,180
<i>In our developing future, I won't have to make such a decision as I was forced to make.</i>

284
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:16,080
<i>I believe in your ability to develop the next generation and further and better Pigwar.</i>

285
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,030
<i>Dear Joybuster employees...</i>

286
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,830
I didn't know.

287
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,900
Well, he was sharing his thoughts with us.

288
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,090
It's one of the two.

289
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,490
Either you empathized with the manager's feelings

290
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:42,550
or you said, "That's what you think!" and cracked his head.

291
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,410
It's not like that.

292
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,440
All right, I got it.

293
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,950
Should I drop you off there?

294
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,190
Yes.

295
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,760
Thank you for the ride. Go home safe.

296
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,160
Okay.

297
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,770
Yeon Hwa...

298
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:25,340
He loves his company more than you think.

299
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,230
So don't see him in such a negative light.

300
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,720
Okay.

301
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,740

Newbie, you're here early.

309
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,080
CEO, what happened to your head? Did you get hurt?

310
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,200
- A rat bit me.
- A rat?

311
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:55,640
Good job. Makes me feel great.

312
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,690
Take your time and drink this as you work. Pear drinks are great for cooling off.

313
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,860
Wait, wait, that's not how it is...

314
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,700
Ms. Shin.

315
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,730
- I didn't...
- Team Leader!

316
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,690
This is crazy.

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,660
- You're a hero.
- Don't say that.

318
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,510
After reading the CEO's email last night, I hoped someone would hit him over the head.

319
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,880
I look up to you for hitting him over the head first.

320
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,140
Right? Right?

321
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,500
- I feel great.
- Fine. I'm glad you feel that way.

322
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,420
If he does that again next time, I'll break his legs. Happy?

323
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,630
But honestly, I do understand CEO.

324
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,580
It's not like he had room to make another choice.

325
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,520
That's why I hoped someone would hit him just once.

326
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,830
I see.

327
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,350

I already did. 10 copies.

That many? We won't have that many people.

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,870

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,070
Why is it here? Oh, this is...

336
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,230
It's not mounted. Let's move it, so we can move the car.

337
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,860
Okay.

338
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,240
What the heck? There's a person in here. I'm coming out.

339
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,200
- You should knock or something.
- What the?

340
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,590
I fell asleep.

Why are you here?

347
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,990
What do you mean why? I got an invite.

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,250
I was going to come down on Monday, but thought I'd be late. So I came early.

349
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,700
Wow, nice scenery. It's perfect for camping.

350
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,220
By chance, did you send over abalone?

351
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,210
Did you enjoy them?

352
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,570
A friend of mine runs a sashimi place in Noryangjin. He gave me a deal.

353
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,890
Wasn't it fresh?

354
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,710
Move your tent. This is a parking lot.

355
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,380
I'm sorry. It was tough to set it up.

356
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,060
- Help me.
- Careful.

357
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,390
That sounds great.

358
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,290
Oh? Wait!

359
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,860
- CEO!
- Yeon Hwa!

360
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,730
- Hello.
- Wow.

361
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,310
It's great to see you guys like this.

362
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,110
Why did you lose so much weight?

363
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,340
How have you been?

364
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,060
Just taking a break, you know.

365
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,760
- Newbie, aren't we going?
- Coming.

366
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,670
- Do you want something to drink?
- What?

367
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,340
- Iced Americano for me.
- Iced carmel macchiato.

368
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,440
Geez, he's so mean.

369
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,270
What can you do? Geez, I had no idea he'd be like that.

370
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,230
But you know...

371
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,510
- Curious about who he is?
- Yes.

372
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,580
It's Jo Tae Goo. He was the former CEO of Joybuster.

373
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,120
- Former CEO?
- We fired him.

374
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,020
But why would be come here?

375
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,130
He sold off all his shares and kept only one share. Only one.

376
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:15,320
But the problem is he has the right to attend the shareholders meeting with that one share.

377
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,600
Seeing the way he is, I think he came to ruin the shareholders meeting.

378
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,320
I wondered why it was so easy to get rid of him.

379
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,790
- Have some.
- Here you go.

380
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,950
Thank you!

381
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,410
Oh, Soo Jung.

382
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,420
- Soo Jung.
- Yes?

383
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,740
Did you have your baby's first birthday party?

384
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,980
- Yes, we did.
- Aigoo...

385
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,880
Why didn't you invite me? I'm sad.

386
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,090
How can I? It was the day after you got fired.

387
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,540
I would've still gone crying.

388
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,430
Thank you.

389
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,970
I'm ashamed of coming here like this.

390
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,260
I feel so bad toward you all.

391
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,150
Oh, no. Don't say that. There's no other CEO like you.

392
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,930
We feel bad for staying behind.

393
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,560
It would've worked out if we held out a little longer.

394
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,500
I had no power.

395
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,010
You need more strength. Eat meat. It's burning.

396
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,120
- You guys eat.<br> <i>- Okay!</i>

397
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,340
I'll just starve tomorrow.

398
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,070
What in the world?

399
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,050
Are you telling us to eat or not?

400
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,280
Eat watchfully.

401
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,470
Okay.

402
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,300
<i>Bottoms up!</i>

403
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,610
<i>Cheers!</i>

404
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,770
<i>Bottoms up!</i>

405
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,410
<i>Joybuster</i>

406
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,880
I should still look the part.

407
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,790
<i>5/30/2019, Regular Shareholders Meeting</i>

408
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,610
Here is our performance report.

409
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,670
One, two, three. One, two, three.

410
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,670
One, two, three. Okay.

411
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,260
Why is your office so far away?

412
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,400
And what's with the stairs?

413
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,610
Chairman, hello.

414
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,950
How can the major shareholder miss the meeting?

415
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,430
Hello, Chairman.

416
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,470
CEO Jo, it's good to see you!

417
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,680
Hello.

418
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,880
Why are you standing? Sit down.

419
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,970
Thank you for attending our meeting even though it's so far away.

420
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,070
All right, we'll begin...

421
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,320
Just a moment. There are more shareholders on their way.

422
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,290
They'll arrive soon. Let's wait for them before we begin.

423
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,840
Ah, okay. Sure.

424
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,000
Then we'll give a few more minutes...

425
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,540
The rules are rules.

426
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,920
Begin on time.

427
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,970
Okay. Then, to follow the rules...

428
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,330
we'll begin the meeting with those who are present.

429
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,250
The shareholders are here.

430
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,710
<i>Joybuster</i>

431
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,160
Hello.

432
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,510
Hello.

433
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:51,260
- This way, please.
- Let's go.

434
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,260
Who are all those people?

435
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,700
Our company shareholders.

436
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,500
An innovative IT company shareholders are all old fogies?

437
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,530
Shareholder meeting thugs.

438
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,300
Shareholder meeting thugs?

439
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,590
One share or 10 shares at the most.

440
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,460
They purchase a bare minimum amount of shares to attend the meeting.

441
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,620
They disrupt the regular process of the meeting. Professional meeting disruptors.

442
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,750
They came determined.

443
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,240
It's going to get noisy.

444
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,620
Why did you hide your office out in the boonies?

445
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,120
Are you serving water only?

446
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,470
The way you serve your shareholders sucks.

447
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,070
The 2019...

448
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,930
Joybuster shareholders meeting is convened.

449
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,080
We'll pay respects to our country.

450
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,910
Please stand and face the flag.

451
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,420
At ease.

452
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,040
We'll skip singing the anthem due to time constraints.

453
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,810
I object. We have plenty of time. Let's sing the anthem.

454
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,080
As part of the game industry that contributes heavily to the national economics,

455
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,420
we have a duty to sing our national anthem with our own voices.

456
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,100
I agree!

457
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,660
Of course! We shouldn't skip the anthem as Koreans.

458
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,940
We're a huge contributor to the nation's industry. Sing all four verses.

459
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:46,780
What kind of nonsensical company runs a shareholders meeting like this from the get-go?

460
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,070
All right, all right. Let's do it!

461
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,340
We should keep the formality.

462
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,850
Okay.

463
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,800
Then we'll sing the anthem.

464
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,930
♪ Hibiscus and the vast land ♪

465
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:10,460
♪ Beautiful land of ours ♪

466
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:17,300
♪ Koreans in Korea ♪

467

♪ Long live Korea ♪

468
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,080
I'll conduct a roll call.

469
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,720
Based on the procedure of the meeting, we have a special agenda in place.

470
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,300
From the total shares of 11,256,210,

471
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,340
we have the majority which is 5,610,007 shares in attendance.

472
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:50,020
I declare this meeting is convened properly.

473
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,840
As for settlement of accounts report, please refer to the report we passed out to you.

474
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,210
We'll move onto the business strategic plan report.

475
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,620
For the growth of Joybuster,

476
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,500
thank you for coming all this way to

477
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,000
all of you, shareholders.

478
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:21,460
For mass revenue structural reorganization, we canceled the contract with the former publisher

479
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,910
in order to develop Joybuster's independent service platform.

480
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,270
This is an important proposal

481
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,310
and it's a decision we can't afford to postpone.

482
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,840
I have a question.

483
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,010
To establish independent service without a publisher, you need a huge amount of financial support.

484
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,380
Please tell us how you'll acquire the funds.

485
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,570
That's right! Tell us straight!

486
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,300
How would you acquire the funds?

487
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,650
Be straight with us!

488
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,840
With what money?

489
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,780
You're such a fraud! If you'll do it this way, forget about it!

490
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,030
Shareholders.

491
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,840
Please restrain from creating commotion for the smooth progress of the meeting.

492
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,840
How can I yell right now, huh?

493
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,470
Who the hell are you? How dare you shut us up?

494
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:07,310
That's right! You think you own the company? Aren't we the owners?

495
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,220
I'll address you all.

496
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,610
With the balance profit from the business and from the sales of the Pigwar IP,

497
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,990
we can obtain the funds.

498
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:21,810
Wait. Stop. Did you just say you're selling Pigwar IP?

499
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,300
I already did.

500
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,280
I canceled the contract by handing over the IP (Intellectual Property) to the publisher

501
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,140
and I obtained funds to develop new projects and an independent publisher.

502
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,630
That was a way to gain both independence and support.

503
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,200
Stop lying.

504
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,400
If you sell off the Pigwar IP, you don't have any game to service.

505
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,030
How will you raise revenue after you've run out of money?

506
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,810
We're developing a new game.

507
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,030
You don't own the Pigwar license.

508
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:52,240
Do you mean you'll repurchase the license and make Season 2?

509
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,500
Is that your plan?

510
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,910
We also shut down Season 2 of Pigwar that we were developing.

511
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,270
We're currently developing new IP project.

512
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,240
What did you say?

513
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,240
Doesn't this sound too familiar?

514
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,360
In the end, you'll take the money what's left of the business. You pull all funds pretending to develop new projects.

515
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,750
That sounds like you'll take the money and run.

516
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,210
That will never happen.

517
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,680
We're currently in development for the new game.

518
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,510
I can guarantee an effective increase in revenue once we release internationally.

519
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,520
You'll give up on stable income

520
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,930
and you'll risk it all on a dangerous bet. What is that new project anyway?

521
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,510
I can't tell you that.

522
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,460
It's connected to the management strategy. It's confidential.

523
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,220
Confidential? You don't have to keep it a secret from us shareholders.

524
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,670
Not long ago, we had an incident where our proposal was leaked.

525
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,410
Since then, we decided to have only the strategic planning team to share the proposals.

526
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,700
That is our policy.

527
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:54,090
You expect me to believe that? Are you sure you have a plan?

528
00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:00,110
I apologize, but the only thing I can reveal to you is that we're currently developing new projects.

529
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,910
<i>Let's be honest here, CEO Ahn!</i>

530
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,970
It's only been a month since you started. You're telling me you're developing a new game that will turn the table?

531
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,540
You think that makes sense?

532
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,580
We're currently developing.

533
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,500
So, you should explain to us properly what you're currently developing!

534
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,400
I've never seen CEO Jo so angry like that.

535
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,420
It's understandable.

536
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,070
He was told that his baby Pigwar was fold off and we're holding someone else's baby.

537
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:33,130
But no matter how angry he gets, the agenda will pass regardless.

538
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,790
I just feel sorry for him.

539
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:41,860
No. CEO Jo already knows that he can't stop it.

540
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,990
That's not why he's getting so angry like that right now.

541
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,800
Then what?

542
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,270
They keep a record of the meeting in the minutes.

543
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:56,230
They have an obligation to record everything and share with everyone.

544
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,710
He wants to make the issue public.

545
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,720
Public? What's next then?

546
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,670
If you don't have any plans for the next product,

547
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,680
I charge CEO Ahn Dan Te with malicious and risky business management,

548
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,360
the outflow of funds by selling IP, and breach of duty.

549
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,870
We got sucked into this.

550
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,670
Delete it from the record.

551
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,370
Don't miss a word.

552
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,770
Yes.

553
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,780
Look, look, take it away and look.

554
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,450
Let's see if you recorded everything.

555
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,470
Aren't you an employee here?

556
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,220
I'm a new recruit.

557
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,010
You should have a professional transcriptionist.

558
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,190
You're in it together playing games with us?

559
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,790
Look at this terrible company. From the get-go,

560
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,360
how dare you try to mock the shareholders?

561
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,530
08A1907725.

562
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,570
Take it out.

563
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,300
Yes, sir.

564
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,660
For transparency in our records,

565
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,320
We hired a newbie who has

566
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,460
a national certification for transcription.

567
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,280
Everything is being recorded. So please don't worry.

568
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,220
<i>Certification</i>

569
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,460
<i>Application</i>

570
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,450
<i>Certification: Transcriptionist</i>

571
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,800
Are you sure it's legit?

572
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,770
We'll check everything in the end.

573
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:37,270
There's no point. How much longer do you think your lies will last?

574
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,110
You should know this, too.

575
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,960
What I say is also being recorded in the minutes.

576
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,390
CEO Jo Tae Goo, you were fired from Joybuster, right?

577
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,020
You want to damage my reputation?

578
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,720
Did you get fired for lying all the time?

579
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,980
I don't lie.

580
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,710
Then what is your standard for lying?

581
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,700
You don't know?

582
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,810
If you can't keep a promise, does that make it a lie?

583
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:05,200
A company always announces its plans for the future.

584
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,220
It just hasn't come to fruition yet.

585
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,820
You're saying you only laid out the plan?

586
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,890
Is it any different if I do it?

587
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:16,490
Did you manage to keep your plans well to drive it to the ground?

588
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,130
You can't take me down with you like that.

589
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,470
I am trying to get you to stand with me. But I'm not saying we should both go down.

590
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:29,310
I'm saying this because I believe you didn't intend to lie either.

591
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:33,850
A company's plan is a decision made for the company to survive.

592
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,720
This is the truth.

593
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,850
You asked what my standard for lying is, right?

594
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:45,080
It's simple. If none of the employees working here believe you, it means it's a lie.

595
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:06,700
Do you all believe CEO Ahn's words?

596
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,890
See?

597
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,580
You can't say a thing even if you're reported.

598
00:45:55,350 --> 00:46:00,520
I'll say an honest word about the new product development.

599
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,810
Fine. Come clean if you got caught.

600
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:09,510
Shutting down the project, selling Pigwar, and the opposition from the shareholders for canceling the publisher.

601
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,900
I expected all that.

602
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,710
Of course, I considered the fact that you'll doubt the validity of the new product.

603
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:19,420
However, what's important to us is a platform for us to jump off of.

604
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,370
We'll work on that platform first...

605
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:25,740
Don't bother with all the spiel. Cut to the chase.

606
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,630
I thought you liked that.

607
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,020
Do you have a new product in mind or not?

608
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,170
Do you or don't you?

609
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,810
Currently...

610
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,950
Don't drag this out and just tell them.

611
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,970
It's so frustrating. What are you doing?

612
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:03,170
I'm Shin Yeon Hwa, Planning Team Leader.

613
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,460
Stay out of it.

614
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,870
Since developing new product is my job, I can speak to you myself, right?

615
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,100
Sure. You go ahead.

616
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,080
Please step aside.

617
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,840
That's right. The person in charge wants to reveal it herself.

618
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,640
CEO Ahn, step aside if you don't have anything to say.

619
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,890
That's right. Move. Step aside.

620
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,160
Take his mic away.

621
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,880
Okay, Yeon Hwa. Speak.

622
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,770
Do you or don't you?

623
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,400
We don't.

624
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,600
That's right.

625
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,440
There's no way you have it.

626
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,480
To come up with new product funds, he sold off Pigwar.

627
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:05,270
I had to stand back and watch since I'm just an employee. But I can't stand back any longer.

628
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,180
I'll tell you everything.

629
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,800
Good job!

630
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,830
Okay. Tell us everything now.

631
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:15,470
We have nothing here.

632
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:19,840
It's just an empty office.

633
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,800
So, it makes me think every morning when I come to work.

634
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,730
It must be difficult for you.

635
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:31,260
This is so fun.

636
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,830
Fun?

637
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,730
You're pissed off at the company and want to throw thinner (sounds like fun) at it, right?

638
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:45,880
The excitement of filling out the blanks one day at a time. Don't you know?

639
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,170
It sure is fun. Just like this storage walls.

640
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,760
Should I tell you about our new project? Nothing.

641
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,120
Of course, it's just not in a physical form yet.

642
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:05,580
But in the planning team's brain, including mine, it's already completed.

643
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,910
Bring me the proposal.

644
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:11,780
He already said it's confidential and we're working on it.

645
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,760
CEO Jo, aren't you aware of the importance of security more than anyone else?

646
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,600
Yeon Hwa, what are you doing?

647
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,010
Two years ago, a competitor of ours

648
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,960
released a similar item and we took the loss.

649
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,850
You had to give up on the development balance we were owed and shut it down.

650
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:40,340
Why? Objectively speaking, their game was upgraded better than ours.

651
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,390
In conclusion, I took all the responsibility and stepped down.

652
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,340
So CEO Ahn should also...

653
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,700
I'm not talking about your fault.

654
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,410
We just don't want to repeat the same mistake.

655
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,400
If you're trying to get past this by saying it's confidential...

656
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,800
No, if we pass this agenda and close the meeting,

657
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:03,030
I'll brief you on the new product separately without having to worry about the minutes.

658
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,100
What do you think?

659
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:16,330
You're on his team now.

660
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,180
We're on the same team.

661
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,470
Yeon Hwa.

662
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:26,510
Joybuster was always on the same team.

663
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:31,330
You too, CEO Jo, and also shareholders.

664
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,940
We're all on the same team, aren't we?

665
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,960
No, you can't.

666
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,750
What Ms. Shin is suggesting isn't what the company desires.

667
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,500
We can share the info with no one else except for the development team.

668
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,960
CEO!

669
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,860
We even had a proposal leak the other day. How can we trust him?

670
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,500
How can we? We've known him longer than you.

671
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,040
Much longer and much closer.

672
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,830
CEO Jo Tae Goo will never...

673
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:09,350
make the wrong decision.

674
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,270
Fine.

675
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:33,600
CEO Jo, would you like to hear our report before you leave?

676
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:42,200
CEO, we're busy people, too.

677
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,220
That's right, CEO Jo. Decide what you'll do.

678
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,890
Turn over the table with these kids and wake them up!

679
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,980
I'll pass this agenda.

680
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:25,930
Chairman, sir.

681
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:28,040
Do you agree to pass?

682
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,060
I agree.

683
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,170
- Agreed!
- Agreed!

684
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,110
- Agreed!
- Agreed!

685
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,130
Agreed.

686
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:42,020
The agenda has passed with a unanimous vote from the shareholders present.

687
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:49,040
The 2019 Joybuster Regular Shareholders Meeting is adjourned.

688
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,700
It's a new innovative product that emphasizes camaraderie among the users.

689
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:25,860
We've pulled all the technical and design capabilities that developed and managed Pigwar.

690
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,160
It will be a relentless project.

691
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,260
That's all.

692
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,200
It's not our style.

693
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,170
That approach is intentional.

694
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:44,740
I hope the users also feel that it's different from the usual Joybuster style.

695
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,190
What's Joybuster's branding identity?

696
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,730
"Bringing happiness to the world."

697
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:56,140
It may be different from the style of the games we've produced thus far. But it doesn't mean we've changed.

698
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,560
Another words, our branding identity hasn't changed.

699
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,360
Whose idea is this?

700
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:16,440
Joybuster's idea.

701
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,230
Why didn't you work like this when I was here?

702
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,420
This is great!

703
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,950
Great! Great! Great!

704
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,470
Great!

705
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:41,150
Push this forward just like this.

706
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:45,320
If there's any shareholder who interferes with this, I'll roll up my sleeves

707
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,170
and convince them by showing up at their house.

708
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:49,720
Got it?

709
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,480
Great. That's it!

710
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,240
Great, great, great!

711
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,520
Great, great!

712
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,000
CEO.

713
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,170
Good job. You're good at your job!

714
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,610
You should've been a team leader sooner.

715
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,430
I'm sorry about earlier.

716
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,330
Were you sad because I didn't side with you?

717
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,420
No way.

718
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,230
I feel bad.

719
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,770
What's your real reason for coming here?

720
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:41,770
I got nothing to do at home.

721
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,810
You weren't dreaming of conquering?

722
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,940
Could be.

723
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:54,500
Selling the company at such a low price. Did you anticipate this situation?

724
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,960
I can't see the future that well.

725
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:03,800
I understand that NexViper showed greater interest with a better offer.

726
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,050
I wanted to know what your real reason is for handing over the company to us.

727
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,400
I was so angry.

728
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:18,170
Somehow, we became their subcontractor.

729
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:21,900
And the company faltered because we didn't follow their order.

730
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:26,240
That's not why I had started this company.

731
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,050
I started it to make the game I, I mean, we wanted to make.

732
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:37,870
I completely understand how you feel.

733
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,890
CEO Ahn.

734
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,060
I don't care what kind of position it is.

735
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,260
Can I continue to work here?

736
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:02,390
Prohibited to work in the same market within three years. Did you forget the contract?

737
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,900
I want to make games.

738
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,930
You're at fault for the past failed management.

739
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,930
You should stop working with games.

740
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,580
But instead, I'll ask you for a favor.

741
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,420
A favor?

742
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:22,410
You may have failed the company, but you've come all this way focused on games only all your life.

743
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,960
I don't think you're a failure at that.

744
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,630
At the least, I can tell that by looking at the employees who protect and follow you.

745
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,580
CEO Ahn.

746
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:36,610
If I lack anything, as a life sunbae who has lived in the world of games,

747
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:42,030
I ask for your uncensored advice and criticisms.

748
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,090
I ask of you.

749
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,210
Is it too much?

750
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,860
Yes.

751
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,980
Last time when you came by the monastery, I didn't tell you why I hired you, huh?

752
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,560
You said you just hired me trying to be cool.

753
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:25,640
I thought you'd fight well in my place.

754
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,510
For Joybuster. Just like today.

755
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,280
CEO...

756
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:39,470
She's fighting very well with me thanks to you who hired her.

757
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:42,200
Do I fight for no reason?

758
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,100
You make up reasons to fight.

759
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,530
See? How can I not get upset?

760
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,020
Just think he's expressing his interest in you.

761
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:55,050
Celebrities say malicious comments are better than no comments.

762
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,270
You two have great chemistry.

763
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,160
CEO!

764
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,800
Am I overdoing it here?

765
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,410
Yes.

766
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,360
Goodbye, CEO!

767
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,860
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

768
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,110
What's wrong with this?

769
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,000
What's with the warning all of a sudden?

770
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,900
Just you, Soo Jung?

771
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,400
Yes, it's acting weird!

772
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,210
I'm ruined.

773
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,430
I typed everything up.

774
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:49,590
Wait. Don't tough anything, everyone.

00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,860
