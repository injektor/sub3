<font color="yellow">Da Hae is exceptionally kind towards you.</font>

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,380

35
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,680

36

37
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,680

<font color="yellow">I believe...</font>

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,720
<font color="yellow">you're behind all of that.</font>

40
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,180
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that out of concern as an advisor?</font>

41
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,850
<font color="yellow">Or are you saying that as her father?</font>

42
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,580
<font color="yellow">Did you know that?</font>

43
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,520
<font color="yellow">It is an open secret.</font>

44
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,820
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows that but pretends not to know.</font>

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,380
<font color="yellow">Stop having any influence on Da Hae.</font>

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,420
<font color="yellow">Make sure to keep your distance from her.</font>

47
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,920
<font color="yellow">I can't do that if you are saying that as an advisor.</font>

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,380
<font color="yellow">Da Hae has a talent to run Goongnakwon.</font>

49
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,010
<font color="yellow">I will stay close to her and help her out.</font>

50
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,120
<font color="yellow">If you're saying it as a father, I still can't do that.</font>

51
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,950
<font color="yellow">You have no right to say that.</font>

52

<font color="yellow">Do as I say.</font>

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,480

56

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,150
<font color="yellow">I will give you three days to do so.</font>

58
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,450

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,390

<font color="yellow">you're not mistaken.</font>

65
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,150
<font color="yellow">Since I won the position, I should take my trophy.</font>

66
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,150
<font color="yellow">And you are my trophy.</font>

67
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,680
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to take back your father's name.</font>

68
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,150
<font color="yellow">I have a name to take back as well.</font>

69
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,320
<font color="yellow">Once I take it back,</font>

70
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,390
<font color="yellow">things will become more interesting.</font>

71
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,850
<font color="yellow">I don't need any trophies.</font>

72
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,220
<font color="yellow">I will just smash everything.</font>

73
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,390
<font color="yellow">I will give you three days.</font>

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,050
<font color="yellow">Vacate the office completely.</font>

75
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,580

79

100
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,550
<font color="yellow">that Mr Ha ordered my father to kill?</font>

101

<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

102
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,580
<font color="yellow">He probably didn't say it out loud.</font>

103
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,520
<font color="yellow">But he did give your father drugs and a knife.</font>

104
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,650

<font color="yellow">Mind your own business.</font>

163
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,120
<font color="yellow">I can take care of myself.</font>

165

<font color="yellow">That's what Yeo Kyung said.</font>

166
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,450
<font color="yellow">Go and see her.</font>

<font color="yellow">they were just trying to kidnap you.</font>

<font color="yellow">If I'd known you were so pretty,</font>

207
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,580
<font color="yellow">I'd have come in for questioning.</font>

208
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,880
<font color="yellow">I think we'll be meeting often anyway.</font>

209
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,250
<font color="yellow">Your aide wasn't enough to arrest Mr Ha.</font>

210
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,900
<font color="yellow">I think I need to take you down...</font>

211
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,080
<font color="yellow">to make the arrest.</font>

212
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,880
<font color="yellow">What in the world is she saying?</font>

213
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,650
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Ahn, translate for me.</font>

214
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,900
<font color="yellow">Are you deaf or what?</font>

<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

216
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,320
<font color="yellow">You can pick 1 of 2 options.</font>

217
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,870
<font color="yellow">You can go in for breaking tax laws...</font>

218
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,530
<font color="yellow">and pay a fine.</font>

219
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,010
<font color="yellow">It will be embarrassing,</font>

220
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,720
<font color="yellow">but you can stay in Congress.</font>

221
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,460
<font color="yellow">If you refuse to cooperate,</font>

222
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,430
<font color="yellow">as soon as the provisional session ends,</font>

223
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,190
<font color="yellow">I will have you detained.</font>

224
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,230
<font color="yellow">A minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5-year sentence.</font>

225
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,660
<font color="yellow">That's what you'll get.</font>

226
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,920
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so harsh?</font>

227
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,610
<font color="yellow">Are there any other options?</font>

228
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,720
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

229
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,380
<font color="yellow">I choose number one.</font>

230
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,520
<font color="yellow">Under one condition.</font>

231
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,680
<font color="yellow">I want you to give me Mr Ha.</font>

232
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,880
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you well.</font>

233
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,020
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

234
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

235
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,220
<font color="yellow">It's about Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung.</font>

236
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, I heard she came to work today.</font>

237
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,080
<font color="yellow">I need you...</font>

238
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,220
<font color="yellow">to put more pressure on her.</font>

239
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,350
<font color="yellow">She should be suspended or dismissed,</font>

240
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,220
<font color="yellow">but I think someone on the inside is helping her.</font>

241
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,980
<font color="yellow">Aren't you the one who caused the trouble?</font>

242
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,850
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me...</font>

243
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,980
<font color="yellow">to clean up your mess?</font>

244
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,080
<font color="yellow">You gave me a lot of money to put into the foundation.</font>

245
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,260
<font color="yellow">I gave you an extra amount of shares.</font>

246
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
<font color="yellow">Can't I even ask for a favour?</font>

247
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,320
<font color="yellow">Then do something in return.</font>

248
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,040
<font color="yellow">You have cash in your own safe.</font>

249
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,250
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

250
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,120
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

251
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,120
<font color="yellow">If I touch my clients' money,</font>

252
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,380
<font color="yellow">I die.</font>

253
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,450
<font color="yellow">You know that.</font>

254
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,070
<font color="yellow">That's why everyone wants this badge.</font>

255
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,350
<font color="yellow">Once you have this,</font>

256
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,720
<font color="yellow">it's no longer embezzlement.</font>

257
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,190
<font color="yellow">It becomes an investment.</font>

258
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,320
<font color="yellow">Leave for now.</font>

259
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,280
<font color="yellow">We'll talk again.</font>

260
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,320
<font color="yellow">Must you suck the marrow out of my bones, too?</font>

261
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,850
<font color="yellow">People who crave meat just aren't full enough.</font>

262
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,220
<font color="yellow">You can finally say you're full when the marrow's gone.</font>

263
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,480
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

264
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,240
<font color="yellow">Get rid of this first.</font>

265
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,440
<font color="yellow">It's darkens the room.</font>

266
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,650
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

267
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,550
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

268
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,200
<font color="yellow">You're here just in time.</font>

269
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,010
<font color="yellow">The couch won't fit in the annex.</font>

270
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,950
<font color="yellow">No one's going to the annex.</font>

271
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,800
<font color="yellow">You gave me three days.</font>

272
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,320
<font color="yellow">I changed my mind.</font>

273
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,080
<font color="yellow">I wanted to get things over and done with.</font>

274
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,690
<font color="yellow">We're planning to get rid of the secret room.</font>

275
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,370
<font color="yellow">My gosh, you even fitted a rotating wall for a door.</font>

276
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,800
<font color="yellow">What was that for? You're so weird.</font>

277
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,450
<font color="yellow">Are you a spy or what?</font>

278
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,150
<font color="yellow">We'll suspend the company card you have.</font>

279
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,690
<font color="yellow">What else was there? That's right.</font>

280
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,550
<font color="yellow">I fired your henchmen.</font>

281
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,050
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look so nice to have...</font>

282
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,690
<font color="yellow">burly men in suits running around the place.</font>

283
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,080
<font color="yellow">And are you anticipating a terrorist attack or what?</font>

284
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,480
<font color="yellow">Why would you need a dozen security personnel?</font>

285
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,610
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

286
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,950
<font color="yellow">You really seem to be enjoying this.</font>

287
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,380
<font color="yellow">Can you tell?</font>

288
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,820
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I should try harder to hide my feelings.</font>

289
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,050
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I feel?</font>

290
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,980
<font color="yellow">I think I'm floating on cloud nine.</font>

291
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,070
<font color="yellow">It's thrilling, and I can't get enough of it.</font>

292
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,220
<font color="yellow">You better stay on that cloud nine.</font>

293
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,840
<font color="yellow">Because I'll drop you from it.</font>

294
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,940
<font color="yellow">My gosh, you're so scary.</font>

295
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,620
<font color="yellow">I'm so scared that I feel like crying.</font>

296
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,080
<font color="yellow">Watch out.</font>

297
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,690
<font color="yellow">He will stop at nothing to get back...</font>

298
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,690
<font color="yellow">what he lost.</font>

299
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,980
<font color="yellow">Gang Sook's a formidable woman.</font>

300
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,110
<font color="yellow">She wants me to sleep...</font>

301
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,620
<font color="yellow">where her father died.</font>

302
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,330
<font color="yellow">Does she want me to have nightmares?</font>

303
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,280
<font color="yellow">Shall I find you a place to stay outside?</font>

304
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,350
<font color="yellow">That's what my wife wants.</font>

305
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,520
<font color="yellow">If I leave now, I'll never be able to come back.</font>

306
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,360
<font color="yellow">- Mr Park.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

307
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,950
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's over for me?</font>

308
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,480
<font color="yellow">I can see you're cornered.</font>

309
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,750
<font color="yellow">That will soon change.</font>

310
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,630
<font color="yellow">I'll win the nomination and become a congressman.</font>

311
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,320
<font color="yellow">Then I'll get everything back.</font>

312
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,120

00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,900
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

471
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,840
<font color="yellow">But it takes a lot of time...</font>

472
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,350
<font color="yellow">to shoot a TV cooking programme.</font>

473
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,380
<font color="yellow">There are also a lot of variables to consider.</font>

474
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,280
<font color="yellow">Congressman So...</font>

475
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,050
<font color="yellow">Is he doing all right?</font>

476
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,590
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

477
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,920
<font color="yellow">Well, yes.</font>

478
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,020
<font color="yellow">He talks about you from time to time.</font>

479
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,590
<font color="yellow">Drop by Chimyeon Restaurant with him sometime.</font>

480
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,320
<font color="yellow">It would be nice...</font>

481
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,050
<font color="yellow">if Mr Ha could also join you both.</font>

482
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,450
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

483
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,450
<font color="yellow">I will give it a try.</font>

484
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,180
<font color="yellow">Since we're on it, we might as well make it very big.</font>

485
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,420
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha...</font>

486
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,980
<font color="yellow">should appear on the programme no matter what.</font>

487
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,850
<font color="yellow">And this is...</font>

488
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,850
<font color="yellow">not my plan.</font>

489
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,850
<font color="yellow">It's yours.</font>

490
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,850
<font color="yellow">Do you understand...</font>

491
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,090
<font color="yellow">what I mean?</font>

492
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,680
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

493
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,350
<font color="yellow">Just make sure to keep your end of the secret.</font>

494
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,980
<font color="yellow">Then I will work on it.</font>

495
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,680
<font color="yellow">Didn't he go crazy yet?</font>

496
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,220
<font color="yellow">It must be hard for him to stay sober.</font>

497
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,590
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha?</font>

498
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,750
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me about him?</font>

499
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,350
<font color="yellow">I thought you were his best friend nowadays.</font>

500
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,720
<font color="yellow">I heard you guys stick together like glue. Am I wrong?</font>

501
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,110
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

502
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,450
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to appoint Top Head of Noodles...</font>

503
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,450
<font color="yellow">as Master of Noodles.</font>

504
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,120
<font color="yellow">He only recently became the successor.</font>

505
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,370
<font color="yellow">We left...</font>

506
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,850
<font color="yellow">the head of noodles position open for three years.</font>

507
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,570
<font color="yellow">We should be more careful for Master of Noodles.</font>

508
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,520
<font color="yellow">If I leave that spot vacant,</font>

509
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,320
<font color="yellow">Jung Tae will watch for a chance to take it back.</font>

510
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,810
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that I'm trying to end things properly?</font>

511
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,350
<font color="yellow">Top Head of Noodles...</font>

512
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,410
<font color="yellow">can't become Master of Noodles.</font>

513
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,510
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

514
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,230
<font color="yellow">Are you jealous of me getting things my way?</font>

515
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,520
<font color="yellow">Top Head of Noodles...</font>

516
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,480
<font color="yellow">has taste blindness.</font>

517
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,620
<font color="yellow">He's lost his sense of taste.</font>

518
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,120
<font color="yellow">How can he become the master of noodles...</font>

519
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,290
<font color="yellow">when he can't even taste things properly?</font>

520
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,340

-  Are you sure?</font>

521
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,090
<font color="yellow">Why would I lie to you about something like this?</font>

522
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,090
<font color="yellow">If the Ko family finds out,</font>

523
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,120
<font color="yellow">it'll be hard for him to remain as the successor.</font>

524
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,320
<font color="yellow">So stop talking nonsense.</font>

525
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,260
<font color="yellow">Wow, he's like Batman.</font>

526
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,090
<font color="yellow">He is amazing.</font>

527
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,810
<font color="yellow">Don't you think?</font>

528
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,090
<font color="yellow">He cooks noodles so well...</font>

529
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,950
<font color="yellow">even without a sense of taste.</font>

530
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,970
<font color="yellow">He's like Batman, don't you think?</font>

531

<font color="yellow">If you don't,</font>

540
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,670
<font color="yellow">just memorise it.</font>

541
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,220
<font color="yellow">Put it in your head.</font>

542
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,940
<font color="yellow">Put that here.</font>

543
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,920
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Ma'am.
-  This way.</font>

544
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,910
<font color="yellow">Make sure not to scratch the floor.</font>

545
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,920

549

<font color="yellow">I took it back.</font>

550

551

<font color="yellow">He got all this with your name and cooking secrets.</font>

552
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,850
<font color="yellow">I erased them all.</font>

553
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,020
<font color="yellow">And this is...</font>

554
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,650
<font color="yellow">where he was born and raised.</font>

555
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,050
<font color="yellow">I will destroy everything so he can never come back.</font>

556
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,780
<font color="yellow">Please wait a little more.</font>

557
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,550
<font color="yellow">Just a little bit more.</font>

558
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,070

<font color="yellow">they'll let you off with a fine.</font>

626
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,430
<font color="yellow">That's what they say,</font>

627
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,550
<font color="yellow">but I can never trust the prosecution.</font>

628
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,880
<font color="yellow">Many men's lives were ruined...</font>

629
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,950
<font color="yellow">after giving into the prosecution's request.</font>

630
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,480
<font color="yellow">If you don't, you'll definitely be put into prison.</font>

631
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,550
<font color="yellow">Well, that's why I'm saying this.</font>

632
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,550
<font color="yellow">If they look deep enough,</font>

633
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,220
<font color="yellow">they will find Goongnak Foundation.</font>

634
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,680
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid you'll get lured in, too.</font>

635
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,250
<font color="yellow">That'll be bad.</font>

636
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,780
<font color="yellow">That's why I ask...</font>

637
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,020
<font color="yellow">to be acquitted.</font>

638
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,180
<font color="yellow">It'll be great for both you and me.</font>

639
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,480
<font color="yellow">You can go and witness.</font>

640
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,380
<font color="yellow">Make sure it doesn't go to Goongnak Foundation.</font>

641
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,550
<font color="yellow">You must stop them.</font>

642
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,550
<font color="yellow">Instead, sell Mr Ha in return.</font>

643
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,230
<font color="yellow">What will happen to his nomination?</font>

644
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,520
<font color="yellow">He must've paid...</font>

645
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,020
<font color="yellow">a fortune for this nomination.</font>

646
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,880
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask him to pay me.</font>

647
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,550
<font color="yellow">He paid me because he wanted to.</font>

648
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,320
<font color="yellow">Call the special department and put an end to this.</font>

649
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,380
<font color="yellow">Some of us will die, and some of us will live on.</font>

650
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, Congressman Choi.</font>

651
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,050
<font color="yellow">That sounds great.</font>

652
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,420
<font color="yellow">You may go home.</font>

653
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,150
<font color="yellow">Did you get what you wanted?</font>

654
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,780
<font color="yellow">In a way.</font>

655
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,650
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

656
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,350
<font color="yellow">You couldn't even make a scratch on me.</font>

657
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:48,950
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha.</font>

658
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,120
<font color="yellow">Congressman Choi is here.</font>

659
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,650
<font color="yellow">Congressman Choi?</font>

660
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,250
<font color="yellow">Nominations for by-elections are reported today, right?</font>

661
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,560
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

662
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,200
<font color="yellow">You must be nervous.</font>

663
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,730
<font color="yellow">I remember when I first walked...</font>

664
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:18,050
<font color="yellow">into Chimyeon Restaurant 30 years ago.</font>

665
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,180
<font color="yellow">I only trusted the royal pheasant buckwheat noodles...</font>

666
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,480
<font color="yellow">when I went in there.</font>

667
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,420
<font color="yellow">That young man with bad hair became who I am today.</font>

668
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,480
<font color="yellow">Who I will be in 30 years will be...</font>

669
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,920
<font color="yellow">decided today.</font>

670
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,450
<font color="yellow">You asked me if I was nervous.</font>

671
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,250
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I am more nervous today...</font>

672
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,550
<font color="yellow">than I was 30 years ago.</font>

673
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,050
<font color="yellow">I am going to the special department.</font>

674
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,220
<font color="yellow">Even the most powerful people get ruined...</font>

675
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,550
<font color="yellow">when they go to...</font>

676
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,620
<font color="yellow">the special department.</font>

677
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,080
<font color="yellow">That department was set up to catch men like us.</font>

678
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,120
<font color="yellow">Even Dokku who received money was released.</font>

679
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,050
<font color="yellow">They can't press charges on lost money.</font>

680
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,820
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha.</font>

681
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,420
<font color="yellow">Don't think ill of me.</font>

682
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,770
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

683
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,850
<font color="yellow">Things don't always go our way, right?</font>

684
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,280
<font color="yellow">It's not like...</font>

685
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,020
<font color="yellow">I wanted things to be like this.</font>

686
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,520
<font color="yellow">Anyway, we should get a drink later.</font>

687
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,750
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the noodles.</font>

690
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,150
<font color="yellow">I feel so refreshed.</font>

691
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,510
<font color="yellow">I don't need anything else.</font>

692
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,380
<font color="yellow">I didn't know they'd drop him for something like this.</font>

693
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,250
<font color="yellow">A prickle under my nail hurts...</font>

694
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,820
<font color="yellow">more than a spear in someone else's body.</font>

695
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,080
<font color="yellow">They obviously didn't want Mr Ha and his problems.</font>

696
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,720
<font color="yellow">This is why politics is scary.</font>

697
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,680
<font color="yellow">When will Congressman Choi come?</font>

698
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:43,550
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow.</font>

699
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,150
<font color="yellow">You never know when he'll change his mind.</font>

700
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,880
<font color="yellow">Don't let your guard down until then.</font>

701
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

702
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,280
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

703
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,650
<font color="yellow">how much further are you planning to go with Mr Ha?</font>

704
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,100
<font color="yellow">Foreign exchange control law? Tax law?</font>

705
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,350
<font color="yellow">I'm going to add murder and murder instigation charges.</font>

706
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,990
<font color="yellow">Make sure you do it right.</font>

707
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,750
<font color="yellow">The harder you try, the harder he'll resist.</font>

<font color="yellow">Do you want a drink?</font>

711
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,580
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

712
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,150
<font color="yellow">I know that you killed my father.</font>

713
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,680
<font color="yellow">But I won't kill someone like my father did.</font>

714
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,480
<font color="yellow">Instead,</font>

715
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,620
<font color="yellow">I will watch you go down...</font>

716
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,480
<font color="yellow">as I stay next to you.</font>

717
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:03,950
<font color="yellow">Did you know?</font>

718
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,380
<font color="yellow">Your daughter...</font>

719
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,780
<font color="yellow">asked me to stop you from sinning.</font>

720
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,250
<font color="yellow">But I know that I can't do that.</font>

721
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,220
<font color="yellow">The only person who can stop you from sinning...</font>

722
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,920
<font color="yellow">is yourself.</font>

723
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,880
<font color="yellow">It's me, Congressman.</font>

724
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,420
<font color="yellow">Did you get a good night's sleep?</font>

725
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,520
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I did.</font>

726
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,020
<font color="yellow">I give up on the nomination.</font>

727
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,720
<font color="yellow">I will no longer bother you...</font>

728
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,380
<font color="yellow">regarding that issue.</font>

729
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,540
<font color="yellow">You make me feel so sorry.</font>

730
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,650
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

731
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,780
<font color="yellow">I can't go to prison.</font>

732
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:21,880
<font color="yellow">I gave up on my dreams,</font>

733
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,380
<font color="yellow">and I gave up Goongnak Foundation.</font>

734
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,020
<font color="yellow">I don't think I deserve to go to prison.</font>

735
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,980
<font color="yellow">I want to meet you...</font>

736

<font color="yellow">and Congressman Choi.</font>

737
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,320
<font color="yellow">Please intervene.</font>

738
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,110
<font color="yellow">It's not too hard for us to meet,</font>

739
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,710
<font color="yellow">but it won't be easy...</font>

740
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,060
<font color="yellow">to persuade the prosecution.</font>

741
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,180
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

742
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,630

<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Congressman Choi.</font>

753
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,330
<font color="yellow">I won't let you get away with breaking this promise.</font>

754
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,520
<font color="yellow">I'm so scared.</font>

755
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,920
<font color="yellow">I just got goose bumps.</font>

756
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,680
<font color="yellow">I wish I can show you.</font>

781
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,590
<font color="yellow">the way we plan them to. I hope you understand.</font>

782
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for making you worried.</font>

783
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,310
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

784
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,720
<font color="yellow">I have a weak heart.</font>

785
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,380
<font color="yellow">Don't you have something to give to us?</font>

786
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,870
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

787
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,050
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

788
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,920
<font color="yellow">My life depends...</font>

789
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,520
<font color="yellow">on what you'll say.</font>

790
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,220
<font color="yellow">We all have to help each other out.</font>

791
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,360
<font color="yellow">And even if you get elected,</font>

792
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,420
<font color="yellow">there are people who get dropped later.</font>

793
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,100
<font color="yellow">What do they call it?</font>

794
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, right, it's "vacancy".</font>

795
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,850
<font color="yellow">They call those empty seats "vacancy".</font>

796
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:26,250
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to say that there are other opportunities.</font>

797
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,620
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

798
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:43,550
<font color="yellow">You seem determined to witness. I will trust you.</font>

799
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,460
<font color="yellow">Let's begin with our basic investigation.</font>

800
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,580
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

801
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,620
<font color="yellow">Hwang Sung Rok.</font>

802
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,380
<font color="yellow">What was your position at Goongnakwon?</font>

803
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,920
<font color="yellow">I was Ha Jung Tae's personal assistant...</font>

804
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,380
<font color="yellow">and the operational manager of Goongnakwon.</font>

805
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,630
<font color="yellow">For which crime of his will you be witnessing?</font>

806
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,320
<font color="yellow">Murder, murder instigation,</font>

807
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,080
<font color="yellow">numbers of embezzlement, breach of duties,</font>

808
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,380
<font color="yellow">fabrication of the official documents,</font>

809
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,950
<font color="yellow">assault, threat and much more.</font>

810
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,620
<font color="yellow">I will witness on all of these.</font>

811
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,530
<font color="yellow">I guess you haven't quit smoking.</font>

812
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:40,950
<font color="yellow">I smoke from time to time...</font>

813
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,720
<font color="yellow">when I get frustrated, like now.</font>

814
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,420
<font color="yellow">Are you going to smoke?</font>

815
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,380
<font color="yellow">Don't do it, Gil Do.</font>

816
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,650
<font color="yellow">I'll put it back.</font>

817
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,060
<font color="yellow">- Then...
-  One.</font>

818
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,370
<font color="yellow">nothing happened, okay?</font>

819
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,920
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

820
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,880
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

821
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,170
<font color="yellow">You're scaring me.</font>

822
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:18,480
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

823
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,220
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

824
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,950
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

825
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,180
<font color="yellow">Kim Gil Do!</font>

826
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,080
<font color="yellow">Three.</font>

827
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,220
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

828
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,750
<font color="yellow">What have you done?</font>

829
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,320
<font color="yellow">We now have...</font>

830
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,180
<font color="yellow">a vacancy.</font>

831
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,020
<font color="yellow">Can I...</font>

832
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,280
<font color="yellow">take that spot?</font>

833
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,520
<font color="yellow">(Master of Revenge)</font>
