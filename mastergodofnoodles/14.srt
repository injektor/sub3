93

94

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,520
<font color="yellow">They're fine, Sir.</font>

101
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,990
<font color="yellow">There was a sign of an outsider having broken into the secret room.</font>

102
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,450
<font color="yellow">That's why I changed the access system. It was like a trap.</font>

<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

107
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,250

112
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,620
<font color="yellow">You told me to protect her.</font>

113

114
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,420
<font color="yellow">I told you to watch her.</font>

<font color="yellow">Can't you tell the difference?</font>

116
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,880
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

117
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,120

124
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,520
<font color="yellow">more than what you're bringing in?</font>

125
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,620
<font color="yellow">Get some rest.</font>

126
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,950

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,150
<font color="yellow">I have a TV interview the day after tomorrow.</font>

143
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420

<font color="yellow">It's what you wanted, so I'm sure you'll do well.</font>

<font color="yellow">but survived miraculously.</font>

152
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,180
<font color="yellow">Then one day, his young son played with fire,</font>

153
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,650

156
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,080

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,220
<font color="yellow">I can't until everyone is here.</font>

160
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,450
<font color="yellow">Please call Kim Da Hae.</font>

161
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,850
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

162
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,520
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha wants to see you.</font>

163
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,550
<font color="yellow">I won't go.</font>

164
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,650
<font color="yellow">You have to witness the reading of Mr Ko's will.</font>

165
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,320
<font color="yellow">You're mentioned in it.</font>

166
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
<font color="yellow">Why me?</font>

167
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,180
<font color="yellow">See for yourself.</font>

168
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,020
<font color="yellow">Everyone has to be present for the reading.</font>

169
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,080
<font color="yellow">Everyone's waiting.</font>

170
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,750
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

171
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,450
<font color="yellow">Everyone's here, so I'll begin.</font>

172
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,350
<font color="yellow">I, Ko Dae Cheon,</font>

173
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,020
<font color="yellow">leave all my savings and the land on which...</font>

174
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,750
<font color="yellow">Chimyeon Restaurant stood in Masan...</font>

175
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,050
<font color="yellow">to my daughter, Ko Gang Sook.</font>

176
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,880
<font color="yellow">I, Ko Dae Cheon, leave the title of Noodle Master...</font>

177
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,150
<font color="yellow">that was handed down four generations...</font>

178
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,320
<font color="yellow">to my son-in-law, Ha Jung Tae.</font>

179
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,820
<font color="yellow">I, Ko Dae Cheon, leave the 20 percent of...</font>

180
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,120
<font color="yellow">Goongnakwon's shares that are in my name...</font>

181
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,080
<font color="yellow">to Kim Da Hae of the Noodle Team.</font>

182
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,580
<font color="yellow">That is all.</font>

183
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,980
<font color="yellow">This makes no sense.</font>

184
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,650
<font color="yellow">Why are his shares going to her?</font>

185
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,750
<font color="yellow">What did you do to my father?</font>

186
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,880
<font color="yellow">Did you cajole him while pretending to nurse him?</font>

187
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,720
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

188
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,350
<font color="yellow">How can I calm down?</font>

189
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,020
<font color="yellow">You're in this with her.</font>

190
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,650
<font color="yellow">One of you drugged and confused him...</font>

191
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,650
<font color="yellow">and the other coaxed him.</font>

192
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,750
<font color="yellow">Why don't you try and explain?</font>

193
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,350
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

194
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,520
<font color="yellow">Do you feel guilty?</font>

195
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,250
<font color="yellow">Do you even have a conscience?</font>

196
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,020
<font color="yellow">Watch yourself. We have a guest.</font>

197
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,180
<font color="yellow">I have no reason to stay.</font>

198
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,180
<font color="yellow">Do excuse me.</font>

199
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,850
<font color="yellow">Stay right there!</font>

200
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,750
<font color="yellow">You can't toy with us...</font>

201
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,320
<font color="yellow">and then leave.</font>

202
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,720
<font color="yellow">I'm not the one who toys with others.</font>

203
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,520
<font color="yellow">You are.</font>

204
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,920
<font color="yellow">You hurt people beyond healing...</font>

205
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,250
<font color="yellow">and think money will clear things up.</font>

206
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,420
<font color="yellow">That chills me to the bone.</font>

207
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,880
<font color="yellow">Kim Da Hae!</font>

208
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,520
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

209
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,750
<font color="yellow">I must've looked like a lunatic.</font>

210
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,450
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel.</font>

211
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,420
<font color="yellow">I would have done the same.</font>

212
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,220
<font color="yellow">He left his shares to a stranger.</font>

213
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,520
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what he was thinking.</font>

214
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,350
<font color="yellow">There's no point in wondering or regretting now.</font>

215
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,250
<font color="yellow">It's all over.</font>

216
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,350
<font color="yellow">It's not over yet.</font>

217
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,980
<font color="yellow">There must be a way to get the shares back.</font>

218
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,750
<font color="yellow">We will get it back.</font>

219
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,120
<font color="yellow">We can't.</font>

220
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,750
<font color="yellow">It's spilt milk.</font>

221
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,120
<font color="yellow">Give me time to figure it out.</font>

222
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,250
<font color="yellow">Da Hae...</font>

223
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,650
<font color="yellow">is my husband's daughter.</font>

224
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,650
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

225
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,750
<font color="yellow">The two will gang up against us.</font>

226
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,620
<font color="yellow">We can't beat them.</font>

227
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,050
<font color="yellow">That little witch.</font>

228
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,880
<font color="yellow">She played us all.</font>

229
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,350
<font color="yellow">I'll have to do something.</font>

230
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,150
<font color="yellow">We have to teach her a lesson to show her how things work.</font>

231
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,880
<font color="yellow">I know how you feel.</font>

232
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,020
<font color="yellow">You got your shares out of nowhere,</font>

233
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,820
<font color="yellow">but people treat you like a thief.</font>

234
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,720
<font color="yellow">You never asked for it,</font>

235
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,190
<font color="yellow">and you don't think it belongs to you.</font>

236
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,350
<font color="yellow">I don't care about the shares.</font>

237
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,150
<font color="yellow">You aren't on great terms with Mr Ha,</font>

238
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,190
<font color="yellow">and you've gone way beyond the point of no return with Ms Ko.</font>

239
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,750
<font color="yellow">I'm saying I can help you.</font>

240
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,820
<font color="yellow">You're talented.</font>

241
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,450
<font color="yellow">You have a great sense of smell, you're passionate,</font>

242
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,320
<font color="yellow">and you love making noodles.</font>

243
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,450
<font color="yellow">You don't have to fight over the shares.</font>

244
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,120
<font color="yellow">If you trust me,</font>

245
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,020
<font color="yellow">I'll help you achieve your dream within Goongnakwon.</font>

246
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,080
<font color="yellow">I don't even know what my dream is.</font>

247
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,650
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

248
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,420
<font color="yellow">All I learned from you is to doubt others.</font>

249
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,380
<font color="yellow">It feels odd hearing you asking for my trust.</font>

250
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,950
<font color="yellow">I'll think about the shares.</font>

251
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,250
<font color="yellow">I still think they don't belong to me.</font>

252
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,750
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

253
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,020
<font color="yellow">Tell us the secret of your dough.</font>

254
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,750
<font color="yellow">It's not hard at all. It's all about the push and pull.</font>

255
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,550
<font color="yellow">For example, it's like me telling you...</font>

256
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,320
<font color="yellow">that you have a pretty face, but an ugly personality.</font>

257
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,750
<font color="yellow">That really is a harsh example.</font>

258
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,780
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I was trying to think of an example.</font>

259
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,150
<font color="yellow">That's all right. But what does that have to do with kneading dough?</font>

260
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,750
<font color="yellow">It's the same principle.</font>

261
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,320
<font color="yellow">You have to put love into it as you beat it down at the same time.</font>

262
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,690
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

263
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,250
<font color="yellow">Pat it.</font>

264
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,850
<font color="yellow">- Pat it. - And knead it.</font>

265
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,150
<font color="yellow">And knead it.</font>

266
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,580
<font color="yellow">- And again. - Okay.</font>

267
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,690
<font color="yellow">- Pat it. - Pat it.</font>

268
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,020
<font color="yellow">- And knead it. - And knead it.</font>

269
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,750
<font color="yellow">Pat it.</font>

270
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,950
<font color="yellow">And knead it.</font>

271
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,050
<font color="yellow">And knead it. It's so easy.</font>

272
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,050
<font color="yellow">Noodles have to be quick and simple to make.</font>

273
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,350
<font color="yellow">If noodles were hard to make, they wouldn't be so widely loved.</font>

274
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,650
<font color="yellow">What a great answer.</font>

275
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,350
<font color="yellow">Next, I'll show you how to make a broth.</font>

276
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,450
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to host my show, too?</font>

277
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,550
<font color="yellow">Shall we change places?</font>

278
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,620
<font color="yellow">I suddenly feel threatened.</font>

279
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,750
<font color="yellow">He isn't too bad.</font>

280
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,690
<font color="yellow">You pulled out at the last minute, and he saved the day.</font>

281
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,250
<font color="yellow">I can't smile on national TV when I'm in mourning.</font>

282
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,880
<font color="yellow">The ratings doubled compared to when you were on.</font>

283
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,150
<font color="yellow">He's pretty to look at and tall,</font>

284
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,150
<font color="yellow">and he makes me feel good.</font>

285
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,650
<font color="yellow">He might even have an online fan forum.</font>

286
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,380
<font color="yellow">You need to smile more.</font>

287
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,580
<font color="yellow">I'll teach you how to smile in different situations.</font>

288
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,250
<font color="yellow">What about crying?</font>

289
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,850
<font color="yellow">Did you ever cry?</font>

290
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,680
<font color="yellow">Tears pooled in my eyes just once.</font>

291
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,380
<font color="yellow">I was incredibly sad, but the tears wouldn't fall.</font>

292
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,550
<font color="yellow">Let's give it a go.</font>

293
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,450
<font color="yellow">Though I can't imagine you crying.</font>

294
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,850
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

295
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,120
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make noodles.</font>

296
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,780
<font color="yellow">Who gave permission?</font>

297
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,650
<font color="yellow">Scream if you want to. You're good at that.</font>

298
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,150
<font color="yellow">Do you even know how?</font>

299
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,550
<font color="yellow">Anyone can cook noodles.</font>

300
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,650
<font color="yellow">Where are the somen noodles?</font>

301
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,620
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that our noodles are handmade?</font>

302
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,420
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

303
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,220
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that.</font>

304
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,420
<font color="yellow">How about sujebi, then?</font>

305
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,050
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

306
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,150
<font color="yellow">trying to cook for me?</font>

307
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,020
<font color="yellow">Can't I?</font>

308
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,550
<font color="yellow">Do you know what?</font>

309
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,250
<font color="yellow">It's the first time you smiled in three days.</font>

310
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,120
<font color="yellow">Why were you counting that?</font>

311
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,380
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I just was, I guess.</font>

312
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,250
<font color="yellow">Taste it.</font>

313
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,020
<font color="yellow">Hey, you aren't too bad.</font>

314
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,480
<font color="yellow">I'm just asking because I'm curious. Can't you speak freely to me?</font>

315
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,150
<font color="yellow">I can.</font>

316
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,020
<font color="yellow">Don't people say you're uptight?</font>

317
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,620
<font color="yellow">Especially women.</font>

318
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,450
<font color="yellow">No woman has ever said that.</font>

319
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,250
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

320
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,550
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to believe that?</font>

321
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,380
<font color="yellow">I've never had a girlfriend.</font>

322
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,850
<font color="yellow">You sweet potato.</font>

323
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

324
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,650
<font color="yellow">Sweet potato?</font>

325
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,150
<font color="yellow">My goodness. This is incredible. It really is.</font>

326
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,620
<font color="yellow">Did you see the long line?</font>

327
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,880
<font color="yellow">I bet it goes all the way to Daejeon.</font>

328
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,050
<font color="yellow">It can't possibly reach Daejeon.</font>

329
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,380
<font color="yellow">It must reach Busan at least.</font>

330
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,850
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

331
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,880
<font color="yellow">Look at your handsome face.</font>

332
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,650
<font color="yellow">Just a few hours in the spotlight, and your face is shining.</font>

333
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,250
<font color="yellow">You're embarrassing me.</font>

334
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,250
<font color="yellow">Our daily sales doubled since you took over.</font>

335
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,750
<font color="yellow">Don't feel embarrassed.</font>

336
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,320
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

337
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,520
<font color="yellow">Mr Park doesn't nap now that he's Deputy Head of Noodles.</font>

338
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,520
<font color="yellow">He's so alert now.</font>

339
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,220
<font color="yellow">How can I nap when my boss glares each time I blink?</font>

340
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,620
<font color="yellow">I have such a hard time working under an evil superior.</font>

341
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,620
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

342
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,320
<font color="yellow">Da Hae would've been so happy if she were here.</font>

343
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,550
<font color="yellow">She stays in her room all day instead of coming to work.</font>

344
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,520
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for her.</font>

345
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,250
<font color="yellow">She was given 20 percent of Goongnakwon's shares.</font>

346
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,050
<font color="yellow">Would you want to work if you were her?</font>

347
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,220
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - 20 percent?</font>

348
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,250
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - What?</font>

349
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,950
<font color="yellow">How much is that worth?</font>

350
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,620
<font color="yellow">But why her?</font>

351
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,850
<font color="yellow">Did you know about this?</font>

352
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,650
<font color="yellow">- Mr Ha and Ms Ko were furious. - Well...</font>

353
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,850
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Forget about it.</font>

354
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,250
<font color="yellow">Let's get ready before the customers flock in.</font>

355
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,450
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Let's get to work.</font>

356
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,750
<font color="yellow">Gosh, 20 percent?</font>

357
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,120
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

358
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,120
<font color="yellow">You don't seem surprised. Did you know about it?</font>

359
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,680
<font color="yellow">I suspected something,</font>

360
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,250
<font color="yellow">though I didn't know they were related.</font>

361
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,520
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha now has half of Goongnakwon's shares.</font>

362
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,520
<font color="yellow">We might lose everything we fought for.</font>

363
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,880
<font color="yellow">I think your father will be proud of you.</font>

364
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,680
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about him.</font>

365
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,580
<font color="yellow">Don't you tell your parents that you work here?</font>

366
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,680
<font color="yellow">I said stop.</font>

367
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,680
<font color="yellow">There's no guarantee that her shares will go to him.</font>

368
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,450
<font color="yellow">It is likely, though.</font>

369
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,480
<font color="yellow">We had a chat, but I couldn't get through to her.</font>

370
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,850
<font color="yellow">Let me talk to her.</font>

371
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,680
<font color="yellow">Someone else is working his arms off while you're enjoying a holiday.</font>

372
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,750
<font color="yellow">It's killing me.</font>

373
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,020
<font color="yellow">I want to get out of here, but I have no place to go.</font>

374
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,420
<font color="yellow">Are you free?</font>

375
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,580
<font color="yellow">Shall we go out for some noodles?</font>

376
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,750
<font color="yellow">You haven't had any in a while.</font>

377
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,650
<font color="yellow">My hands shake if I don't eat noodles for even a day.</font>

378
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,050
<font color="yellow">It's so strange.</font>

379
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,780
<font color="yellow">The broth was made with anchovies, large-eyed herring and kelp,</font>

380
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,750
<font color="yellow">and you just boiled store-bought somen noodles.</font>

381
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,150
<font color="yellow">But how is it so tasty?</font>

382
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,020
<font color="yellow">It's in the hands.</font>

383
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,680
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to quit?</font>

384
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,950
<font color="yellow">Is there talk?</font>

385
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,250
<font color="yellow">You own 20 percent of the shares.</font>

386
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,680
<font color="yellow">You're rich now.</font>

387
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,750
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to get on your good side.</font>

388
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,780
<font color="yellow">Just like someone said, it was given to me so suddenly.</font>

389
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,420
<font color="yellow">I don't know much about shares,</font>

390
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,520
<font color="yellow">and I don't really care.</font>

391
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,380
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha, Ms Ko and Ms Seol...</font>

392
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,250
<font color="yellow">all want it.</font>

393
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,150
<font color="yellow">Just pick someone and give it all away.</font>

394
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,350
<font color="yellow">Now, I'll talk to you as the head of noodles.</font>

395
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,620
<font color="yellow">We need you in the kitchen.</font>

396
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,850
<font color="yellow">Mope and wander all you want as long as you promise to come back.</font>

397
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,950
<font color="yellow">I'll wait for you.</font>

398
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,420
<font color="yellow">You said you have nowhere to go.</font>

399
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,680
<font color="yellow">You can stay here. I can stay at Goongnakwon.</font>

400
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,450
<font color="yellow">You'll be able to think here, and no one will bother you.</font>

401
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,450
<font color="yellow">You can use anything you find in the fridge.</font>

402
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,850
<font color="yellow">I have to go back to work.</font>

403
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,680
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

404
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,750
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

405
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,220
<font color="yellow">He should wash it.</font>

406
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,280
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Chae.</font>

407
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,680
<font color="yellow">While investigating Ha Jung Tae, I found this.</font>

408
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,650
<font color="yellow">His whereabouts were unknown while he was wanted.</font>

409
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,150
<font color="yellow">But soon after the case expired,</font>

410
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,550
<font color="yellow">he renewed his resident and family registration...</font>

411
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,850
<font color="yellow">and even his seal impression all at once.</font>

412
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
<font color="yellow">Where is his residence?</font>

413
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,450
<font color="yellow">It's in Bongpyeong, Gangwon Province.</font>

414
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,950
<font color="yellow">You are Myeong's friend, aren't you?</font>

415
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,280
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

416
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,550
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

417
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,850
<font color="yellow">Because...</font>

418
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,320
<font color="yellow">Please don't get me wrong.</font>

419
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,450
<font color="yellow">I'm staying here for a while for personal reasons.</font>

420
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,820
<font color="yellow">I mean, we didn't stay here together.</font>

421
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,480
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Let me explain.</font>

422
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,820
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

423
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,650

424
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,580

425
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,480
<font color="yellow">Da Hae is doing well. Don't worry about her.</font>

426
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,380
<font color="yellow">- Where is she? - She will be back soon. So...</font>

427
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,020
<font color="yellow">I told you before.</font>

428
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,280
<font color="yellow">Don't involve innocent people.</font>

429
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,120
<font color="yellow">Then you should take better care of her.</font>

430
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,550
<font color="yellow">Can't you reach Da Hae yet?</font>

431
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,920
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry, Sir. - Never mind.</font>

432
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,450
<font color="yellow">I will see her today anyway.</font>

433
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,020
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

434
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,650
<font color="yellow">I should have been here sooner.</font>

435
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,250
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry being so late.</font>

436
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,150
<font color="yellow">Da Hae finally...</font>

437
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,950
<font color="yellow">found out about your death.</font>

438
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,820
<font color="yellow">I told her.</font>

439
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,020

440
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,820
<font color="yellow">she'd never let it go. So I told her.</font>

<font color="yellow">I couldn't see my daughter mourning over...</font>

442

<font color="yellow">the death of the murderer who killed her mother.</font>

443

444
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,480

445
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,280
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do.</font>

446
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,750
<font color="yellow">Please tell me.</font>

447
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,920
<font color="yellow">I now understand how actors feel.</font>

448
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,150
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Sir?</font>

449
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,750
<font color="yellow">I mean their tears.</font>

450
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,550
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure...</font>

452
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,350
<font color="yellow">They were false tears.</font>

453
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,550
<font color="yellow">Why would you shed false tears?</font>

454
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,450
<font color="yellow">I heard about the 20 percent share.</font>

455
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,320
<font color="yellow">How did you feel?</font>

456

<font color="yellow">Da Hae.</font>

467
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,950
<font color="yellow">I need to see you.</font>

468
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,020
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

469
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,020
<font color="yellow">about the other day.</font>

00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,020
<font color="yellow">My father...</font>

471
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,150
<font color="yellow">passed away so suddenly.</font>

472
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,950
<font color="yellow">I was out of my mind.</font>

473
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,380
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

474
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,450
<font color="yellow">Please accept it.</font>

475
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,590
<font color="yellow">I guess I really like you a lot.</font>

476
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:17,650
<font color="yellow">I thought you were betraying me with your father, so I was upset.</font>

477
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
<font color="yellow">Da Hae.</font>

478
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,350
<font color="yellow">You know that you are like a daughter to me.</font>

479
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,220
<font color="yellow">Nothing has changed.</font>

480
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,650
<font color="yellow">I care about you that much.</font>

481
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,850
<font color="yellow">And I really like you.</font>

482
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,120
<font color="yellow">So you should...</font>

483
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,180
<font color="yellow">remember the promise...</font>

484
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,220
<font color="yellow">between us.</font>

485
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,020
<font color="yellow">We can count on each other...</font>

487
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,650
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

489
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,850

491
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,550
<font color="yellow">I can't make any decision for now.</font>

492
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,180
<font color="yellow">Please understand me.</font>

493
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,650
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

494
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,450
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to help me.</font>

495
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,050
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying we should be on the same side.</font>

496
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,950
<font color="yellow">Don't you understand?</font>

497
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,150
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have come here.</font>

498
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,850
<font color="yellow">How you not understand what I'm saying?</font>

499
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,550
<font color="yellow">If you keep acting like this,</font>

500
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,680
<font color="yellow">I won't let you get by so easily.</font>

501
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,950
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

502
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,220
<font color="yellow">People never change.</font>

503
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,650
<font color="yellow">I almost forgot about that.</font>

504
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,350
<font color="yellow">Right. People never change. How can people change?</font>

505
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,480
<font color="yellow">They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.</font>

506

<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

507
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,380
<font color="yellow">just like your father.</font>

508
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,150
<font color="yellow">Do you even know...</font>

509
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,050
<font color="yellow">who killed my mother?</font>

510
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,050
<font color="yellow">I don't think you have the right...</font>

511

<font color="yellow">to say that to me.</font>

512
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,250
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat?</font>

513
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,650
<font color="yellow">I will, Sir.</font>

514
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,020
<font color="yellow">I've been coming to this place for 30 years.</font>

515
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,350
<font color="yellow">There are many restaurants who serve better dishes,</font>

516
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,050
<font color="yellow">but I feel really comfortable here.</font>

517
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,450
<font color="yellow">The food is delicious.</font>

518
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

519
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,650
<font color="yellow">The dumplings remind me of my father.</font>

520
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,650
<font color="yellow">My father was a drunk.</font>

521
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,450
<font color="yellow">Whenever he hit me, he bought me a pack of dumplings that night.</font>

522
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,820
<font color="yellow">My lips and mouth were all sore,</font>

523
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,090
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't stop eating the dumplings since they were so good.</font>

524
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,380
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, I even made him mad on purpose...</font>

525

<font color="yellow">to eat some dumplings.</font>

526
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,320
<font color="yellow">I wanted him to buy me dumplings.</font>

528
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,180
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

529
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,650
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I became successful?</font>

530
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,950
<font color="yellow">It's because I don't have friends.</font>

531
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,680
<font color="yellow">The moment you run out of money, your food runs out first.</font>

532
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,780
<font color="yellow">After that, your friends walk out on you.</font>

533

<font color="yellow">You should...</font>

534
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,590
<font color="yellow">live for yourself, too.</font>

535
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,520
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who can save yourself.</font>

536

<font color="yellow">Do you know how I became successful?</font>

537
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,050

538
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,520
<font color="yellow">This place looks neater than before.</font>

541
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,520
<font color="yellow">It smells different, too.</font>

542
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,380
<font color="yellow">Something is fishy.</font>

543
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,750

558
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,380
<font color="yellow">Ha Jung Tae was wanted in college for violating National Security Law.</font>

559

<font color="yellow">He went low for a while.</font>

774

775

<font color="yellow">You don't need to wander off.</font>

780

<font color="yellow">my mother's death,</font>

782
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,320

783
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,080
<font color="yellow">I like noodles.</font>

784
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,250
<font color="yellow">I don't really care about those shares.</font>

785
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,820

790
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,350
<font color="yellow">I won't approve of this.</font>

791
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,580

<font color="yellow">with your shares. Not a chance.</font>

793
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,320
<font color="yellow">This is a power of attorney...</font>

796
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:54,050

803
