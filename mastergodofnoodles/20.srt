<font color="yellow">I want to stop feeling guilty whenever I look at you.</font>

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,224
<font color="yellow">Friends? It means nothing.</font>

10
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:28,424
<font color="yellow">Yeo Kyung lied, too.</font>

11
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:33,624
<font color="yellow">We both said something we never should've said.</font>

26
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,551
<font color="yellow">You haven't shown up in the kitchen for a week now.</font>

27
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:12,861
<font color="yellow">Everything is out of order. Customers are complaining.</font>

28
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:15,051
<font color="yellow">If this goes on, we'll soon be closing the restaurant.</font>

29
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:17,291
<font color="yellow">Close the restaurant.</font>

30
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:20,091
<font color="yellow">It's weird for it to be still open.</font>

31
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,891

00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,551

<font color="yellow">noodles that were once cooked by a murderer?</font>

34
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:32,191
<font color="yellow">Close the restaurant until people forget about him.</font>

35
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:34,361
<font color="yellow">That's the right thing to do.</font>

36
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,391
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that he killed your parents.</font>

37
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,451
<font color="yellow">The fact that Kim Gil Do is a murderer...</font>

38
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:46,791
<font color="yellow">was also a big shock to all of us.</font>

39
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:51,591
<font color="yellow">But what does Goongnakwon have to do with anything?</font>

40
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,221
<font color="yellow">We all worked very hard to get here.</font>

41
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,591
<font color="yellow">I can't just stand by and watch it go down like this.</font>

42
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,051
<font color="yellow">It's unacceptable. I won't allow it.</font>

43
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,051
<font color="yellow">Resign from Master of Noodles.</font>

44
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,851
<font color="yellow">You are the one who messed up Goongnakwon.</font>

45
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:10,351
<font color="yellow">You were supposed to protect it,</font>

46
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,091
<font color="yellow">but you ruined it instead.</font>

47
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,221
<font color="yellow">Leave right now.</font>

48
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:16,851
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

49
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,621
<font color="yellow">I have to keep my place.</font>

50
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:22,691
<font color="yellow">Kim Gil Do will definitely show up.</font>

51
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:26,821
<font color="yellow">Even if someone has to die, that's when it'll end.</font>

52
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,221
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

53
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,051
<font color="yellow">My friend died.</font>

54
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,921
<font color="yellow">Burning with vengeance against Kim Gil Do,</font>

55
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:37,321
<font color="yellow">I didn't even care about my friends.</font>

56
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,591
<font color="yellow">I'm the one...</font>

57
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:43,691
<font color="yellow">who led them into this mess.</font>

58
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:45,421
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

59
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:48,691
<font color="yellow">practically the reason why Tae Ha died.</font>

60
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:55,821
<font color="yellow">Ms Seol.</font>

61
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,691
<font color="yellow">Let me give you a word of advice.</font>

62
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:02,921
<font color="yellow">You don't want my anger firing towards you.</font>

63
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:06,791
<font color="yellow">I don't think you'd be able to handle it.</font>

64
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,891
<font color="yellow">So just sit tight.</font>

65
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:12,021
<font color="yellow">At least until Kim Gil Do dies.</font>

66
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:15,591
<font color="yellow">Let me give you a word of advice, too.</font>

67
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,121
<font color="yellow">Don't get innocent people involved in your revenge.</font>

68
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:27,821
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

69
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:30,891
<font color="yellow">you're no longer the top head of noodles to me.</font>

70
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,791
<font color="yellow">I will drag you down from that position,</font>

71
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,351
<font color="yellow">no matter what it takes.</font>

72
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,221
<font color="yellow">He thinks he can have everything his way.</font>

73
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:57,291
<font color="yellow">How worse will it be when he becomes the noodle master?</font>

74
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:00,551
<font color="yellow">Gang Sook, aren't you going to do anything about it?</font>

75
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,621
<font color="yellow">Are you even listening to me?</font>

76
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:08,161
<font color="yellow">My gosh, why are you being so cold-hearted?</font>

77
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,951
<font color="yellow">His friend just died.</font>

78
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:12,521
<font color="yellow">We should give him some time to grieve.</font>

79
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,821
<font color="yellow">What's your problem? You're acting like a dictator.</font>

80
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:21,121
<font color="yellow">What? A dictator? Hey!</font>

81
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,351
<font color="yellow">What? I didn't say anything wrong.</font>

82
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,221
<font color="yellow">After getting the shares from Mr Ha,</font>

83
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,351
<font color="yellow">you're poking around here and there.</font>

84
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,421
<font color="yellow">Just try to understand others.</font>

85
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:34,551
<font color="yellow">I understand the restaurant is important,</font>

86
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,421
<font color="yellow">but nothing is more important than people.</font>

87
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:37,621
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

88
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,951
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

89
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,421
<font color="yellow">you don't get carsick.</font>

90
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:54,551
<font color="yellow">I do, if I have an empty stomach.</font>

91
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,151
<font color="yellow">Let go of me before I scream.</font>

92
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,491
<font color="yellow">You're the thief, not me.</font>

93
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,491
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

94
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:05,751
<font color="yellow">Oh, no! Hide.</font>

95
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,591
<font color="yellow">You smell of sweat, car...</font>

96
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,451
<font color="yellow">and dumplings.</font>

97
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,991
<font color="yellow">But when all that combines together,</font>

98
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:36,451
<font color="yellow">do you know what it smells like?</font>

99
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:39,591
<font color="yellow">It smells like Tae Ha.</font>

100
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,421
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

101
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,251
<font color="yellow">What are they?</font>

102
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,391
<font color="yellow">They're Tae Ha's stuff.</font>

103
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,091
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

104
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:34,891
<font color="yellow">I keep crying every time I say his name.</font>

105
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,421
<font color="yellow">Tae Ha...</font>

106
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:59,921
<font color="yellow">Don't flatter yourself. I'm just throwing it away.</font>

107
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:02,551
<font color="yellow">Please do me a favour.</font>

108
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,791
<font color="yellow">Please remember my smell.</font>

109
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:35,891
<font color="yellow">Mr Park left a big hole in everyone's hearts.</font>

110
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,951
<font color="yellow">After my father passed away,</font>

111
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:46,761
<font color="yellow">I realised how hard it is to miss someone who left me.</font>

112
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:51,891
<font color="yellow">You have no choice but to cry as much as you want.</font>

113
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:57,191
<font color="yellow">Something has been bothering for a long time.</font>

114
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:07,091
<font color="yellow">I once said you have bad blood in you.</font>

115
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,921
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I had said such a hurtful thing.</font>

116
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,191
<font color="yellow">It's not like my blood is any cleaner.</font>

117
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,451
<font color="yellow">What I said to you kept weight me down...</font>

118
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,261
<font color="yellow">the whole time.</font>

119
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:25,761
<font color="yellow">However hard I tried, I couldn't get it out of my head.</font>

120
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,951
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

121
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:34,021
<font color="yellow">I really mean it, Da Hae.</font>

122
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:38,891
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

123
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,691
<font color="yellow">I knew that...</font>

124
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:44,891
<font color="yellow">you didn't mean it.</font>

125
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,651
<font color="yellow">Myeong will be going through a tough time.</font>

126
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:58,521
<font color="yellow">Ms Seol will make it even worse.</font>

127
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:01,761
<font color="yellow">He'll feel like he's being attacked from all sides.</font>

128
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,351
<font color="yellow">We should protect him.</font>

129
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:04,921
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

130
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:08,221
<font color="yellow">Whatever they say,</font>

131
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:11,651
<font color="yellow">the person who loves noodles the most...</font>

132
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:13,761

133
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,691
<font color="yellow">I will do what I can to help.</font>

134
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:25,421
<font color="yellow">I know very well that you and I...</font>

135
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:30,151
<font color="yellow">can't go back to the day we cooked and ate together.</font>

136
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,091
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

137

<font color="yellow">when we're going through a tough time,</font>

138
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,091
<font color="yellow">we could lend each other a shoulder.</font>

139
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,021
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't that help?</font>

140
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,421
<font color="yellow">I wish that were possible.</font>

141
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:47,121
<font color="yellow">I'll do that, Ma'am.</font>

142
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,291
<font color="yellow">I'd like to...</font>

143
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,121

00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,891
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

159
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:09,221
<font color="yellow">I lived waiting for this day.</font>

160
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:12,191
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

161
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:29,951
<font color="yellow">Do you remember him? Mr Hwang Sung Rok.</font>

162
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,221
<font color="yellow">How could I forget him?</font>

163
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:35,551
<font color="yellow">You look great.</font>

164
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:36,891
<font color="yellow">You lost some weight.</font>

165
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,151
<font color="yellow">Were you under some stress recently?</font>

166
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,621
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

167
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,791
<font color="yellow">I even signed autographs...</font>

168
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:46,821
<font color="yellow">while in hiding.</font>

169
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,891
<font color="yellow">People don't care about me...</font>

170
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,851
<font color="yellow">as much as I thought they would.</font>

171
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,121
<font color="yellow">They will now.</font>

172
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:01,121
<font color="yellow">We'll start with a case you're both involved in.</font>

173
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,791
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim Gil Do.</font>

174
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:05,691
<font color="yellow">On May 27, 2014,</font>

175
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:09,551
<font color="yellow">did you order Mr Hwang's murder under a bridge?</font>

176
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,751
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

177
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:18,991
<font color="yellow">Why would he want me dead?</font>

178

185
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,421

186
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,021
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

187
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,091
<font color="yellow">Every interview is taped and preserved as evidence.</font>

188
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:49,021
<font color="yellow">There was no misunderstanding or threats.</font>

189
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,891
<font color="yellow">What happens if I change my statement?</font>

190
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,921
<font color="yellow">It can't be.</font>

191
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:06,791
<font color="yellow">Did you two...</font>

192
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,191
<font color="yellow">My previous statement is invalid.</font>

193
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,891
<font color="yellow">I want to revise it.</font>

194
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:45,021
<font color="yellow">Get Mr Hwang out of here.</font>

195
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,391
<font color="yellow">Did you bribe a witness...</font>

196
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,321

197
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,391
<font color="yellow">Take things in the way they are.</font>

198
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,921

203
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,961

206

207
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:36,851

212
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,821
<font color="yellow">You decided not to indict him,</font>

213
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,921

216
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,221
<font color="yellow">I didn't disappear.</font>

217
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:11,191
<font color="yellow">I was in an accident and the shock left me panicked.</font>

218
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,921
<font color="yellow">I lost my bearings.</font>

219
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:18,121
<font color="yellow">What about Tae Ha? You killed him.</font>

220
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:20,851
<font color="yellow">You killed him to hide your secrets.</font>

221
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:22,721
<font color="yellow">Stop imagining things.</font>

222
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,021

<font color="yellow">That's what you're doing.</font>

320

322

324
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,051
<font color="yellow">So Tae Seop who killed Tae Ha.</font>

325
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,221

326
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,921
<font color="yellow">If you pick So Tae Seop,</font>

327
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:31,851
<font color="yellow">you and I will become allies for a brief period.</font>

328
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:33,451
<font color="yellow">But if you pick me,</font>

329
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:37,191
<font color="yellow">we must fight until one of us dies.</font>

330

<font color="yellow">There's no other way.</font>

331

333
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,851
<font color="yellow">Show me proof that So Tae Seop killed him.</font>

334
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:56,991
<font color="yellow">I won't believe you unless I see it.</font>

00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:14,391
<font color="yellow">These are photos of Da Hae...</font>

336
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:19,551
<font color="yellow">that So Tae Seop sent me when he kidnapped her.</font>

337
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:23,521

340
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:33,351
<font color="yellow">I'll text you the address. Come over.</font>

341

<font color="yellow">If you die to save your daughter,</font>

342
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,651
<font color="yellow">wouldn't that be a fair trade?</font>

343
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:41,751
<font color="yellow">He made...</font>

344
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:44,391
<font color="yellow">the same call to Tae Ha.</font>

345
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:49,551
<font color="yellow">Tae Ha reached the warehouse before I did,</font>

346
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:52,421
<font color="yellow">and that's how he died.</font>

347
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:56,351
<font color="yellow">So Tae Seop.</font>

348
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,651
<font color="yellow">I'll kill him.</font>

349
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:01,151
<font color="yellow">To do that,</font>

350
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:04,551
<font color="yellow">I need your help.</font>

351
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,821

362
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:19,321
<font color="yellow">My father was a monster who killed two people,</font>

00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,351
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, it wasn't easy.</font>

379
00:29:58,251 --> 00:30:00,091
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to hear that.</font>

380
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:02,721
<font color="yellow">Why were you being so greedy?</font>

381
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,421
<font color="yellow">If you just lived your life the way it was,</font>

382

<font color="yellow">It's not that I'm greedy.</font>

385

<font color="yellow">did you kidnap Da Hae?</font>

390

00:37:27,651 --> 00:37:29,391
<font color="yellow">It has a good consistency.</font>

471
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:32,551
<font color="yellow">And I like the fragrance of buckwheat.</font>

472
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:36,751
<font color="yellow">You are skilled enough...</font>

473
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,051
<font color="yellow">to serve noodles...</font>

474
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,651
<font color="yellow">on your own.</font>

475
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:45,151
<font color="yellow">Who killed...</font>

476
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:48,051
<font color="yellow">Tae Ha?</font>

477
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:53,151
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

478
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:56,151
<font color="yellow">Did you kill him?</font>

479
00:37:57,251 --> 00:37:58,361
<font color="yellow">Was it you?</font>

480
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:03,721
<font color="yellow">Please tell me it wasn't.</font>

481
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:06,391
<font color="yellow">Please tell me that...</font>

482
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,751
<font color="yellow">you didn't kill him.</font>

483
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:13,051
<font color="yellow">I didn't kill him.</font>

484
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:21,751
<font color="yellow">Then who did it?</font>

485
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:25,491
<font color="yellow">Who killed him?</font>

486
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,051
<font color="yellow">Someone you don't know.</font>

487
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:30,251
<font color="yellow">Someone you shouldn't know.</font>

488
00:38:58,251 --> 00:38:59,521
<font color="yellow">It's your fault.</font>

489
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:02,091
<font color="yellow">It's all because of you.</font>

490
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,221
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you answer my call?</font>

491
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:06,121
<font color="yellow">If you had answered my call,</font>

492
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,921
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have been kidnapped.</font>

493
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:10,191
<font color="yellow">Tae Ha...</font>

494
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:12,991
<font color="yellow">got killed while trying to save me.</font>

495
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:16,421
<font color="yellow">He was killed because of me.</font>

496
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:20,421
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

497
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,951
<font color="yellow">If you didn't do bad things, Tae Ha wouldn't have died.</font>

498
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:26,551
<font color="yellow">You're the one who should've died.</font>

499
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:31,091
<font color="yellow">You're the one who committed all the crimes.</font>

500
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:33,451
<font color="yellow">Why does Tae Ha have to be the one to get killed?</font>

501
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:35,551
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

502
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:38,091
<font color="yellow">Why? Why?</font>

503
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:58,361
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

504
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,691
<font color="yellow">It's been a while, Prosecutor.</font>

505
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:04,551
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

506
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:05,861
<font color="yellow">I've been well, thanks to you.</font>

507
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:08,861
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't want to see me for no reason.</font>

508
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:10,791
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

509
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:15,621
<font color="yellow">I found out the man who kidnapped Da Hae.</font>

510
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,151
<font color="yellow">He killed Tae Ha, too.</font>

511
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,321
<font color="yellow">Who is that worthless jerk?</font>

512
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:32,551
<font color="yellow">Send up Chae Yeo Kyung only.</font>

513
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:35,491
<font color="yellow">Block everyone else from entering.</font>

514
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:37,091
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

515
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,291
<font color="yellow">There's no use.</font>

516
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:03,191
<font color="yellow">No one's here to help you.</font>

517
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:06,321
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

518
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:07,621
<font color="yellow">Tae Ha...</font>

519
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,391
<font color="yellow">was a dear friend of mine. But you...</font>

520
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:13,921
<font color="yellow">killed him.</font>

521
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:15,151
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

522
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:18,551
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to hurt me?</font>

523
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:19,691
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

524
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:22,251
<font color="yellow">Tae Ha and I...</font>

525
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:24,421
<font color="yellow">don't kill people.</font>

526
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,751
<font color="yellow">You should use the correct vocabulary.</font>

527
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,551
<font color="yellow">It's not that you don't. You just can't.</font>

528
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:35,121
<font color="yellow">I work for this country.</font>

529
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:38,391
<font color="yellow">You know what will happen to you...</font>

530
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:41,021
<font color="yellow">if you lay a finger on me, right?</font>

531
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:45,791
<font color="yellow">You'll all be gone without a trace. Do you know that?</font>

532
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:50,691
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that I can't kill...</font>

533
00:41:51,691 --> 00:41:53,451
<font color="yellow">since you insist on putting it that way.</font>

534
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:56,091
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

535
00:41:57,361 --> 00:41:59,861
<font color="yellow">there are also people who aren't like us.</font>

536
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:02,751
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

537
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:09,291
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

538
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:19,991
<font color="yellow">Your call has been forwarded...</font>

539
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:08,621
<font color="yellow">The moment I met you...</font>

540
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:11,891
<font color="yellow">30 years ago,</font>

541
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:15,021
<font color="yellow">everything got ruined.</font>

542
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:19,451
<font color="yellow">What would've happened to my life...</font>

543
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:22,991
<font color="yellow">if I hadn't come across that flyer?</font>

544
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:25,621
<font color="yellow">You'd probably be somewhere...</font>

545
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:29,151
<font color="yellow">mimicking someone else's life.</font>

546
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:31,491
<font color="yellow">Then, if you like...</font>

547
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:35,821
<font color="yellow">what you have, you would steal that life completely.</font>

548
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:41,321
<font color="yellow">I thought about living a new life,</font>

549
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:44,091
<font color="yellow">but it's not that easy.</font>

550
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:47,491
<font color="yellow">I'm too tired.</font>

551
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:51,621
<font color="yellow">The whole world knows that you're a murderer.</font>

552
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,891
<font color="yellow">How can you possibly live a new life now?</font>

553
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:59,321
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm thinking of giving up.</font>

554
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,551
<font color="yellow">Gil Do.</font>

555
00:44:05,191 --> 00:44:07,391
<font color="yellow">We can talk this out.</font>

556
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:10,821
<font color="yellow">You want the gold badge, right? I'll give you one.</font>

557
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:12,451
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 10 if that's what you need.</font>

558
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:15,021
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Gil Do. Calm down.</font>

559
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:17,921
<font color="yellow">This is not right. You've misunderstood something.</font>

560
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:19,221
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

561
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,591
<font color="yellow">I will live as a beast...</font>

562
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:26,191
<font color="yellow">for one more day.</font>

563
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:29,951
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

564
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:24,691
<font color="yellow">Were you waiting for me?</font>

565
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:26,721
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

566
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,451
<font color="yellow">Something that a coward like you...</font>

567
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:31,791
<font color="yellow">can never do.</font>

568
00:46:48,591 --> 00:46:49,821
<font color="yellow">Ha Jung Tae.</font>

569
00:46:50,651 --> 00:46:51,721
<font color="yellow">Park Tae Ha.</font>

570
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:57,291
<font color="yellow">You two are dead in a place where I was born.</font>

571
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:01,491
<font color="yellow">In my life, there was a time...</font>

572
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:05,921
<font color="yellow">when I felt guilty for the first and last time.</font>

573
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:08,791
<font color="yellow">It was when...</font>

574
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:11,851
<font color="yellow">I pushed...</font>

575
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,951
<font color="yellow">your father, Ha Jung Tae, off of a cliff.</font>

576
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:18,991
<font color="yellow">I've lived by many names,</font>

577
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:23,791
<font color="yellow">but I was the happiest when I lived as Ha Jung Tae.</font>

578
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,051
<font color="yellow">It felt as if...</font>

579
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:30,221
<font color="yellow">I was born with that name.</font>

580
00:47:30,751 --> 00:47:32,221
<font color="yellow">We had to live in agony...</font>

581
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:35,591
<font color="yellow">because of that happiness of yours.</font>

582
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:40,591
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

583
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,121
<font color="yellow">but I don't feel sorry at all.</font>

584
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:46,451
<font color="yellow">All I did was do my best...</font>

585
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:49,751
<font color="yellow">to survive.</font>

586
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:52,721
<font color="yellow">Is that...</font>

587
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:54,951
<font color="yellow">so wrong?</font>

588
00:47:56,691 --> 00:47:58,351
<font color="yellow">You are a beast.</font>

589
00:48:06,921 --> 00:48:11,321
<font color="yellow">I thought about mimicking another life again.</font>

590
00:48:12,321 --> 00:48:13,321
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

591
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:17,151
<font color="yellow">I am too tired to do that now.</font>

592
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:37,251
<font color="yellow">I stole...</font>

593
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:40,291
<font color="yellow">your father's recipe note.</font>

594
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:43,421
<font color="yellow">That was...</font>

595
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:46,321
<font color="yellow">the beginning of Goongnakwon.</font>

596
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:01,891
<font color="yellow">I have one bullet left.</font>

597
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:05,951
<font color="yellow">I either shoot you...</font>

598
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:07,621
<font color="yellow">or...</font>

599
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:10,491
<font color="yellow">myself.</font>

600
00:49:10,621 --> 00:49:11,891
<font color="yellow">It's either one of the two.</font>

601
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:40,751
<font color="yellow">How many people do you think...</font>

602
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:43,351
<font color="yellow">get to die in the place they were born?</font>

603
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:46,851
<font color="yellow">Is it an unfortunate thing...</font>

604
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:48,821
<font color="yellow">or a fortunate thing?</font>

605
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:50,121
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

606
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:55,021
<font color="yellow">You can't die that easily.</font>

607
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:56,651
<font color="yellow">Myeong.</font>

608
00:49:58,221 --> 00:49:59,391
<font color="yellow">No, Soon Seok.</font>

609
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:02,351
<font color="yellow">This isn't you getting your revenge.</font>

610
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:05,421
<font color="yellow">It's me putting and end to this myself.</font>

611
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:10,321
<font color="yellow">The beginning and ending...</font>

612
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:13,991
<font color="yellow">is always judged and decided...</font>

613
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:17,021
<font color="yellow">by me.</font>

614
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:27,791
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

615
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:45,521
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

616
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:51,021
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

617
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:55,221
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

618
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:11,621
<font color="yellow">Hey, Prosecutor Chae.</font>

619
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:13,851
<font color="yellow">Take a seat.</font>

620
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:16,051
<font color="yellow">You don't have to report your expulsion.</font>

621
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,021
<font color="yellow">I came to turn myself in.</font>

622
00:51:20,821 --> 00:51:21,821
<font color="yellow">Turn yourself in?</font>

623
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:25,221
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you committed a crime?</font>

624
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:30,391
<font color="yellow">On November 10, 2007,</font>

625
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:33,451
<font color="yellow">there was a murder case at Sarang Orphanage,</font>

626
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,191
<font color="yellow">and I'm the murderer.</font>
