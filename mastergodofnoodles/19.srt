00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,220
<font color="yellow">Did you know?</font>

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,780
<font color="yellow">I also started politics with a vacant spot.</font>

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,950
<font color="yellow">Gil Do.</font>

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,880
<font color="yellow">Stop living like a beast as of today.</font>

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,950
<font color="yellow">If you keep living like one, I'll destroy you.</font>

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,220
<font color="yellow">I asked if I could take the spot.</font>

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,950
<font color="yellow">Sure, go ahead.</font>

15
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,580
<font color="yellow">How will I stop a beast like you?</font>

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
<font color="yellow">What is your name?</font>

17
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,980
<font color="yellow">Hwang Sung Rok.</font>

18
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,590
<font color="yellow">For which crime of his will you be witnessing?</font>

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,320
<font color="yellow">Two cases of murder instigations,</font>

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,050
<font color="yellow">numbers of embezzlement, breach of duties,</font>

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,220
<font color="yellow">fabrication of the official documents,</font>

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,820
<font color="yellow">assault, threat and much more.</font>

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,520
<font color="yellow">I will witness on all of these.</font>

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,950
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,550
<font color="yellow">Please spare me.</font>

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,250
<font color="yellow">- Please.
-  Go apologise to Mr Ha.</font>

27
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,850
<font color="yellow">No matter how much you beg, there's nothing I can do.</font>

28
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,220
<font color="yellow">You can't kill a person.</font>

29
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,450
<font color="yellow">But if you send me to Mr Ha,</font>

30
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,280
<font color="yellow">it'll be the same thing as you killing me.</font>

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
<font color="yellow">What would be the difference?</font>

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,610
<font color="yellow">Shut his mouth.</font>

33
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,850
<font color="yellow">Kim Da Hae! Kim Da Hae!</font>

34
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,250
<font color="yellow">Let him talk.</font>

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,520
<font color="yellow">Why did you just say Da Hae's name?</font>

36
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,720
<font color="yellow">What do you think will happen if Congressman So...</font>

37
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,480
<font color="yellow">finds out that Kim Da Hae is Mr Ha's daughter?</font>

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,280
<font color="yellow">Do you think he will keep her alive?</font>

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,230
<font color="yellow">How would So Tae Seop know about that?</font>

40
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,750
<font color="yellow">I set things up so that...</font>

41
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,280
<font color="yellow">everything will be revealed as soon as I die.</font>

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,520
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to believe your lie?</font>

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,780
<font color="yellow">Whether you believe me or not...</font>

44
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,720
<font color="yellow">is up to you.</font>

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,750
<font color="yellow">But if what I said is true,</font>

46
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,150
<font color="yellow">Kim Da Hae will die.</font>

47
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,650
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha.</font>

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
<font color="yellow">It's not...</font>

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,450
<font color="yellow">over yet.</font>

50
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,480
<font color="yellow">Something doesn't feel right.</font>

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,520
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

52
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,690
<font color="yellow">Nothing will happen, right?</font>

53
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,450
<font color="yellow">Stop imagining stuff. Everything will be fine.</font>

54
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,150
<font color="yellow">Then I'm going to take my hands off now.</font>

55
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,680
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

56
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,380
<font color="yellow">From instigation of murder to money laundering.</font>

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,850
<font color="yellow">I can be a witness to everything.</font>

58
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,450
<font color="yellow">Of course,</font>

59
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,020
<font color="yellow">I have relevant evidence.</font>

60
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,680
<font color="yellow">Tell me your conditions.</font>

61
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,720
<font color="yellow">You're smart.</font>

62
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,150
<font color="yellow">Dokku...</font>

63
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,420
<font color="yellow">I mean, Lee Jeong Beom.</font>

64
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,820
<font color="yellow">You dropped his charges.</font>

65
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,050
<font color="yellow">That's why I surfaced.</font>

66
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,450
<font color="yellow">I want full immunity...</font>

67
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,280
<font color="yellow">on everything I did in the past.</font>

68
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,150
<font color="yellow">Then I'll give you a statement.</font>

69
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,880
<font color="yellow">I once sent a parcel to Ms Ko Gang Sook.</font>

70
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,150
<font color="yellow">She didn't use it wisely.</font>

71
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,520
<font color="yellow">I hope...</font>

72
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,450
<font color="yellow">you don't make the same mistake.</font>

73
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,080
<font color="yellow">I need time to think.</font>

74
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,180
<font color="yellow">Take all the time you need.</font>

75
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,950
<font color="yellow">But I'd rather you not take too long.</font>

76
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,880
<font color="yellow">Where's Congressman Choi?</font>

77
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,630
<font color="yellow">I haven't been able to reach him for three days.</font>

78
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,480
<font color="yellow">He hasn't shown up in Congress...</font>

79
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,720
<font color="yellow">or at his office.</font>

80
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,580
<font color="yellow">I can't tell if he disappeared or if he's missing.</font>

81
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,410
<font color="yellow">His aides also seem to be wary.</font>

82
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,520
<font color="yellow">He must have gone into hiding.</font>

83
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,620
<font color="yellow">Too bad we can't arrest congressmen during congress.</font>

84
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,050
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

85
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,950
<font color="yellow">There's something you must see.</font>

86
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,830
<font color="yellow">Based on trace evidence of burned charcoal...</font>

87
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,630
<font color="yellow">and statements from family that he'd been under stress,</font>

88
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,180
<font color="yellow">the police suspect the congressman took his own life.</font>

89
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,640
<font color="yellow">A source close to Choi said his aide...</font>

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,450
<font color="yellow">was jailed for violating foreign exchange laws...</font>

91
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,640
<font color="yellow">and that the prosecutors were closing in on him.</font>

92
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,810
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Chief.
-  They say this could've...</font>

93
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,240
<font color="yellow">had an effect on his suicide.</font>

94
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,450
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

95
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,270
<font color="yellow">Choi Sung Do was So Tae Seop's right-hand man...</font>

96
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,570
<font color="yellow">who had secured his third consecutive term...</font>

97
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,080
<font color="yellow">with a huge margin in the previous election.</font>

98
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,610
<font color="yellow">This incident means a by-election must be held...</font>

99
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,620
<font color="yellow">in Choi's constituency.</font>

100
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,680
<font color="yellow">He wasn't my right-hand man.</font>

101
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,080
<font color="yellow">You can't ignore the importance of experience.</font>

102
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,960
<font color="yellow">It's only hard the fist time.</font>

103
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,650
<font color="yellow">It becomes familiar the second time.</font>

104
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,480
<font color="yellow">It's nothing the third time.</font>

105
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,320
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd clean it up so nicely.</font>

106
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,180
<font color="yellow">You'll be nominated immediately.</font>

107
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,480
<font color="yellow">A lot of people are watching.</font>

108
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,850
<font color="yellow">Lie low for now,</font>

109
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,620
<font color="yellow">and prepare to be elected.</font>

110
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I'd need something...</font>

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,020
<font color="yellow">to prepare myself with?</font>

112
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,750
<font color="yellow">My money and gold bars. You took them all.</font>

113
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,880
<font color="yellow">Give me back...</font>

114
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,680
<font color="yellow">what you haven't spent.</font>

115
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,480
<font color="yellow">Right now.</font>

116
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,420
<font color="yellow">That way, I can prepare.</font>

117
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,290
<font color="yellow">You really don't know when to stop, do you?</font>

118
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,080
<font color="yellow">You and I are in the same boat now.</font>

119
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,820
<font color="yellow">We will either both live or both die.</font>

120
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,880
<font color="yellow">I would rather we both live...</font>

121
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,880
<font color="yellow">for a long, long time.</font>

122
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,720
<font color="yellow">Bring me the original of the confidential document.</font>

123
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,820
<font color="yellow">Then I will give you what I have.</font>

124
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,920
<font color="yellow">I will think about it...</font>

125
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,120
<font color="yellow">once I join Congress.</font>

126
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,490
<font color="yellow">If you get it before then,</font>

127
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,150
<font color="yellow">you'll chew me right up.</font>

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,880
<font color="yellow">Why should I fill your greedy belly?</font>

129
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,980
<font color="yellow">You already ate so much that...</font>

130
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,850
<font color="yellow">you're full right up to your throat.</font>

131
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,350
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

132
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,320
<font color="yellow">Do as you're told.</font>

133
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,240
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who decides.</font>

134
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,450
<font color="yellow">Please give it another thought.</font>

135
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,120
<font color="yellow">Do me a favour.</font>

136
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
<font color="yellow">Mr Ha.</font>

137
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,180
<font color="yellow">Stop him from doing anything bad.</font>

138
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,800
<font color="yellow">Focus.</font>

139
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,820
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

140
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
<font color="yellow">Mr Park.</font>

141
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,380
<font color="yellow">Do you want to study?</font>

142
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

143
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,720
<font color="yellow">Night schools or online degrees.</font>

144
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,180
<font color="yellow">You can study on the clock.</font>

145
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,820
<font color="yellow">I'll make you my aide once I win the election.</font>

146
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,980
<font color="yellow">Be prepared.</font>

147
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,350
<font color="yellow">Are you listening?</font>

148
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

149
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

150
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,720
<font color="yellow">You got ordered to stop investigating.</font>

151
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,780
<font color="yellow">I will be transferred soon.</font>

152
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,090
<font color="yellow">It'll be settled as soon as they find my replacement.</font>

153
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,420
<font color="yellow">A criminal case that involves politics...</font>

154
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,620
<font color="yellow">always gets messy like this.</font>

155
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,560
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It's my fault.</font>

156
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,250
<font color="yellow">You're right. It's all your fault.</font>

157
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,020
<font color="yellow">I worked so hard just to get here,</font>

158
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,250
<font color="yellow">and you ruined it all with one case.</font>

159
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,850
<font color="yellow">So get rid of Mr Ha once and for all.</font>

160
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

161
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,920
<font color="yellow">Cards are scary whey they haven't been shown yet.</font>

162
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,050
<font color="yellow">Do you watch football?</font>

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,990
<font color="yellow">Before the referee brings out a card,</font>

164
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,980
<font color="yellow">the player will plead to stay in the game.</font>

165
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,320
<font color="yellow">But once the red card comes out,</font>

166
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,320
<font color="yellow">they curse as they walk off.</font>

167
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,750
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

168
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,150
<font color="yellow">What's there to fear when they're out anyway?</font>

169
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,680
<font color="yellow">That's me right now.</font>

170
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,750
<font color="yellow">Sort it out fast.</font>

171
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,520
<font color="yellow">You have until they find my replacement.</font>

172
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,350
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Sir.</font>

173
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,450
<font color="yellow">I'm closer to injustice than justice,</font>

174
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,220
<font color="yellow">and I value personal revenge over public order.</font>

175
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,220
<font color="yellow">So don't thank me.</font>

176
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,320
<font color="yellow">Then why...</font>

177
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,780
<font color="yellow">Try getting bibim guksu all over your face.</font>

178
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,620
<font color="yellow">Then you'll understand why.</font>

179
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,820
<font color="yellow">How do you like your job?</font>

180
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,450
<font color="yellow">It's not bad.</font>

181
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,150
<font color="yellow">I got fired after just three years.</font>

182
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,960
<font color="yellow">Why is my face up there?</font>

183
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,400
<font color="yellow">But still, you're the one...</font>

184
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,410
<font color="yellow">who made Goongnakwon into what it is now.</font>

185
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,620
<font color="yellow">I don't want to leave any trace of me here.</font>

186
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,650
<font color="yellow">Take it down.</font>

187
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

188
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,420
<font color="yellow">- Right now.
-  Sir.</font>

189
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
<font color="yellow">Do it.</font>

190
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,450
<font color="yellow">Wait. Let me do it.</font>

191
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,280
<font color="yellow">I'm slightly taller than you are.</font>

192
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,750
<font color="yellow">Your name is...</font>

193
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,350
<font color="yellow">Gil Yong, isn't it?</font>

194
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir. I'm Ko Gil Yong, the dishwasher.</font>

195
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,450
<font color="yellow">Take it down, and put it at the annex.</font>

196
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

197
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,830
<font color="yellow">This cuts years off my life.</font>

198
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,440
<font color="yellow">I thought it would stay up there for decades.</font>

199
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,620
<font color="yellow">Why does he want it gone already?</font>

200
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,480
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

201
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,650
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

202
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,980
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, so don't bother.</font>

203

<font color="yellow">Who gave you this?</font>

205
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,580
<font color="yellow">Don't ask. Give it back.</font>

206
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,780
<font color="yellow">Was it Yeo Kyung?</font>

207
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

208
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,620
<font color="yellow">I'll keep it.</font>

209
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,280
<font color="yellow">You can't leave it around.</font>

210
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,380
<font color="yellow">I never left it lying around.</font>

211
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,390
<font color="yellow">I tore my hair out trying to find the safest spot.</font>

212
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,980
<font color="yellow">And I gave Yeo Kyung my word...</font>

213
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,160
<font color="yellow">that I'd keep it safe.</font>

214
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,780
<font color="yellow">I can keep it safer.</font>

215
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,950
<font color="yellow">How can I trust you?</font>

216
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,370
<font color="yellow">You work for Mr Ha.</font>

217
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,080
<font color="yellow">What if you give it to him?</font>

218
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
<font color="yellow">Gil Yong.</font>

219
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,520
<font color="yellow">I don't know what this is, and I don't want to know.</font>

220
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,620
<font color="yellow">But I know that this is very important to Yeo Kyung...</font>

221
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,720
<font color="yellow">and that I must keep it safe no matter what.</font>

222
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,890
<font color="yellow">So stay away.</font>

223
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,080
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

224
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,680
<font color="yellow">Whoever has this becomes a target.</font>

225
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,250
<font color="yellow">They could end up dead.</font>

226
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,380
<font color="yellow">No. They will die.</font>

227
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,740
<font color="yellow">If you have it, you'll die.</font>

228
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,450
<font color="yellow">If Yeo Kyung has it, she will.</font>

229
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,580
<font color="yellow">What if you have it?</font>

230
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,280
<font color="yellow">Hi, Yeo Kyung.</font>

231
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,320
<font color="yellow">Of course it's safe.</font>

232
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,420
<font color="yellow">Now?</font>

233
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,280
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

234
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,550
<font color="yellow">She wants to see us.</font>

235
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,380
<font color="yellow">All of us.</font>

236
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,050
<font color="yellow">Congressman Choi killed himself?</font>

237
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,180
<font color="yellow">That would never happen.</font>

238
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,450
<font color="yellow">Cockroaches never commit suicide.</font>

239
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,750
<font color="yellow">Kim Gil Do has to be involved.</font>

240
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,880
<font color="yellow">No. Is it both So Tae Seop and Kim Gil Do?</font>

241
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,280
<font color="yellow">The man who made Tae Ha's father a murderer...</font>

242
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,850
<font color="yellow">is Kim Gil Do.</font>

243
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,220
<font color="yellow">We can put pressure on him with the secret document.</font>

244
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,520
<font color="yellow">If it goes to Congressman So,</font>

245
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,000
<font color="yellow">he'll no longer need Kim Gil Do.</font>

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,080
<font color="yellow">But that means we have no way of convicting him.</font>

247
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,440
<font color="yellow">If Congressman So gets it,</font>

248
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,120
<font color="yellow">he'll try to cover his tracks.</font>

249
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,620
<font color="yellow">That includes Yeo Kyung.</font>

250
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,980
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, I'm still a prosecutor.</font>

251
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,950
<font color="yellow">He can't do anything to me yet.</font>

252
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,730
<font color="yellow">I'll offer a deal.</font>

253
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,250
<font color="yellow">It's too dangerous.</font>

254
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,320
<font color="yellow">Let's summarise.</font>

255
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,340
<font color="yellow">We make a deal with So Tae Seop before Myeong's show.</font>

256
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,800
<font color="yellow">We'll arrest Kim Gil Do after the TV show,</font>

257
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,150
<font color="yellow">and then see to it that he rots in jail.</font>

258
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, let's do that.</font>

259
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,380
<font color="yellow">Until now,</font>

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,150
<font color="yellow">we fought the same enemy separately.</font>

261
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,080
<font color="yellow">In our bids to keep the others safe,</font>

262
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,980
<font color="yellow">we fought separately from the inside and out.</font>

263
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,150
<font color="yellow">Let's stop doing that.</font>

264
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,620
<font color="yellow">Do you want some noodles?</font>

00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,790

268
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,150
<font color="yellow">They treat you worse than a useless old man.</font>

269
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,050
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

270
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,050
<font color="yellow">Now that you got the nomination, we should get to work.</font>

271
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,380
<font color="yellow">You can find an office and hire the campaigners.</font>

272
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,750
<font color="yellow">That's nothing.</font>

273
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,920
<font color="yellow">Why don't we do a live show?</font>

274
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,220
<font color="yellow">Let's not waste your last TV appearance.</font>

275
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,650
<font color="yellow">We can bring a panel on board...</font>

<font color="yellow">and let the public join in live.</font>

277

<font color="yellow">Korea's first ever live cooking show...</font>

278
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,320
<font color="yellow">should create quite a buzz.</font>

279
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,380

280

282
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,680
<font color="yellow">You must be good at pretending.</font>

283
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,180

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,750
<font color="yellow">it would be better to entrust someone with my shares.</font>

315
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,340
<font color="yellow">Just keep it instead of causing us more trouble.</font>

316
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,750
<font color="yellow">He wants to erase Goongnakwon from his identity...</font>

317
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,500
<font color="yellow">at least until the election is over.</font>

318
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,780
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't do that. Goongnakwon is my root.</font>

319
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,450
<font color="yellow">We'll see about that.</font>

320
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,070
<font color="yellow">Let's see what happens after you transfer your shares.</font>

321
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,170
<font color="yellow">Don't be too afraid. I won't bite.</font>

322
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,180
<font color="yellow">We can't stop him from exercising his rights.</font>

323
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,620
<font color="yellow">Let's hear who you'll entrust them to.</font>

324
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,850
<font color="yellow">Ms Seol, I hope you'll run Goongnakwon well.</font>

325
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,050
<font color="yellow">This is unexpected.</font>

326
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,120
<font color="yellow">Why did you choose me?</font>

327
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,450
<font color="yellow">You are the only person here that I can trust.</font>

328
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
<font color="yellow">Now that you have a share of 40 percent,</font>

329
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,660
<font color="yellow">if Top Head of Noodles wavers, teach him well...</font>

330
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,120
<font color="yellow">until I return.</font>

331
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,720
<font color="yellow">Then I won't wait to say this.</font>

332
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,650
<font color="yellow">Here's what I think.</font>

333
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,150
<font color="yellow">I cannot...</font>

334
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,020
<font color="yellow">accept you as Mr Ha's successor.</font>

335
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,520
<font color="yellow">There are rumours that you can't properly taste food.</font>

336
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,550
<font color="yellow">That's impossible. Don't say such nonsense.</font>

337
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,320
<font color="yellow">He cooked royal pheasant buckwheat noodles perfectly.</font>

338
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,580
<font color="yellow">Don't get so upset. He just has to prove me wrong.</font>

339
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,450
<font color="yellow">Isn't this show going to be live?</font>

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

341
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,620
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to cook royal pheasant buckwheat noodles.</font>

342
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,720
<font color="yellow">Prove yourself without any editing or tricks.</font>

343
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,220
<font color="yellow">Then I'll believe you.</font>

344
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,180
<font color="yellow">Very well.</font>

345
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,850
<font color="yellow">But if I do prove myself on live TV,</font>

346
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,050
<font color="yellow">accept me as Master of Noodles.</font>

347
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,480

<font color="yellow">I can...</font>

391

<font color="yellow">I have a witness to accuse Kim Gil Do.</font>

398

400
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,020
<font color="yellow">Are you listening to me?</font>

401
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,150
<font color="yellow">You guys are too ignorant about the world.</font>

402

<font color="yellow">But do you know what's funny?</font>

403
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,680
<font color="yellow">That is what scares me about you guys.</font>

404
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,820
<font color="yellow">Did you just say "you guys"?</font>

405

<font color="yellow">Try to catch Kim Gil Do.</font>

406
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,880
<font color="yellow">This is your last chance.</font>

407
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,650
<font color="yellow">You may go now.</font>

408
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,950
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

409
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,820
<font color="yellow">How did it go? What about Yeo Kyung?</font>

410
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,480
<font color="yellow">Did you do something wrong?</font>

411
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,250
<font color="yellow">I took care of it.</font>

412
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,140
<font color="yellow">Yeo Kyung will be fine.</font>

413
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,250
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

414
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,830
<font color="yellow">Can I trust you?</font>

415
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,850
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

416
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,320
<font color="yellow">Just make sure to keep it to yourself.</font>

417
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

418
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,350
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

419
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,820
<font color="yellow">Do you have time right now?</font>

420
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,150
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

421
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,540
<font color="yellow">I'm off now, though.</font>

422
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,920
<font color="yellow">I'll see you in the parking lot.</font>

423
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,590
<font color="yellow">Hey, I said I wasn't sure. Don't you get it?</font>

424
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,280
<font color="yellow">It could mean that I don't have time.</font>

425
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,880
<font color="yellow">But the probability is that you'll end up dead.</font>

427

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,750
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

429
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,980
<font color="yellow">Am I your boss or what?</font>

430
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,080
<font color="yellow">That's okay.</font>

431
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,320
<font color="yellow">Where are we going anyway?</font>

432
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,320
<font color="yellow">You'll see.</font>

433
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,480
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating?</font>

434
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,020
<font color="yellow">Now I believe that...</font>

435
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,720
<font color="yellow">you've never gone out with a girl.</font>

436
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,070
<font color="yellow">What does that have to do with dumplings?</font>

437
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,680
<font color="yellow">Forget about it.</font>

438
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,220
<font color="yellow">It is delicious.</font>

439
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
<font color="yellow">I ate...</font>

440
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,620
<font color="yellow">dumplings with Mr Ha a while back.</font>

441
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,980
<font color="yellow">That was the day...</font>

442
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,350
<font color="yellow">I saw you at the charnel house.</font>

443
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,720
<font color="yellow">I found out...</font>

444
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,750
<font color="yellow">you were his daughter that day.</font>

445
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,150
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk about it.</font>

446
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,720
<font color="yellow">My father was a murderer.</font>

447
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,820
<font color="yellow">He killed two people.</font>

448
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,750
<font color="yellow">Then he was executed.</font>

449
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,750
<font color="yellow">I'm a son of a murderer with bad blood.</font>

450
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,250
<font color="yellow">I wanted to escape from that fact.</font>

451
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,720
<font color="yellow">So I ran away desperately.</font>

452
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,150
<font color="yellow">And now I'm here.</font>

453
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,950
<font color="yellow">I don't want to run away any more.</font>

454
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,720
<font color="yellow">And I don't want you to run away, either.</font>

455
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,750
<font color="yellow">No matter who your father is...</font>

456
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,650
<font color="yellow">or what he does,</font>

457
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,350
<font color="yellow">it is not your fault.</font>

458
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,820
<font color="yellow">Just endure it from where you stand.</font>

459
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,450
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you this.</font>

460
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,750
<font color="yellow">What if I still run away?</font>

461
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,720
<font color="yellow">Hold onto me so I won't.</font>

462
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,520
<font color="yellow">I had a good time.</font>

463
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,680
<font color="yellow">Do you know what you smell of?</font>

464
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,720
<font color="yellow">You smell of sweat, car...</font>

465
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,320
<font color="yellow">and...</font>

466
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,480
<font color="yellow">dumplings.</font>

467
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>
