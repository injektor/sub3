00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,230
(Episode 13)

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Look.

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,200
How many are there? Count them.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,460
There are 46 crocks in total.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,700
People get wrinkles as they grow old,

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,330
and trees get growth rings.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,730
Right?

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,930
These crocks are like my wrinkles and growth rings.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,900
With 46 crocks, I'd say you're still young.

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,660
Jung Tae.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,010
Yes?

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,160
You can use these as a stepping stone...

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,400
to make them into 200 crocks. Okay?

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,730
The base of all dishes is the sauce.

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,360
You need a good sauce to make a good noodle dish.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,200
Whatever happens,

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,660
don't ever forget this, okay?

20
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,660
Of course. I will keep that in mind.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,840
Look at you. You're now part of the family.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,860
Don't you think?

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,200
That stupid old man.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
He shouldn't have done such a thing.

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,400
What are you thinking about?

26
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,130
About your father.

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,530
That's weird.

28
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,000
You say that you're thinking about my father,

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,900
but it sounds creepy.

30
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,500
Gil Do.

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,300
That's enough.

32
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,330
Did you...

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,260
just call me Gil Do?

34
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,600
Why do you call me Kim Gil Do?

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,460
The person who made that small Chimyeon Restaurant...

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,840
into the grand Goongnakwon in Gangnam is Ha Jung Tae.

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,830
The person who turned you into the master of...

38
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,400
royal pheasant buckwheat noodles is also Ha Jung Tae.

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,760
And the person who worked around the clock...

40
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,000
being held in contempt by the Ko Family is also Ha Jung Tae.

41
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,930
But why do you call me Kim Gil Do?

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,060
Why is that?

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,260
Why?

44
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,230
Kim Gil Do...

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,600
is a murderer.

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,530
I'm not the only one who killed someone.

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
You killed the only person I've ever loved.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,130
Did I startle you?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,430
I have more.

50
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,230
The daughter of the woman you killed...

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,660
Do you know who that is?

52
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,700
She's Da Hae.

53
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,860
Stop... Stop lying.

54
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,660
That's... That's a lie.

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,030
Do you know why I've kept you alive?

56
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,430
If you die now,

57
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,400
your daughter, Gang Sook, will get all your shares.

58
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,660
Goongnakwon...

59
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,960
is mine.

60
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,900
I sacrificed my life on building it into what it is now.

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,860
No one can touch it.

62
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,730
If you do,

63
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,630
both you and your daughter, Gang Sook,

64
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,400
won't be able to get away with it.

65
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,170
So let's make a deal.

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,730
Hand your shares over to me.

67
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,700
And all you have to do is to...

68
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,500
just keep breathing as if your neither dead nor alive.

69
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,030
Anything other than that is unacceptable.

70
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,360
Kim... Kim Gil Do.

71
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,930
You.

72
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,170
(Thief and murderer wanted, 3,000-dollar reward)

73
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,130
Is this the man I'm thinking about?

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,030
Who else knows about this?

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,530
Now you know about it.

76
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,630
Why are you...

77
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,930
telling me about this?

78
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,930
You deserve to know...

79
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,660
if the person next to you is a human or a beast.

80
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,360
Leave it here.

81
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,660
If you overlook it, I will expose it to the world myself.

82
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,780
He is a murderer.

83
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,060
Stop it!

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,530
Sir, are you all right?

85
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,000
Sir.

86
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,660
Was Mr Ha here?

87
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,500
I can smell the wolfsbane powder. He was here, wasn't he?

88
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,230
What did he do to you?

89
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,400
Da Hae.

90
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,130
Yes, Sir. I'm listening.

91
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,300
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,700
I'm...

93
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
really sorry.

94
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,830
Yes?

95
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,130
Did you check the composite sketch?

96
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,110
The case is from 34 years ago.

97
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,100
And the statute of limitations has expired twice already.

98
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,100
Isn't it just a common murder case by a robber?

99
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,900
The address of the incident is 387-18, Seongbuk-dong.

100
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,940
The owner of the house hasn't changed for the past 34 years.

101
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,300
Do you know who the owner is?

102
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,100
It's Congressman So Tae Seop.

103
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,310
Are you sure?

104
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,430
Yes, I am.

105
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Okay.

106
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,160
Come back to the office.

107
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,740
What is this?

108
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,960
It's obviously the skill of making a request.

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,360
Explain it so that I can understand.

110
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,740
People of the highest ranks like him never assign you to a case.

111
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,200
That could get them into trouble later on.

112
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,570
If he wants you to scratch his back, he'll let you scratch his leg first.

113
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,270
Then you will end up scratching his back some day.

114
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,710
So that's why he trying to get me involved in the case?

115
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,710
You had dinner with him.

116
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,800
He wants you to pay for it.

117
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,930
(Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung)

118
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,770
Excuse me.

119
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,600
It's me.

120
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,980
The murder case of Seongbuk-dong took place in your house.

121
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,200
Your housekeeper was murdered, and Kim Gil Do is the murderer.

122
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,230
That's right.

123
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,330
Did you want me to investigate the case for your personal grudge?

124
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,940
The case has expired already.

125
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,110
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,110
What does Kim Gil Do...

127
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,800
have to do with Ha Jung Tae of Goongnakwon?

128
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,110
They have something in common.

129
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,060
You should get to the bottom of the case before making a snap decision.

130
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,930
Hello? Sir?

131
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,300
Where have you been?

132
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,040
I had something to take care of.

133
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
- I see.
 -  Let's go in.

134
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,500
Okay.

135
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,960
Instead of milk vetch root, add mountain ash.

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,530
To that, add white tuckahoe.

137
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,300
That will counter the bitter taste of camphor.

138
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,200
It's a secret recipe that only I know.

139
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,160
It cannot get out.

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,280
I apologise. It was an urgent call.

141
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,030
You're a busy man. Can you spare the time?

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,630
You're sweating.

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,660
Do you feel unwell?

144
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,460
No. I feel fine.

145
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,060
A bamboo leaf?

146
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,040
Okay.

147
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,130
Let's eat.

148
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,100
What a lovely combination of lilies and camphor.

149
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,660
You must know a lot about medicinal herbs.

150
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,260
I'm impressed.

151
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,400
Forget everything else. The noodles taste delicious.

152
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,270
I enjoyed it.

153
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,230
What did you think, Sir?

154
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,100
I felt like I was in a mountain surrounded by the scent of camphor.

155
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,330
Let's taste the next dish.

156
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,600
This is interesting.

157
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,310
It has a zing, but also a nice flavour.

158
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,800
It's a great dish overall,

159
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,500
but the noodles could have been better.

160
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,400
I think you boiled the gardenia noodles first.

161
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,700
Unfortunately, they were a little soggy.

162
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,700
I agree with Ms Seol.

163
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,360
Let's read out the scores.

164
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,500
Before we do that,

165
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,030
I'd like to hear about how they made the broth.

166
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,410
It's getting late.

167
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,000
And Congressman So is busy. Let's make the decision.

168
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,060
I don't mind.

169
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,160
What do you think? Can you tell us the recipe?

170
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,900
Yes.

171
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,960
Then let's go with the five-coloured noodles first.

172
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,640
I used milk vetch root, acanthopanax, kudzu,

173
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,630
boxthorn, dates, silvervine fruit and...

174
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,130
wolfsbane powder.

175
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,990
Wolfsbane powder?

176
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,500
It was the poison given to people who deserved the death penalty.

177
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,130
A large enough dose can even kill an ox.

178
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,830
Did you poison our food?

179
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,730
If you wanted to kill us all,

180
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,700
you could have.

181
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,700
Wolfsbane can be a poison, but also a medicine.

182
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,530
It eliminates a herb's bad smell and improves the flavour.

183
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
It is also good for arthritis and diabetes.

184
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,030
That's why I used it.

185
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,730
Adding poison to food...

186
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,760
is something only a monster would do.

187
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,360
Myeong's not that kind of person.

188
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,530
We're all fine,

189
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,530
so let's consider this as a good experience.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,530
What goes in the broth of the lily and camphor noodles?

191
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,580
I added camphor, boxthorn, Korean angelica root,

192
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,460
liquorice root and milk vetch root.

193
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,130
That should have answered your questions. Now let's...

194
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,830
I don't smell milk vetch root.

195
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,670
They used mountain ash instead.

196
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,530
And white tuckahoe, too.

197
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,460
Da Hae.

198
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,260
You should learn when not to speak.

199
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,000
Wait. I remember...

200
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,940
- that recipe.
 -  Stop being obstinate.

201
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,230
Mountain ash and white tuckahoe are often used with camphor.

202
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,430
I'm pretty sure the deputy head was so focused that he forgot...

203
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,310
what he used. Am I right?

204
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,260
I'll ask the deputy head one last question.

205
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,730
Your honour is at stake, so please be honest.

206
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,610
Were you mistaken,

207
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,860
or did you not use mountain ash and white tuckahoe?

208
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,800
I...

209
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,600
did not use...

210
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,970
mountain ash and white tuckahoe.

211
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,730
Whatever the reason, I made a crucial mistake.

212
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,860
I will forfeit the challenge.

213
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,300
I apologise.

214
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,400
Ingredients he didn't even use...

215
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,930
ended up in the noodles.

216
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,130
The deputy head of noodles admitted his mistake.

217
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,360
It's time to decide.

218
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,400
He cheated.

219
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,430
Therefore, he loses...

220
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
the right to compete.

221
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,230
Our new head of noodles is Moo Myeong.

222
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,730
Thank you for your time.

223
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,330
Mr Ko Dae Cheon.

224
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,900
He is fully conscious.

225
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,600
I'm telling you since I thought everyone should know.

226
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,800
I told you that being hardheaded is not a compliment.

227
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,260
I will study harder so that being hardheaded...

228
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,730
becomes a compliment.

229
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,760
Thank you for everything.

230
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,930
Studying won't help you.

231
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,630
You've reached your maximum potential.

232
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,860
Your father-in-law is awake.

233
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,300
Shouldn't you go and see him?

234
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,430
You're my guest. I should see you out.

235
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,000
I didn't attend the competition to see Myeong.

236
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,730
I wanted to see your character.

237
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,630
But seeing...

238
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,130
how the competition went...

239
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,730
worries me a little.

240
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,060
I treat any bowl of noodles with utmost sincerity.

241
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,500
I did so far, and I will do so forever.

242
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,200
I hope you do.

243
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,230
By the way, do you hit balls?

244
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,290
If you're talking about golf, then yes. I play a little.

245
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,430
Let's play one day.

246
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,930
We can talk in the open.

247
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,840
Give me a call.

248
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,970
Goodbye then.

249
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,030
I don't believe it. Is he really conscious?

250
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,850
Am I dreaming?

251
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,390
He can't sit up yet. He can only speak.

252
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,160
He's weak in the body and mind. We'll have to wait and see.

253
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,500
Does that mean that...

254
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,350
we'll have to serve two bosses now?

255
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,600
What?

256
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,850
My goodness. One is more than enough.

257
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,450
How can we deal with two?

258
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,940
Can't they play rock-paper-scissors to decide?

259
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,300
Don't poke me.

260
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,990
Oh, my gosh. Mr Ha, I'm so sorry.

261
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,610
I ran off my mouth.

262
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,980
Why didn't you tell me he was here?

263
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,660
He has regained consciousness,

264
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,130
but he is extremely weak.

265
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,430
One positive aspect is that his cognitive ability is perfect.

266
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,860
Have a lawyer...

267
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,600
draw up papers to declare that he is fully competent.

268
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,970
Make sure he gets some rest.

269
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,380
You gathering around him like this could also be stressful for him.

270
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,360
Make sure visiting hours are strictly kept.

271
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,470
I should go.

272
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,900
Father.

273
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,000
Father.

274
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,160
It's me, Gang Sook.

275
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,170
Say something.

276
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,700
Why won't you even say your own daughter's name?

277
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,930
Father.

278
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,430
Gang Sook.

279
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,730
How have you been?

280
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,030
I've been miserable ever since your accident.

281
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,980
Mi Ja.

282
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,360
I'm right here.

283
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,360
Look after Gang Sook for me.

284
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,680
I will.

285
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,900
The kids from the kitchen.

286
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,200
Are they outside?

287
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,230
Yes.

288
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,700
I want to talk to them.

289
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,530
Send them in.

290
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,530
Come on in.

291
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,260
Mr Ko.

292
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,510
It's me, Kim Jin Young.

293
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,940
Do you recognise me?

294
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,960
You little brat.

295
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,510
You gained even more weight.

296
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm all skin and bones.

297
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,530
Don't say that.

298
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,640
Moon Bok.

299
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,760
Yes, Sir.

300
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,910
You've grown old, too.

301
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,800
I'm already 50.

302
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,500
Won Sang.

303
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,530
Do you still...

304
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,730
pretend to be dumb?

305
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,500
I'm a chatterbox now.

306
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,300
Cheo Nyeo.

307
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,310
Are you still not married?

308
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,070
If I did, I'd have to change my name, then.

309
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,250
Cheo Nyeo means "single".

310
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,580
Jin Hak.

311
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,650
Yes?

312
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,660
Do you...

313
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,310
still slack off at work?

314
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,260
I work hard now.

315
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,330
In the kitchen,

316
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,660
the head of noodles is always the boss.

317
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,200
Help him.

318
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,860
And have fun...

319
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,860
making noodles.

320
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,960
You don't make noodles...

321
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,030
with your hands.

322
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,200
Noodles...

323
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,900
are made with your soul.

324
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,640
Do you understand?

325
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,000
- Yes.
 -  Yes.

326
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,760
This is my will.

327
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,600
I woke up just so...

328
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,160
I could...

329
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,060
tell you that.

330
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,360
What did you do to Mr Ko?

331
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,780
What do you mean?

332
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,900
Wolfsbane.

333
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,200
I smelled it from day one.

334
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,500
I could smell it from Mr Ko's mouth and Dong Bae's hands.

335
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,300
It was an unfamiliar smell, so I thought it was medicine.

336
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,200
But earlier this evening, you reeked of the smell.

337
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,530
You fed it to Mr Ko.

338
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,040
That's why he was paralysed.

339
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,910
Because you can't let him wake up,

340
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,800
you drugged him so you could kill him.

341
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,300
To me,

342
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,800
Mr Ko...

343
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,330
was the father I never had.

344
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,900
I was a nobody.

345
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,030
But he let me work at Chimyeon Restaurant.

346
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,660
He made me his heir...

347
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,930
and let me marry his precious daughter.

348
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,530
Did you say...

349
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,760
I wanted to kill him?

350
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,130
Would I...

351
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,100
kill the only father I ever had?

352
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,530
Wolfsbane.

353
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,800
It's poison.

354
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,960
But it's also medicine.

355
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,880
It works wonders on people who suffer from a stroke.

356
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,900
That's why I gave it to him.

357
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,130
So he'd wake up.

358
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
So he'd...

359
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,700
knead dough again...

360
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
and make noodles again.

361
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,830
I want to be alone.

362
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,030
What an act that was.

363
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,430
I almost fell for it.

364
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,730
You left during the competition...

365
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,000
to see my father, right?

366
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,970
Did you go to feed him wolfsbane?

367
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,000
I just explained.

368
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,640
It's medicine.

369
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,930
He was paralysed and unable to speak until now.

370
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,830
It was because of the wolfsbane powder. It's no medicine.

371
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,160
You can't lie forever.

372
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,180
The truth will come out.

373
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,660
Don't waste your time here.

374
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,660
Spend what time you have with your father.

375
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,530
You might regret not doing so.

376
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,530
As of this moment,

377
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,430
don't you dare approach my father.

378
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,730
You put him in his current condition.

379
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,530
The least you can do is let him die in peace.

380
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,430
Okay?

381
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,930
Calm down.

382
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,760
I told you that...

383
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,960
you and I...

384
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,930
should tiptoe around each other.

385
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,100
That's best for us both.

386
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,160
Shut it.

387
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,900
Stay away from...

388
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,130
my father.

389
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,800
If you do,

390
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,360
I'll act my part and pretend to be...

391
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,460
a good wife.

392
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,960
(Born in 1966, Head of Dokku Gang)

393
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,430
(Gilsung Gang)

394
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,130
(Born in 1961, Seoul)

395
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,700
If I look into Kim Gil Do,

396
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,460
I'll get to Ha Jung Tae.

397
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,960
(Gangnam-gu San 323-37)

398
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,200
Ms Kim.

399
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Yes?

400
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,240
Gangnam-gu San 323-37.

401
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,810
Tell me the current address of that place.

402
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,530
It used to be a mountain.

403
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Ms Chae.

404
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,640
Gangnam-gu San 323-37 is currently part of Ilwon-dong.

405
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,600
Do you know what's there right now?

406
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,000
Goongnakwon.

407
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,860
Ha Jung Tae bought the land that used to be Kim Gil Do's house.

408
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,260
The land itself is registered under Goongnakwon.

409
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,410
But this red section.

410
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,900
This belongs to Ha Jung Tae.

411
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,160
He bought it 20 years ago.

412
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,130
Yes.

413
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,510
He planned to build Goongnakwon there since then.

414
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,800
He bought over 9000m² of land just so he could buy 65m²?

415
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,700
Why do you think he's so fixated on that land?

416
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,260
Ha Jung Tae and Kim Gil Do.

417
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,800
They're both the same person.

418
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,400
I am Moo Myeong, the new Head of Noodles.

419
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,500
I'm sure you were briefed on what happened.

420
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,530
Please continue to do your best at your work stations.

421
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,300
First, we need a deputy head of noodles.

422
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,700
Mr Park, the head of broth will fill in.

423
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,680
What? But I...

424
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,130
I need your help.

425
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,560
I don't think I deserve such respect from the head of noodles.

426
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,500
Well, I may not be good enough,

427
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,530
but I will make sure to try my best.

428
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,660
Good for you.

429
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,330
Mr Ko Dae Cheon said we should make noodles with our souls.

430
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,360
I will also try my best with a sincere heart...

431
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,630
to make noodles.

432
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Okay, then.

433
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,000
Let's start with three portions of royal pheasant buckwheat noodles.

434
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,210
Let's begin.

435
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,830
- Yes, Sir.
 -  Yes, Sir.

436
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,830
Mr Kim Jin Hak.

437
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,760
What you're doing will make the meat tougher.

438
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,060
Hit the body once and the legs twice.

439
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,800
I'm sorry, Sir.

440
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,030
I'm sorry about Deputy Head of Noodles.

441
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,800
But it is nobody's fault. Don't feel guilty about it.

442
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,200
I...

443
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,630
need your help.

444
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,800
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

445
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,530
Thank you, Sir.

446
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,330
Gil Yong.

447
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,060
You seem happy now that you've become the head of noodles.

448
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,830
Yeo Kyung is still investigating Goongnakwon.

449
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,160
- What?
 -  You said it was dangerous.

450
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,960
Shouldn't you stop her?

451
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,700
Father. Father.

452
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,960
Are you feeling better now?

453
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,770
Da Hae.

454
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,630
Gosh, you're saying her name again.

455
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,330
Why are you so obsessed with her?

456
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,930
Let me talk with you, too.

457
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,530
Father.

458
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,760
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

459
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,700
You should give me your shares for Goongnakwon.

460
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,500
If something goes wrong, Jung Tae will take over the restaurant. Okay?

461
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Father. Are you listening to me?

462
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,360
Ha Jung Tae...

463
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,060
is the one who made you this way. I will make him pay.

464
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,430
But I need power to do that.

465
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,060
Father.

466
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,800
Lawyer Park.

467
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,760
Bring him here.

468
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,330
Okay.

469
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,130
(Yeo Kyung)

470
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,690
You are the first one to come and the last one to leave.

471
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,760
When do you get to sleep?

472
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,300
We don't have a labourer any more. So I should do all the work.

473
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,000
We should hire a labourer.

474
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,930
I appreciate your hard work.

475
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,060
It's your day off tomorrow. What's your plan for tonight?

476
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,630
Well, nothing special.

477
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,430
I'd like to have a small celebration party. Will you join me?

478
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,300
Let me apologise first.

479
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,260
I'm sorry about yesterday.

480
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,530
Was it because of the wolfsbane powder?

481
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
I thought Mr Ko was in danger.

482
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,260
So...

483
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,700
It's okay. You prevented a big accident...

484
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,260
instead of helping me.

485
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,900
Where will you have the party?

486
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,160
At the fish noodle restaurant?

487
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,500
Where are you going?

488
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,160
Me? I have a plan.

489
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,630
Aren't you tired?

490
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,630
It's dangerous to ride a scooter at this hour.

491
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,630
Get in.

492
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,810
You go first. I will be right there.

493
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,200
There's plenty of seats here.

494
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,530
Do you want to join?

495
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,900
No, thank you.

496
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,300
What kind of music do you like?

497
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,010
Anything. What about you?

498
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,160
Me, too.

499
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:11,430
Do you remember? I was going to leave through the window.

500
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,060
How could I forget that? You also left your scooter here.

501
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,430
That's right. I did.

502
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,800
The police was here when I came back to get my scooter.

503
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,200
Your friend is just like you.

504
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,500
She is inflexible and stubborn.

505
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,700
My friend?

506
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,460
The female prosecutor. She also came to Goongnakwon once.

507
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
Didn't you see her?

508
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,870
What? She didn't even know your phone number.

509
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,630
Is she really your friend?

510
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,430
Yeo Kyung is still investigating Goongnakwon.

511
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,530
You said it was dangerous. Shouldn't you stop her?

512
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,060
Have some.

513
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,900
Wow.

514
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,500
It looks very delicious.

515
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,500
I don't need to worry about getting fat as it is devil's-tongue jelly.

516
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
What is that?

517
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,100
Gosh!

518
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,980
I've been looking for this.

519
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,530
Did you have it all this time?

520
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,190
You bought it, didn't you?

521
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,200
Smell it.

522
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,730
It's mine!

523
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,270
It's no fun to just drink.

524
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,130
Do you want to play Truth or Dare?

525
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,200
If you can't answer a question, you should drink.

526
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,870
Okay. But I will ask first.

527
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,430
Why...

528
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,730
did you join Goongnakwon?

529
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,500
Why did you join Goongnakwon?

530
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,030
How do you get into the secret room?

531
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,310
That's cheating. It's my turn to ask a question.

532
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,240
What was in the secret room other than a safe?

533
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,930
No, it's my turn.

534
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,960
Under Mr Ha's desk,

535
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,530
there is a button.

536
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,760
If you press it,

537
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,060
the wall rotates.

538
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,960
It rotates.

539
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,800
What did you do?

540
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,530
She got drunk on her own.

541
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,330
Don't imagine things.

542
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,830
Don't do this again.

543
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,730
Don't use innocent bystanders.

544
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,760
I didn't.

545
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Tae Ha.

546
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,660
What... What are you doing?

547
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,100
Stop it.

548
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,870
You smell nice.

549
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,960
Tae Ha's smell.

550
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,500
Why did you drink so much when you can't take it?

551
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,630
I can walk just fine.

552
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,010
Watch out.

553
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,130
Gosh.

554
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,700
I forgot. I should take a photo.

555
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,530
I have to take photos and report back.

556
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,530
Stop it.

557
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,300
Report to whom?

558
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,310
Hey.

559
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,400
Stop taking photos.

560
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,530
I like your smell.

561
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,500
I really do.

562
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,130
(Yeo Kyung)

563
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,900
Sorry for calling you out.

564
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,530
- Sit.
 -  No thanks.

565
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,500
I'm here to talk.

566
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,800
And then I'll leave.

567
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,500
I know that...

568
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,100
you're going after Mr Ha...

569
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,630
and that no one can stop you.

570
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,130
So I made up my mind.

571
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,400
I will stop worrying,

572
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,460
and I won't try to stop you.

573
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,330
- Yeo Kyung.
 -  Stop.

574
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,060
I'm not done talking.

575
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,760
Mr Ha was involved...

576
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,600
with my parents' death.

577
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,130
I will get to the truth.

578
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,460
You and I...

579
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,130
share a common enemy.

580
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,860
I'll get to the point. The only way...

581
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,100
to get you and Tae Ha out of Goongnakwon...

582
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,330
is to crush Mr Ha.

583
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,830
Let's join forces.

584
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,260
Let's crush that monster...

585
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,500
and go back to how we used to be.

586
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,500
Stay out of it.

587
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,510
I can do this alone.

588
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,000
With what power?

589
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,130
Can you ruin him...

590
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,130
by becoming the head of noodles?

591
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,160
I...

592
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,130
can't let you get hurt.

593
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,960
I can't even worry about you getting hurt.

594
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,630
So stay out of it.

595
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,330
That monster...

596
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,530
is out of your league.

597
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,630
Have you...

598
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,260
killed someone?

599
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,230
I have.

600
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,660
I killed a man...

601
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,600
and did nothing as Tae Ha took the blame.

602
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,730
I'm a murderer who goes around as a prosecutor with a clean past.

603
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,300
A monster?

604
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,530
Who's the real monster?

605
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,830
I am.

606
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:31,830
Can you say...

607
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,160
I'm not a monster?

608
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,460
Listen carefully.

609
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,030
Once this is over,

610
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,300
I will quit my job.

611
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:53,330
I will clear Tae Ha's name and pay for my crime. So please...

612
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,500
Please...

613
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,000
Please don't run away from me.

614
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,460
Let go of me.

615
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,300
Why do you think I ignored you?

616
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:41,660
It's because I knew you'd get involved.

617
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,330
That's why, Yeo Kyung.

618
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,800
That's why.

619
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,030
Let's do it together.

620
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,600
Let's stop...

621
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,830
running away.

622
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,700
Let's make something clear.

623
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,730
I take the lead. You stay behind me.

624
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,200
Don't do anything alone.

625
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,500
I won't work with you unless you promise me that.

626
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,500
I promise.

627
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,100
There's a secret room in Mr Ha's office.

628
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,930
He uses it to launder cash,

629
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,340
and I found a way to get in.

630
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,700
I'll go in soon.

631
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,000
Get me enough for a search warrant.

632
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,490
I need something concrete. Once we begin,

633
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,860
I'll go after Goongnak Foundation, too.

634
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,760
You should get back to work.

635
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,930
Look after yourself.

636
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,030
Mr Ha.

637
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,130
It's your big day.

638
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,460
Get on Congressman So's good side and fly high.

639
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,600
Take me with you if you can.

640
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,700
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung, was it?

641
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,330
Is she still on that case?

642
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,860
I tied her up for now.

643
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,000
She won't cause any trouble.

644
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,230
Good shot.

645
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,260
Do you work out?

646
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,300
Thank you, Sir.

647
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,330
Your ball goes way farther now.

648
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,800
You hit that too hard.

649
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,310
Prosecutor Ahn, can you go to the toilet?

650
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,880
What for? I just went.

651
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,900
Go again.

652
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,430
Sure.

653
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,160
Congressman Choi told me.

654
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,830
I'd like to invest.

655
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,630
If you take my money,

656
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,300
there's both a huge strength and a small problem.

657
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,030
No one can touch an investment that my money's in.

658
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,460
Isn't that a strength?

659
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,070
What's the small problem?

660
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,660
I heard it takes a year to launder money.

661
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,430
I'm too impatient to wait that long.

662
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,430
I want it back within three months.

663
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,660
That is the small problem.

664
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:20,120
Realistically speaking, that's impossible.

665
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,760
Make it possible.

666
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,700
The motto exists for a reason.

667
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,200
Let's go back to playing golf.

668
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,960
Isn't the weather lovely?

669
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,130
I, Ko Dae Cheon...

670
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,830
have in my name...

671
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,600
Did he make many changes?

672
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,200
It's practically a new will.

673
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,520
Did he mention me in...

674
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,830
I cannot answer any questions right now.

675
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,700
- Mr Park.
 -  I apologise.

676
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,900
I'm obligated to keep everything a secret.

677
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,730
Goodbye.

678
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,300
Mr Park.

679
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:42,830
Mr Ha.

680
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,260
Why are you here?

681
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,260
Mr Ko called me.

682
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,660
What for?

683
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,700
To write a new will.

684
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,320
I see.

685
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,000
Have a nice day.

686
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,760
You fool.

687
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,130
The mill goes round and round

688
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:54,430
And round and round

689
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,280
- Come with me.
 -  What for?

690
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,790
- I'm not done.
 -  You're so slow.

691
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,600
- We need to leave.
 -  You and your temper.

692
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,680
What are you doing?

693
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,900
You scared me. My goodness.

694
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,030
Are you all right?

695
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,260
Of course I am.

696
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,460
That's good.

697
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,330
I got a little too drunk last night.

698
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:31,460
I don't remember anything. Did something happen?

699
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:33,960
Not at all.

700
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,260
Of course not. Nothing could have.

701
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,380
Oh, Mr Ha wants to see you in half an hour at the annex.

702
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,830
Be there on time.

703
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,530
Mr Ha?

704
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,530
What for?

705
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,960
I don't know.

706
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,830
Bye.

707
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:28,530
Oh, dear.

708
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,930
Did I wake you?

709
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,260
Sorry.

710
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,660
I meant to come and go unnoticed.

711
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,730
What do you want?

712
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,000
I told you to make things right,

713
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,660
but you messed things up even further.

714
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,500
So this time,

715
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,830
I will make things right.

716
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,930
Wouldn't my shares...

717
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,420
naturally go to you?

718
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,600
Is that why you called your lawyer?

719
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,530
If you were going to leave the shares to me,

720
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,160
why did you meet Mr Park without me present?

721
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,460
Why did you?

722
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,360
Why...

723
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,300
Why is that in your hands?

724
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,230
I wonder. Why do you think I have this?

725
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,860
Now,

726
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,500
it will go to Da Hae.

727
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,530
She will be here soon.

728
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,200
You two can have a lovely chat.

729
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,800
Gil Do.

730
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,530
Kim Gil Do.

731
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,430
No.

732
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,230
This is wrong.

733
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,660
This...

734
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,830
Is there anyone out there?

735
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,800
Follow me.

736
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,030
Myeong, step back.

737
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,830
This is wrong.

738
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:07,450
This...

739
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,830
Mr Ko. Are you okay?

740
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,520
This is wrong.

741
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,720
Mr Ko. Mr Ko.

742
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,600
You can't...

743
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,930
What?

744
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,300
Why do you have this?

745
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,430
Is this yours?

746
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:31,400
I... I...

747
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,300
Did you kill my mother?

748
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:40,060
Tell me. Did you kill my mother?

749
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:49,630
Help! Can anyone help us?

750
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,270
Mr Ko. No.

751
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,760
Don't die. You can't die.

752
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,510
Sir!

753
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,140
Oh, no. Mr Ko!

754
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:03,160
Tell me. Tell me why you killed my mother!

755
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,360
I'm...

756
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,360
sorry.

757
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,930
Please don't die. Mr...

758
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,100
Mr Ko!

759
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,760
No.

760
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,830
You can't die.

761
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,660
(Master of Revenge)

762
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:03,430
Your father-in-law just passed away.

763
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,460
Thank you for letting me know by now.

764
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,300
Do you know how I became successful?

765
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,100
It's because I don't have friends.

766
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,800
Don't come in here ever again.

767
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,000
Mr Ha's shares have suddenly reached 50 percent.

768
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:20,900
I'd like to see Ha Jung Tae being suffocated.

769
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,350
That doesn't mean that I forgive you.

770
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:25,400
It still doesn't change the fact that you abandoned me.

771
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,730
Tell me. Why are you betraying me?
