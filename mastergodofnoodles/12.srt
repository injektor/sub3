3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,450
(Episode 12)

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,250
When you are faced with a monster,

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,850
you shouldn't express your true intentions.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,020
If you express your desire,

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,580
it will take advantage of your desire.

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,550
If you expose your weakness,

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,520
it will pounce on that weakness.

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,050
Take your time and don't throw yourself.

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,850
Hide and pretend not to know.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,550
You must hide your claws...

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,250
as if you've never met him before.

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,250
This is how monsters fight against each other.

15
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,780
This is how...

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
monsters fight...

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,320
against each other.

18
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,750
I asked for Mr Ha.

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,820
Who are you?

20
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm his personal assistant.

21
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,650
How can I help you?

22
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,930
I need to ask him a few questions for the investigation. It is simple.

23
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,500
He doesn't need to hide.

24
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,150
He is having an important meeting.

25
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,490
He isn't hiding.

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,560
Bring him here, right now.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,620
Do you have a warrant?

28
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,220
You can't meet him without a summons or an arrest warrant.

29
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,120
A request for him to accompany you will be rejected as well.

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,720
You should know that you are interrupting the business.

31
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,750
Please leave.

32
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,750
You said you found a job you liked.

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,880
You said...

34
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,250
you'd buy a heavy vehicle and operate it.

35
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,850
Is this why...

36
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,980
you told me to drop the case?

37
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,820
To work at Goongnakwon?

38
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,220
To become Mr Ha's personal assistant?

39
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,280
Is that why?

40
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,350
Tell me.

41
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,450
Why are you here?

42
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,350
You are the one who told me that he was a dangerous person.

43
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,820
- Yeo Kyung.
 -  Tae Ha.

44
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,920
What are you doing? Why are you lying?

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,450
Right now, you won't believe anything I say.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,720
There's a reason I had to work here.

47
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,030
And I can't leave now.

48
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,520
What is that reason?

49
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,950
Someone dragged you in here. Why can't you tell me?

50
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,220
You can't manage.

51
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,800
He's not someone you can take on alone.

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,060
Sometimes you have to fight, knowing you will lose.

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,820
You won't just lose. You could end up dead!

54
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,950
Thanks for the advice.

55
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,350
Don't come here again.

56
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,080
I don't want you to get hurt.

57
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Tae Ha.

58
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,980
You...

59
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,150
always did everything I asked.

60
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,880
Do me one last favour.

61
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,960
Quit working here.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,150
I didn't do anything for you.

63
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
It was the debt.

64
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,650
The debt I owed you for what my father did.

65
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,150
I think I paid it in full.

66
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,250
I guess you disagree.

67
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,580
Yes.

68
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,790
The debt.

69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
That debt.

70
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,820
It's still as huge as a mountain.

71
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,650
You aren't done paying me back.

72
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,750
Mr Ha got to where he is...

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
by committing crimes.

74
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,300
If you work for him, you'll have to do bad things.

75
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,520
I did nothing wrong.

76
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,750
You know that.

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Go.

78
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,020
Let's not meet like this again.

79
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,520
If you leave like this,

80
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,420
we're done being friends.

81
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,750
Skipping one meal...

82
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,650
is all it takes to feel hunger.

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
And air?

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,650
It's hard to last over a minute without it.

85
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,350
Friends?

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,350
I didn't see mine for six years,

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,820
and it wasn't too bad.

88
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,450
Friends...

89
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,150
mean less than you think.

90
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,750
Go.

91
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,520
Why did you want to see me so badly?

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,820
You move our country.

93
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,920
I've respected you for a while now.

94
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,950
Nonsense.

95
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,680
If our country was a plane,

96
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,050
I'm probably just one of those small screws.

97
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,680
Mr Ha.

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,280
You look familiar.

99
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,150
Have we met before?

100
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,130
This is our first meeting.

101
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,180
Is it?

102
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,580
I'm pretty sure I saw you somewhere.

103
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,750
I cannot beat around the bush.

104
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,330
People who wish to meet me...

105
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,180
all have a reason or a motive.

106
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,980
I only meet people who are worth my time.

107
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,450
I just...

108
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,850
wish to be of some help...

109
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,430
to the work you do and...

110
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,920
Do you know what the word "noodles" means?

111
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,680
It means "to absorb water".

112
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,720
Politics and noodles both have to retain water.

113
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,250
But...

114
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,250
can you do so with bare hands?

115
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,250
The water just drips through your fingers.

116
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,850
Even if it takes time,

117
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,180
you have to cup your hands to hold and move water.

118
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,280
Then, one day, you will be able to cook rice and noodles.

119
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,980
How touching.

120
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,890
I would love to quote it one day.

121
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,650
I feel hungry now.

122
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,300
Myeong, let's have some noodles.

123
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,390
What would you like?

124
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,980
This is a special day.

125
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,480
We should have janchi guksu.

126
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,390
I'll make some.

127
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,120
I enjoyed the meal.

128
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,950
I hope to see you more often.

129
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,750
I heard you're hosting a competition for Head of Noodles.

130
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,780
We'll meet then.

131
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,550
I'd like to see what the competition is like.

132
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,320
Do you mind?

133
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,620
You are welcome to come and watch.

134
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,250
But...

135
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,390
I'm only free the day after tomorrow.

136
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,200
That's too soon. We need time to prepare.

137
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,150
Haven't you ever taken a test?

138
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,350
Procrastination...

139
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,980
never works.

140
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,020
Your everyday skill is the real thing.

141
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,650
I don't mind.

142
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,390
I'm not sure if the deputy head of noodles will be okay, though.

143
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,300
We'll host it that evening, then.

144
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,920
Such an important event must be fair.

145
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,750
If you use tricks to pick your favourite...

146
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,250
or try to change the rules, it'll ruin your business.

147
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,080
Your job is to hold a competition where the two young men...

148
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,280
can show off their skills.

149
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,740
Of course, Sir.

150
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,750
I should leave.

151
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,700
See you in two days.

152
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,720
Go home safe, Sir.

153
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,730
I can't use tricks or change the rules...

154
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,020
of the competition.

155
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,890
It seemed like he was saying...

156
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,380
what you wanted to say to me.

157
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,150
I doubt that.

158
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,150
Why would he care for the likes of me?

159
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,080
I tried to make an ally and got a mother-in-law instead.

160
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,250
It's not the picture I imagined.

161
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,320
Erase it and start over.

162
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,050
Or paint over it.

163
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,620
You will be able to draw...

164
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,650
whatever it is you want.

165
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,680
Are you sure it's not the drawing you want?

166
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,420
Stand next to me.

167
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,680
Only my enemies stand before me.

168
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,350
Stand in my way,

169
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,680
and I might crush you without mercy.

170
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
You wouldn't.

171
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,580
I'm not foolish enough...

172
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,080
to take you on.

173
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,720
We shall wait and see about that.

174
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,420
We shall hold the competition tomorrow.

175
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,120
It will begin at 10pm, after business hours.

176
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,450
The judges will be me, Ms Seol and my wife.

177
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
It will be a blind test.

178
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,750
Name the dish.

179
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,280
You shall cook...

180
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,650
medicinal herb noodles.

181
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,260
You have to get rid of the offensive bitter taste,

182
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,650
but leave some flavour behind.

183
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,150
It's very hard to create a delectable dish.

184
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,820
If the broth, noodles and topping do not go perfectly well together,

185
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,980
it will be impossible to eat.

186
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,580
There is no definitive guideline,

187
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,620
which is why I thought this would be a perfect theme.

188
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,950
However, you must use at least five medicinal herbs.

189
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,220
You can each name one assistant.

190
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,950
I pick Kim Jin Hak.

191
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,280
I pick Kim Da Hae.

192
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,920
Speak up if you have objections or questions.

193
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,250
If not, you can leave.

194
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,760
Do you have more to say?

195
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,850
That's enough...

196
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,250
for me.

197
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,050
Now it just has to be fair.

198
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,980
Don't worry.

199
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,520
I will monitor everything from start to finish.

200
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,980
It will be very fair.

201
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,580
Mr Ha.

202
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,920
You look familiar.

203
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,420
Have we met before?

204
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,220
You can't go in. Who are you?

205
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,050
What is it?

206
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,350
Wait here.

207
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,320
I can't sleep out of fear that you'll hurt me.

208
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,250
What wouldn't a kidnapper do?

209
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,650
I mean nothing?

210
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
If you're a father... No.

211
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,420
If you're human,

212
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,920
you shouldn't have said that.

213
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,150
Don't worry.

214
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,680
I will monitor everything from start to finish.

215
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,360
- Ms Ko.
 -  Who are you?

216
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,250
I'm Mr Ha's assistant.

217
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,650
Oh, you're his new hire.

218
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,220
I don't have a title yet.

219
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,050
You're tall and handsome.

220
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,450
Don't be scared. I won't bite.

221
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,450
Is Mr Ha in?

222
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,010
No.

223
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,150
You're his assistant.

224
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,360
What are you doing here if he's not here?

225
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,850
He told me to wait here.

226
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,580
Okay, then.

227
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,220
Sorry.

228
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,350
What is it?

229
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,650
I'm here for my belongings.

230
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,060
I will get it for you.

231
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,580
Do you know what it looks like?

232
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,980
Step aside.

233
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,720
He opened his eyes? Are you sure?

234
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,320
Stay outside.

235
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,020
Are you going to follow me around like a puppy?

236
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,980
Don't mind me.

237
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,850
How odd.

238
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,750
You look like a rabbit, so why do you work for a snake?

239
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,760
Silly me. I'm so scatterbrained.

240
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,920
Where did I put it?

241
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,090
Sir, are you awake?

242
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,950
You should have given me a hint.

243
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,480
You scared me.

244
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,680
Who else knows?

245
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,090
Your daughter? Or Da Hae?

246
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,150
Tell me.

247
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,520
I heard you opened your eyes.

248
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,180
Why now?

249
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,450
You did this when we moved to Gangnam.

250
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,780
Why do you do this whenever I plan something?

251
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,190
Do you want me to fail that badly?

252
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,180
Do you? Is that it?

253
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,850
Open your eyes!

254
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,350
Why is there a remote control when there's no TV?

255
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,150
It's real.

256
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,280
Mr Ha.

257
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,450
What are you doing?

258
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,220
Can't you tell?

259
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,020
He's only skin and bones.

260
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,380
I massaged him, and that's all I felt.

261
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,650
What's this?

262
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,550
It looks like a bruise.

263
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,950
You strangled him.

264
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,260
I saw it with my own eyes.

265
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,400
What nonsense is this?

266
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,420
Nonsense?

267
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,090
It's not nonsense. You're feigning ignorance.

268
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,530
Do you call yourself human? What human being does this?

269
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,090
I've had enough.

270
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,990
You say what you want and blame me for everything.

271
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,220
Shut your mouth!

272
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,590
Wait.

273
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,850
What did you see?

274
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,320
I was here alone.

275
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,590
Father.

276
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,380
Father!

277
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,650
Father. Father.

278
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,850
Father.

279
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,380
Is he awake? Dae Cheon.

280
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,450
Dae Cheon.

281
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,320
How is he?

282
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,720
His consciousness comes and goes.

283
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,020
What if he never wakes up?

284
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,250
That won't happen.

285
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,550
He's a strong man. He will wake up.

286
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,980
It's almost a miracle that he regained consciousness.

287
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:03,050
But his vital signs aren't encouraging.

288
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,280
He is is under severe stress.

289
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,050
What's strange is that...

290
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,120
he shows symptoms of poison in his nervous system.

291
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,220
What do you mean?

292
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,380
He is severely paralysed.

293
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,520
Nothing showed up on the toxicology screen,

294
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,090
but he has been poisoned.

295
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Then...

296
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,350
what should we do?

297
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,320
Have him admitted.

298
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,950
Ms Ko.

299
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,520
I won't do that.

300
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,650
If he's admitted, I can't stay by his side.

301
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,750
If I'm not there,

302
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,520
he could die at any time.

303
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,180
Until he makes a full recovery,

304
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,180
I will eat and sleep here.

305
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,720
If that is what you wish, then I can't force you.

306
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,780
In case of possible emergencies,

307
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,980
I'll send someone over, so don't worry.

308
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,250
Goodbye.

309
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
Can you leave?

310
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,020
I want to talk to my dad.

311
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,780
Father.

312
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,580
I have evidence...

313
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,850
to crush Jung Tae.

314
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,350
He can't get away this time.

315
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,520
Burn it.

316
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,250
You know nothing.

317
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,380
You saw nothing. Do you understand?

318
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,820
Detective Park, it's me.

319
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,620
You need to come over.

320
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,980
It's not about the hit-and-run.

321
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,120
It's still urgent, though. See you soon.

322
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,420
Please stay here.

323
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,150
Okay.

324
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,720
Who told you to let her in?

325
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,520
No one is supposed enter my room without my permission.

326
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,780
Do I have to tell you that every time?

327
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,600
- I'm sorry, Sir.
 -  "I'm sorry."

328
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,680
"It is my fault."

329
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,150
I hate those words.

330
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,180
How many times did I tell you that?

331
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,180
I already watched what you did.

332
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,250
You can't erase my memory.

333
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,120
You look startled.

334
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,550
Of course.

335
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,780
You should be startled this time.

336
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,550
Don't you think?

337
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,820
What are you doing?

338
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,580
What do you think you are you doing?

339
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,850
- Honey.
 -  What?

340
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,480
Don't call me that.

341
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,120
I haven't heard that word in so long that I forgot.

342
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,980
Ha Jung Tae.

343
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,980
Do you know why I'm here?

344
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm here to kill you.

345
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,320
Detective Park.

346
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,210
What happens if someone installs...

347
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,890
a surveillance camera with no permission?

348
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,990
It is against the privacy protection law.

349
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,380
And if you violate the people's basic human rights,

350
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,690
you will receive a criminal penalty.

351
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,850
Take a look at this carefully.

352
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,380
Watch what he's done.

353
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,590
Did you do this?

354
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,850
If you are talking about channel management, yes.

355
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,850
You have a good assistant.

356
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,500
You changed it so soon.

357
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,850
Do you want us to investigate further into it?

358
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,550
Never mind.

359
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,320
I just became the crazy person.

360
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,320
Excuse me.

361
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,030
Earlier...

362
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,480
It was my mistake.

363
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,980
I would've been angry if I were you.

364
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,020
No one will enter this room without your permission from now on.

365
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,420
How did you change it?

366
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,720
I got a license for Engineer Information Communication in prison.

367
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,350
I didn't know I'd make use of it like this.

368
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Well done.

369
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,880
You may leave.

370
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Mr Park.

371
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,980
Spend all the money...

372
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,750
in this wallet within today.

373
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,380
- I'm sorry, Sir?
 -  Spend all the money inside.

374
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,580
There is no surveillance camera around Mr Choi's house.

375
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,350
There is one across the street, but it is broken.

376
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,380
He said he fell down the stairs.

377
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,820
According to the ambulance workers who'd gone there,

378
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,020
there was a lot of blood around this area.

379
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,220
Was there a black box?

380
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,350
There must've been cars that were parked around the area.

381
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,250
Ask the car owners for cooperation.

382
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,850
Okay.

383
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,850
Once a day, exactly five grams at a time.

384
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,120
Feed it to him after mixing it with water.

385
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,820
Don't use more or less of it.

386
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,580
Never eat it.

387
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,420
If you do, you won't feel anything even if your body burns in fire.

388
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,220
Hey, Gil Yong.

389
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,830
You're here.

390
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,940
Don't talk to me.

391
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,450
Ms Ko won't be happy if she finds out about this.

392
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,850
We share the same family name. I don't know why she's so mean to me.

393
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,360
Do you want a noodle expert to make you some noodles?

394
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,520
No, I'd have to get paid to eat your noodles.

395
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,880
Did you say, "noodle expert"?

396
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,520
Good for you!

397
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,650
Congratulations!

398
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,450
How dare you hug me?

399
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,400
I was just excited.

400
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,780
When you become Head of Noodles...

401
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,020
Go away.

402
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
I'm leaving.

403
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,250
Myeong?

404
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,080
You...

405
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,920
It's been a long time.

406
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,320
Why? You should try harder to hide from me.

407
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,760
You'll keep coming here to deliver vegetables anyway.

408
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,250
I was bound to see you some day.

409
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,050
If so, it'd be better if I had control over when and where.

410
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,850
The more you talk, the more I hate you.

411
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,550
Do you know how hard I tried to find you?

412
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,750
I traveled all over the country to find your body.

413
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,280
Let me ask you a question.

414
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,820
Are you guys having a meeting at Goongnakwon all together?

415
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,720
Why are you all here?

416
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,580
We all have our own reasons.

417
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,050
Just like how you come here to deliver vegetables.

418
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,250
You're the one who told me to come here.

419
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,180
You're the one who made me deliver vegetables to Goongnakwon.

420
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,450
What about Yeo Kyung?

421
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,850
Yeo Kyung?

422
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,750
Do you even think of her?

423
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,280
You seriously shouldn't be like this.

424
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,660
Yeo Kyung has been worried sick about you.

425
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,220
She is devastated.

426
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,280
Don't tell her that we met.

427
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,150
It will break her heart.

428
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,750
It's better if she doesn't find out.

429
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,450
So let's keep it like that, okay?

430
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,620
You want me to keep it from her? How?

431
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,160
Since the day you got stabbed,

432
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,250
Yeo Kyung has led a miserable life.

433
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,380
She never...

434
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,520
passed a day comfortably.

435
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,150
I'm doing this because I know how she is.

436
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,020
Yeo Kyung will be in danger if she finds out that I'm here.

437
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,180
Don't tell Yeo Kyung that I'm here.

438
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,120
You should go tell her yourself.

439
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,780
If you can't do that,

440
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,320
just give her a call.

441
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,750
Do you understand?

442
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,780
(Yeo Kyung)

443
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,520
Darn it.

444
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,750
Who are you?

445
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,560
Please don't do this.

446
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,580
My gosh.

447
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,380
Did you find anything?

448
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,820
Not really.

449
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,290
Nothing was recorded.

450
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,080
That's too bad.

451
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,780
That's our only evidence.

452
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,350
What are we going to do?

453
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,350
Well...

454
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,030
maybe we should do some legwork.

455
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,520
There might be a witness.

456
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,820
Okay. I got it.

457
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,720
(Delete)

458
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,650
(Are you sure?)

459
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,880
(Congressman So Tae Seop)

460
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,750
Yes, Congressman.

461
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,990
Did you wait for long?

462
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,220
No, Sir. I had a chance to get some fresh air.

463
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,550
It looks like you've been through a lot.

464
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,380
It's not easy to do planned investigation as the first-year.

465
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,320
I understand.

466
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,120
You may come across some obstacles.

467
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,580
That's the crossroad.

468
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,720
Some give up,

469
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,020
and some either punch though or jump over that wall.

470
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,550
Thankfully, you're the latter.

471
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,990
I like that about you.

472
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,250
I may collapse because of the wall,

473
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,520
but I'll never give up.

474
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,380
Do you know...

475
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,680
a man named Kim Gil Do?

476
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,490
I've never heard of him.

477
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Look him up.

478
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,620
You'll find some interesting things.

479
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,120
(Kim Gil Do)

480
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,580
Let's see.

481
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,850
Among people born from 1955 to 1965,

482
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,580
there is a total of 461 people registered under Kim Gil Do.

483
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,850
Let's narrow it down.

484
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,240
Can you sort out special people like people on prosecution suspension,

485
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,350
ex-convicts, missing people and wanted criminals?

486
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,650
From 1989 to 1995.

487
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,520
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

488
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,950
But who is this Kim Gil Do?

489
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,690
- Is he...
 -  Are information prior to 1995...

490
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,950
also stored in the computer system?

491
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,120
It's probably not accurate.

492
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,470
Even if you find some on the system,

493
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,630
you have to go to the branches and check the information yourself.

494
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,250
It'll take only 2 to 3 days for us to go down and look for them.

495
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,550
First of all, please sort out special persons.

496
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,020
Okay.

497
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
Let's do this. We're almost there.

498
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,320
I thought you were going to destroy him. What happened?

499
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,180
How is he?

500
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,180
He fell asleep.

501
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,950
He doesn't pay much attention to me.

502
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,350
My goodness, Father. You are so cold-hearted.

503
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,420
How can you...

504
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,880
never even call my name after waking up?

505
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,150
Ms Seol, please do me a favour.

506
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,880
Can we stall the competition...

507
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,550
until he wakes up again?

508
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,450
When will that be?

509
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,180
I'm not sure when that will be.

510
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,520
Do you know?

511
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,950
Will you be like this?

512
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,490
You're the one who is misjudging the situation.

513
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,380
It's not the time to be greedy. It's time for you to make a choice.

514
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,850
Will it be me, or Mr Ha?

515
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,620
Ms Seol.

516
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,580
- Father.
 -  Dae Cheon.

517
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Father.

518
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,410
Mr Ko.

519
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,720
Father, it's me, Gang Sook.

520
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,180
I'm listening, so please speak.

521
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,060
Da...

522
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,080
What?

523
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,950
Da Hae.

524
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,990
Da Hae?

525
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,650
Ms Ko.

526
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,850
Ms Seol.

527
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,720
Sit down.

528
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,520
Sir, it's me, Da Hae.

529
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,080
Did you want to say something?

530
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,320
Why?

531
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,850
Do you want me to leave?

532
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,950
We'll be outside.

533
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,850
Let's go.

534
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,820
Sir, you can take your time.

535
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,820
I'll wait for you. Don't make it too hard on yourself.

536
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,720
Cho...

537
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,850
Cho...

538
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,350
What?

539
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,630
Cho...

540
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,550
Cho, and what else?

541
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,350
Help! We need help!

542
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,350
Dae Cheon.

543
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,430
Father.

544
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,920
- Father.
 -  Dae Cheon.

545
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,420
It was a light stroke.

546
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,080
Right now, he needs to rest.

547
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,600
What did he say?

548
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,250
He was about to say something, but he had a stroke.

549
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Is that true?

550
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,850
Yes, Ms Ko.

551
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,650
Don't push her. She has no reason to lie.

552
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,080
I'm just curious.

553
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,250
Goodbye.

554
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,150
Goodbye, Ms Ko.

555
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,820
See you later.

556
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,880
Da Hae.

557
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,150
It looks like...

558
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,020
he's only going to speak to you.

559
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,350
Did he really say nothing?

560
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,780
You can tell me.

561
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,620
No.

562
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,130
You have to tell me.

563
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,320
I told you, he said nothing. How many times did I tell you?

564
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,580
At times, there is something...

565
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,120
called an instinct, which can't be explained logically.

566
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,150
We call that our gut feeling. You know that, right?

567
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,550
That's how I feel right now.

568
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,920
I can feel that you are hiding something.

569
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,230
I am also speculating that you and Mr Ha must have a past, too.

570
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,250
Stop it.

571
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,020
I am sick of your suspicions.

572
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,750
Suspicions don't go away until they become confirmed.

573
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,820
That day will soon come.

574
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,360
And if I confirm that my feelings and speculations were correct,

575
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,380
you will have to...

576
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,180
pay for it.

577
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,450
I warned you before...

578
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,050
that this is a fight between adults.

579
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,950
It's a war, so it won't be weird to see someone die.

580
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,250
Do you know why people begin to take sides?

581
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,880
It's because they want to live.

582
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,280
They can't stand out on their own.

583
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,680
There will come a time when you'll have to make a choice.

584
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,150
So I hope...

585
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,650
you make a wise decision.

586
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,620
Ko Dae Cheon regained his consciousness,

587
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,420
and he began to talk, although he's still inarticulate.

588
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,030
That's an unexpected variable.

589
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,120
That's what I hate the most.

590
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,720
Unexpected variables.

591
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,380
They're unpredictable,

592
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,780
and you never know what they'll lead to.

593
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
In that case,

594
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,160
Ms Ko will try to stall the competition.

595
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,220
I did stop it.

596
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,020
But...

597
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,160
Mr Ha will want to do it quickly...

598
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,660
before Mr Ko fully regains his consciousness.

599
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,680
But you know what?

600
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,060
There is another variable.

601
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,080
It's Kim Da Hae.

602
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,220
She's on special terms with Mr Ko.

603
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,480
And there's something between her and Mr Ha, too.

604
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,180
I put her in there, but I'm not sure if she's on my side.

605
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,480
- I will try to find out.
 -  Focus on what she's hiding...

606
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,750
instead of what she knows.

607
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,780
That'll be faster.

608
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,180
Okay.

609
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,520
One more thing.

610
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,320
What will you do after you become Head of Noodles?

611
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,680
I will go on TV shows with Mr Ha.

612
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,350
I will tell the world about how unsubstantial...

613
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,050
Mr Ha and his skills are on TV.

614
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,180
I will make him lose his job,

615
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,350
and then think about what I'll do after that.

616
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,950
Your next goal must be...

617
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,260
Goongnak Foundation.

618
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,020
Mr Ha's hideous crimes are...

619
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,360
swarming in that place.

620
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,620
Fine.

621
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,180
I don't mind losing Goongnak Foundation.

622
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:18,850
I am...

623
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,120
only interested in Goongnakwon.

624
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,350
Cho...

625
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,950
Do you know about the competition tomorrow?

626
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,450
- You'll be fine.
 -  I picked you as my assistant.

627
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,050
What?

628
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,750
Who says that you can do that?

629
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,030
It's hard enough for me since I'm preparing for my test.

630
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,250
How can I assist you?

631
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,450
I need your perfect sense of smell.

632
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,760
If I can't get the smell right for medicinal herb noodles,

633
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,780
it'll be a failure.

634
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,080
I'll help you through your test in return.

635
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,450
You do know that...

636
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,950
you will be disapproved...

637
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,350
if you can't make the order, right?

638
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,020
Jin Hak was disapproved only after two orders.

639
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,220
He couldn't make baby octopus noodles.

640
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,760
I will teach you...

641
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,920
difficult recipes when someone orders them.

642
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,720
How does that sound?

643
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,020
Well, I guess that's fair.

644
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,380
What should I do first?

645
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:39,850
Sleep well.

646
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,320
That's the first step.

647
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,010
What are you doing?

648
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,070
Sorry?

649
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:31,380
You were looking around like a baby who lost his mum.

650
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,060
It's nothing.

651
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,080
Stop.

652
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,080
I haven't seen you before. Which department are you in?

653
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,340
I am Assistant Park Tae Ha.

654
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,520
Assistant? Assistant to who?

655
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,650
To Mr Ha.

656
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,460
Oh, really?

657
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,660
You should've told me.

658
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,750
Who are you looking for?

659
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,820
It's nothing.

660
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,780
Tae Ha?

661
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,020
You found her.

662
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,320
You found who you were looking for.

663
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,390
I am such a lonely woman,

664
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,130
but I guess some of us aren't.

665
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,950
You're dating at work.

666
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,180
Don't worry about her. She's like that.

667
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,390
What's up?

668
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,420
Right.

669
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,420
Thank you for the other day.

670
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,850
What are you doing after work?

671
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,220
Are you asking me out?

672
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,620
No.

673
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,280
I just asked you what you were doing.

674
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,720
I was just curious.

675
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,180
What's your plan?

676
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,280
I just...

677
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,320
eat, wash up and sleep.

678
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:46,900
My goodness.

679
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,580
Just dine with him.

680
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,100
You two will never get anywhere.

681
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,180
Hey, come on.

682
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,920
I'm sorry, though.

683
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,250
I have to prepare for the competition tomorrow.

684
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,560
What's the competition?

685
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,650
It's to get the head of noodles.

686
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,620
Deputy Head of Noodles and Myeong are competing tomorrow.

687
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,780
I am Myeong's assistant,

688
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,380
so I don't have the time today.

689
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,120
Oh, I see.

690
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,520
I'm sorry to bother you.

691
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,720
How is your hand?

692
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,150
It's fine, Sir.

693
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,150
Did you use up the money?

694
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,080
People say that we use money like we use water.

695
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,300
Money is very easy to use.

696
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,220
It's not easy to use someone else's money like water.

697
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,690
It's easier with someone else's money.

698
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:00,520
I've never done that, so I wouldn't know.

699
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,850
I don't like...

700
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,250
people who aren't flexible.

701
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,480
It's the worst when someone is single-minded...

702
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,820
and dull.

703
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,240
I'm sorry.

704
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,250
But...

705
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,080
it doesn't seem so bad now.

706
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,720
That means the person is honest.

707
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,920
It's a compliment.

708
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,680
- Thank you.
 -  These are important times.

709
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,980
I won't accept any small mistakes...

710
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,830
or unseen variables.

711
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,620
Are you referring to the competition?

712
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,620
That man named Myeong of the noodles department...

713
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,450
keeps on getting on my nerves.

714
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,150
I can see right through him,

715
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,480
and he has sharp teeth.

716
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,850
It's not easy for me to shun him nor take him in.

717
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,920
He's very different form you.

718
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,080
I need his background check.

719
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,580
Keep an eye on him,

720
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,260
and report to me if anything seems suspicious.

721
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,280
Yes, Sir.

722
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,520
Welcome, Congressman.

723
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,820
I hope I'm not interfering with your affairs.

724
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,250
Of course not.

725
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,880
This way, please.

726
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,120
Can you smell the broth?

727
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,050
Guess what it is.

728
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,220
Milk vetch root, acanthopanax,

729
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,780
kudzu root,

730
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,020
lycium fruit, date...

731
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,080
and Chinese gooseberry.

732
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,880
Wow, you really do have a perfect sense of smell.

733
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,620
Do you know...

734
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,550
a medicinal herb that first smells like Jerusalem artichoke,

735
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,650
then milk vetch root with...

736
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,850
a hint of bitterness at the end?

737
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,450
Any ideas?

738
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,580
My nose isn't that good.

739
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,920
I guess no one could be able to make sense of that.

740
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,620
What makes you so curious?

741
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:30,150
I smelled that herb on three people.

742
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:32,850
It's not a common smell.

743
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,290
Isn't that strange?

744
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,380
Who are they?

745
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,550
We shall begin the competition for Head of Noodles.

746
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,950
You already know what to make and what the rules are.

747
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,850
Congressman So Tae Seop has graced us with his presence.

748
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:20,050
I hope you make a lovely bowl of noodles...

749
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,220
befitting of Goongnakwon's fame and reputation.

750
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,020
You may begin.

751
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,320
So I said,

752
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,500
"You have a rock for a head and an ugly face."

753
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,200
"All you're good at is tell lies, so what will you grow up to be?"

754
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,020
Do you know what he said?

755
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,820
He said, "I'll become a politician."

756
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,900
He's now our prime minister.

757
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,150
My goodness.

758
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,050
No wonder.

759
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,020
There are many people like that.

760
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,180
Who would've known you'd become a politician?

761
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,200
Didn't you study history in college?

762
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,380
I did.

763
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,100
Ms Ko studied fashion design,

764
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,900
and now she runs Goongnakwon.

765
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,180
Don't you think modelling would suit your figure better?

766
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:54,280
Mr Ha, what must a man do to gain the love of such a beauty?

767
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,720
Things just happened, in my case.

768
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,190
Are you unwell?

769
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,500
No, I'm fine.

770
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,050
I'd like to ask you something.

771
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,850
You went to Seoul National University.

772
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,920
You must've been busy studying and falling in love.

773
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,650
When did you learn to make noodles?

774
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:21,720
I didn't do all three at the same time.

775
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,420
Forget about falling in love.

776
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,920
It was an arranged marriage.

777
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,180
Oh, was it?

778
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,150
Could you excuse me?

779
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,720
Why did you decide to make five coloured noodles?

780
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,850
It's the only dish my mother made me.

781
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,220
What's that?

782
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,150
A medicine and poison.

783
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,980
It's the last thing I add to the broth.

784
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,980
A medicine and poison?

785
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,320
A small amount is a medicine, but a large amount is a neurotoxin.

786
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,950
I wanted to show someone who used this as poison...

787
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,320
that it can also be used as medicine.

788
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,150
What is this herb called?

789
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,780
"Cho". It's the root of the alpine monkshood.

790
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,080
It was used to kill people in the Joseon Dynasty period.

791
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,950
Mr Ko.

792
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,120
(Seongbuk-dong Robbery Homicide, April 30, 1980)

793
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,880
Yes?

794
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,760
I think I found something on Kim Gil Do.

795
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,980
I'll fax it over.

796
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,820
Okay.

797
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,950
I hate to do this.

798
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,780
But...

799
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,550
I hate the idea of going back even more.

800
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:08,550
Gil Do.

801
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,350
Stop it.

802
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,920
(Thief and murderer wanted, 3,000-dollar reward)

803
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,480
(Master of Revenge)
