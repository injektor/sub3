00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,150
(ID card: Kim Gil Do)

5
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,360
Kim Gil Do?

6
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,060
How do you know this name?

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,500
Don't say that name...

8
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,680
ever again.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,420
What if I keep talking about the name?

10
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,580
You!

11
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,860
It wasn't a lie?

12
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,230
It's his real name.

13
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,300
Mum?

14
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,630
Mum.

15
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,660
I will be there soon.

16
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
This is just between the two of us.

17
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't tell anyone.

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,060
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

19
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,460
And Ms Ko told me to keep an eye on Da Hae.

20
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,530
I'm being a spy for both you and Ms Ko.

21
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Figure out what Ms Ko knows about Da Hae.

22
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,030
By the way,

23
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,800
when will you crush Ha Jung Tae?

24
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,960
Remember that I've been working here...

25
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,500
for the past 10 years to finish him off.

26
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,130
It already began.

27
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,400
We are almost there.

28
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,730
Do your best.

29
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,930
If you don't do it right,

30
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,500
I will make you regret it.

31
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,100
(DNA Parentage Test Report)

32
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,030
Kim Da Hae is...

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,130
Ha Jung Tae's daughter.

34
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,700
But it is a secret that no one should find out.

35
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,060
Did she try so hard to come to Goongnakwon...

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,060
because of this?

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,530
Or is there another reason?

38
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,700
Why did you want to see me?

39
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,060
It's not like there must be a reason.

40
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,960
It's been a while since we met.

41
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,660
I thought we saw each other for a reason.

42
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,230
Do you know how many cheques have been issued...

43
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,900
with a false issue number?

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,960
It's been taken care of at our branch so far.

45
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,830
I'm not sure if you remember that.

46
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,930
I paid you for that.

47
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,260
By the way,

48
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,600
did I tell you that my son is going abroad to study?

49
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,430
It costs a lot.

50
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,400
It cost as much as an annual salary of a manager in a major company.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,930
And the plane ticket is very expensive.

52
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,930
I didn't mean to tell you that.

53
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,860
It's hard to live your life as a breadwinner.

54
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Don't you think?

55
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,960
Mr Park will be in the car park. Give this to him.

56
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,600
What is this?

57
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,860
Don't ask questions. Just do as you are told.

58
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Yes, Sir.

59
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,400
Are you Mr Park?

60
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,700
What took you so long?

61
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,000
My goodness, how cheap of him.

62
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,400
Why does he have my mum's picture?

63
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,900
Why does he have the keepsake from my mother?

64
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,540
He abandoned us.

65
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,830
He's the one who made us tremble with anger.

66
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,660
Are you all right?

67
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,160
You are not supposed to be here.

68
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,210
I was just...

69
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,330
Do you want me to shout?

70
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,230
Actually, I work here.

71
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,930
I'm a driver.

72
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,660
Only kitchen staff are allowed in here.

73
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,260
Sorry.

74
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Wait.

75
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm done crying.

76
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,830
Oh, okay.

77
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,660
You said you're a driver. Who do you drive?

78
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,030
Mr Ha.

79
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,730
Okay. You can go.

80
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,030
I wasn't going to say this, but I must.

81
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,330
You have flour under your eye.

82
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,200
Stand still.

83
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,730
There.

84
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,970
I'll go now.

85
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,530
I told you all my secrets.

86
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,860
It's all over if they find out we're from the same orphanage.

87
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,430
What are you doing here when you know that?

88
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,200
Before I went to prison,

89
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,760
I thought I just had to do my time and start over.

90
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,900
But now that I'm out,

91
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,730
I feel worse than when I was inside.

92
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,700
I was flailing in a swamp I couldn't get out of,

93
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,400
and I got sick of it.

94
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,260
I'm here for myself.

95
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,530
I want to be acknowledged by whoever needs me and succeed.

96
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,500
- That's all.
 -  You don't mean that.

97
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,730
I know you.

98
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,900
You wouldn't do something like this for yourself.

99
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,320
Tae Ha.

100
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,330
You don't know me.

101
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,100
Just like how I don't know you.

102
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,470
Do you know what I regret the most?

103
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,000
Going to prison instead of Yeo Kyung.

104
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,100
What you just said...

105
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you mean it?

106
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
I meant everything I said.

107
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,730
I've changed, Myeong.

108
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,860
Just like you have.

(Photos saved)

111
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,960
I gave it to Mr Park.

112
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,560
Unless I give you a job,

113
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,940
watch labourer Kim Da Hae.

114
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,640
Do you mean, I should protect her?

115
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,760
Just keep an eye on her.

116
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,780
Do not let her come into my office.

117
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,830
Yes, Sir.

118
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,860
I mentioned the matter to my husband already.

119
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,800
I invited you over to ask for your opinion.

120
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,840
About what?

121
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,760
I'm going to promote Kim Da Hae to join the noodle department.

122
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
You can't.

123
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,410
I said it's too soon.

124
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,500
How strange.

125
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,900
The ice-cold man gets all worked up whenever I mention her.

126
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,730
Is there a reason?

127
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,230
Ever since Myeong solved the broth problem,

128
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,410
sales have been soaring.

129
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,960
I don't see why Da Hae can't do the same.

130
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,500
What do you say?

131
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,030
Nothing is more entertaining than watching a fight.

132
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,000
But I've seen you two fight so often. It's almost boring.

133
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,360
You asked for my opinion, so I'll give it to you.

134
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,100
I'm all for it.

135
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,300
Speak up if you will.

136
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,830
But the decision will remain the same.

137
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,110
You are making a mistake.

138
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,200
I thought...

139
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,800
it could be a mistake.

140
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,500
But your reaction tells me...

141
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,600
that it's not, after all.

142
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,630
Noodle department, Kim Da Hae.

143
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,230
Yes?

144
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,830
Did you just say "noodle department"?

145
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,130
Of all the labourers who worked in our kitchen,

146
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,860
you were the best.

147
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,330
I bet everyone will agree. Well done.

148
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,960
Go to Mr Ha's office. He'll give you a new name-tag.

149
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,200
Thank you.

150
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,330
Noodle department, Kim Da Hae.

151
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,600
It's like a ceremony.

152
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,300
I affix all the name-tags on our workers.

153
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,060
And I'm the one to take them off.

154
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,500
I hope...

155
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,730
I won't have to take this off.

156
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,930
Kim Gil Do.

157
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,330
Is that your real name?

158
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,960
Don't go too far.

159
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
My office is fine.

(Kim Da Hae, Noodle Team)

161
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,100
My mum.

162
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,530
Did you love her?

163
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,930
But not the secret room.

164
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,930
Stay away.

165

Kim Da Hae.

166
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,960
Congratulations.

167
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,200
Congratulations.

168
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,660
You climbed up a stage.

169
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,000
Keep climbing.

170
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Show him.

171
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,130
Thank you.

172
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,680
We should celebrate over a drink.

173
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,510
You know I can't drink.

174
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,600
Oh, yes. I remember now.

175
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,900
You passed out after two cups, right?

176
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,570
One cup.

177
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,200
I was out by the second.

178
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,030
You have something for me.

179
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,860
There's a safe in the wall.

180
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,580
I couldn't open it because of the passcode.

181
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,200
It's more dangerous than I thought.

182
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,460
What do you mean?

183
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,430
You don't have to know. Are there any other photos?

184
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,360
Mr Ha almost caught me.

185
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,860
That's all I was able to take.

186
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,630
Can I trust you?

187
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,660
You don't trust anyone.

188
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,700
Doubting is your hobby.

189
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,100
Okay, I'll trust you this time.

190
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,930
But I expect something more detailed next time.

191
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,930
It's too hard. I might get caught.

192
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,060
Don't get caught.

193
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,000
Goongnak Foundation and a safe for the cash.

194
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,400
I can think of only one thing.

195
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,790
Money laundering.

196
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,670
I knew he was up to something, but I wasn't expecting this.

197
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,930
Nothing works like money when trying to make connections.

198
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,100
Especially dirty money.

199
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,530
They won't turn against each other that easily.

200
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,630
As soon as one does, they both perish.

201
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's it.

202
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,470
I don't want to expose Goongnakwon to such dangers.

203
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,730
I feel the same way.

204
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,200
Let's find a solution.

205
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,630
That's enough for today.

206
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,830
Da Hae...

207
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,460
got promoted.

208
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,430
Whose idea was it?

209
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,240
It was Ms Ko's. I just went along with it.

210
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,330
What's her logic?

211
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,200
I guess she thinks Da Hae's loyal to her. Although she's mistaken.

212
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
The chefs...

213
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,700
have to be in the kitchen at all times.

214
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,170
- Naturally.
 -  Then she can't see the old man.

215
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,930
She has no excuse to be anywhere else.

216
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,680
She had Da Hae promoted...

217
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,330
so she can't go to the other building.

218
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,000
It can't be.

219
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,930
That means something's going on.

220
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,000
Something no one can know about.

221
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,990
You won't have time to come here.

222
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,230
I wanted to thank you.

223
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,110
I owe you for the promotion.

224
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,430
I didn't get to congratulate you properly.

225
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,530
It's all you. I didn't do anything.

226
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,300
It was a unanimous decision, so that means you did well.

227
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,930
Did no one object?

228
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,130
Even Mr Ha acknowledged you.

229
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,060
So...

230
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,000
how is your father?

231
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,000
He won't even blink for me.

232
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,330
Da Hae.

233
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,860
The only person I can trust in Goongnakwon...

234
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,500
is you.

235
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,100
You're the only one I can tell how I really feel.

236
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,000
I sometimes wonder how nice it would be...

237
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,170
if you were my daughter.

238
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,080
I worry how I'd feel...

239
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,980
if you let me down after trusting you so much.

240
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,530
But then again, we can't control our emotions, can we?

241
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,260
That won't happen.

242
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,630
Do you mean that?

243
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,670
Can you promise?

244
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Yes.

245
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,730
Thank you.

246
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,230
Hearing that melts my heart.

247
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,410
Excuse me.

248
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,430
Yes, Sir?

249
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,530
Sir.

250
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,630
He said the noodles are soft and that they fall apart.

251
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,670
It's the third time today.

252
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Okay.

253
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,330
Apologise to the customer.

254
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,410
We'll serve a fresh bowl.

255
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,430
Yes, Sir.

256
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,760
What's wrong?

257
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,200
The bittern's different.

258
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
Compare it.

259
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,200
It lacks sodium.

260
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,880
What's the matter?

261
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,530
The bittern's salt concentration is different.

262
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,700
Today's supply is weaker.

263
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,600
It was watered down.

264
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,110
The glutinosity of flour drops on humid days.

265
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,000
That plus the weaker bittern explains the noodles' texture.

266
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,800
The bittern is a serious problem.

267
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,580
A restaurant like this should be making your own supply.

268
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,500
That takes a lot of time and effort.

269
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,060
Dose that mean...

270
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,670
we should give up?

271
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,630
It should be spot in the sun, but with no direct sunlight.

272
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,030
This spot should do it.

273
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,560
Put that there.

274
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,300
First, put the sack of bay salt on top of the crock.

275
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,340
This is common practice.

276
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,010
Even I can do this.

277
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,210
Do you know about adding Chinese yam powder?

278
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,230
Chinese yam powder?

279
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,500
That increases the stickiness of the dough.

280
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,000
For every bowl of bittern, one tablespoonful should do.

281
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,860
This is how I make bittern.

282
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,660
It sounds like a secret recipe.

283
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,860
Why are you sharing it?

284
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,400
So that we can make better noodles.

285
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,760
Do I need another reason?

286
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,230
Very well. Let's give it a go.

287
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,600
But if it fails, we're going to give up.

288
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,900
Sir.

289
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,160
We can use shrimp eggs instead when making wheat vermicelli.

290
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,380
It improves the stickiness and texture.

291
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,500
I've been making dough for 15 years.

292
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,630
I've never heard of anyone using shrimp eggs...

293
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,930
instead of bittern.

294
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,900
Just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

295
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,730
I've tried it.

296
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,220
It's delicious.

297
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,230
Are you sure?

298
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:58,930
Yes.

299
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,160
Okay, then. Let's try both.

300
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,130
I'm willing to try anything.

301
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,400
Something's bound to work.

302
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,930
I've never heard of the shrimp egg technique.

303
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,400
Didn't you tell me not to talk to you?

304
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,900
Noodles are an exception.

305
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,600
I don't know much about noodles.

306
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,530
I hadn't tasted many kinds, and no one taught me.

307
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,060
So I gave anything a go.

308
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,100
I got lucky with the shrimp eggs.

309
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,300
It was really delicious.

310
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,360
The shrimp egg flavour fills your mouth with each mouthful.

311
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,960
It would be perfect with beef brisket broth.

312
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,560
How do you know that?

313
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,500
A mix of beef and fish broth was the best combination.

314
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,430
- The ratio was...
 -  Was it 5 to 1?

315
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,910
Hey.

316
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,820
- Isn't it odd?
 -  What is?

317
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,760
We lose track of time talking about noodles.

318
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,600
You're right.

319
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,360
Try your best...

320
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,130
to survive the hazing.

321
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,330
I could do with a break.

322
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
It's nice.

323
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,200
Especially the shrimp egg noodles.

324
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,160
I like the flavour and clean aftertaste.

325
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,160
I didn't know you were so imaginative.

326
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,000
Did you happen to add Chinese yam powder...

327
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,400
to the bittern?

328
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,840
Yes.

329
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,560
It improves the dough.

330
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
That's the bittern...

331
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,580
Chimyeon Restaurant used in the past.

332
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,700
Not any more, though.

333
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,800
It really does improve the noodles' texture and flavour.

334
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,700
Did you decide to take out the powder?

335
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,330
We had to keep up with the demands.

336
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I quite liked...

337
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,560
the shrimp egg noodles.

338
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,860
Are you trying to get promoted?

339
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,730
Well done.

340
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,660
Sales are going up again.

341
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
I see you...

342
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,730
in a different light now.

343
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
You can leave.

344
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,030
The Chinese yam powder in the bittern...

345
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,230
was Myeong's idea.

346
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,300
The shrimp egg noodles was Da Hae's suggestion.

347
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,360
I can't take the credit.

348
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,640
All I did was prevent their creative ideas from being ignored.

349
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,830
You're a hardhead.

350
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,160
You're very stubborn.

351
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,330
I apologise.

352
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,000
It's a compliment.

353
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,230
You could have taken all the credit,

354
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,560
but instead you told the truth.

355
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,360
That's not easy.

356
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,030
You can leave.

357
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Thank you.

358
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,430
I think we can promote him.

359
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,840
He seems to have the respect of his team,

360
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,500
although he lacks the skill.

361
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,660
He can make up for that through leadership.

362
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,130
What do you think?

363
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,900
There's no need to rush.

364
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,660
You waited this long. Put it off a little longer.

365
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,500
Is this about Myeong?

366
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,830
Wake up.

367
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,530
Even if he becomes the head, that doesn't make Goongnakwon yours.

368
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,200
How interesting.

369
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,760
It sounds offensive,

370
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,830
but it makes me want to give it a shot.

371
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,800
Sales are rising because Myeong solved the broth problem.

372
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,690
He is well qualified. No, he's more than qualified.

373
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,630
He just recently joined the noodle team.

374
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,700
Now you want him to be the head?

375
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,000
Things don't go that easily in Goongnakwon.

376
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,600
The Moon family will...

377
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,460
make an issue out of it.

378
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,800
That family likes people who brings in money.

379
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,500
Don't you know that already?

380
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,860
Let's think about it.

381
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
That's enough...

382
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,130
for today.

383
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,400
No.

384
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,100
Since she brought this up, I'd like to finalise the issue.

385
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,160
Deputy Head of Noodles and Moo Myeong...

386
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,980
Let's make them compete for Head of Noodles.

387
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,460
Don't be ridiculous.

388
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,560
You startled me. Why is it ridiculous?

389
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,060
If you keep rejecting, I will have the Moon family interfere.

390
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,660
You have only three months left. Let's wait and see how it goes.

391
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,600
Do you really want to do this?

392
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,600
I will make a formal suggestion for the competition.

393
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,860
I know Ms Ko will go against the idea.

394
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
So it depends on you.

395
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,430
Please give me some time to consider it carefully.

396
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,700
I will tell you tomorrow.

397
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,110
Ma'am.

398
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,960
Da Hae. Go bring Deputy Head of Noodles to me.

399
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,930
Deputy Head of Noodles is in Mr Ha's office now.

400
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,730
What?

401
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,100
A competition for Head of Noodles?

402
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,660
Moo Myeong will compete against you.

403
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,000
He just joined noodle department.

404
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,860
I've been Deputy Head of Noodles for five years.

405
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,130
If you give up,

406
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,460
you will be Deputy Head of Noodles for 10 years.

407
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,900
It is your call.

408
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
Listen.

409
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,600
I will let you...

410
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,300
win the competition.

411
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,760
You will never lose the competition.

412
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,340
But...

413
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,630
you have to promise me that you will be my person.

414
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,130
I will play fair and square.

415
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,930
I don't want to be dishonest.

416
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,500
You are too inflexible.

417
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,430
You are stubborn.

418
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,860
This is not a compliment.

419
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,700
If Moo Myeong becomes Head of Noodles, you will have to resign.

420
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,930
Do you want the past 15 years to come to nothing?

421
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,360
Play fair and square.

422
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,660
You won't lose.

423
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,100
I'm just...

424
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,930
being supportive.

425
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,930
I'm not rejecting...

426
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,530
to be your person.

427
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,930
But I don't want to be Head of Noodles with your support.

428
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,430
If I do, the past 15 years will come to nothing.

429
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
I may not be good enough,

430
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,600
but I want to do it on my own.

431
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,700
Don't you get it?

432
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,000
If you become my person,

433
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,360
I will make you become Head of Noodles.

434
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,030
If you reject,

435
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,400
I will make you leave Goongnakwon for good.

436
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,860
Your eyes will tire out. Take it easy for a while.

437
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,230
We ransacked a private loan company. But the accounting is perfect.

438
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,230
No unlawful connections.

439
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,030
No circumstantial evidence for illegal contract.

440
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,100
Take a look at this.

441
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,880
16 people got arrested for illegal gambling.

442
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,130
Small business owners, lawyers and bank managers are involved.

443
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,860
What is this?

444
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,630
That bank manager works at Naegok branch of Gwangmyeong Bank.

445
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,880
The bank manager bet 480 thousand dollars.

446
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,430
And he had a few cheques.

447
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,360
Do you know whose name was used to issue the cheques?

448
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,630
Goongnakwon?

449
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,160
You just got lucky.

450
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,960
Who do you want to summon first?

451
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,980
For running an illegal gambling place,

452
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,230
they arrested Mr Yoon who was in charge on May 31.

453
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,420
Among the 16 people who are involved,

454
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,900
there was a bank manager, a national athlete...

455
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,000
Did you know Mr Park was gambling?

456
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,260
I was not interested in his private life.

457
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,630
Did you ever give him money without me knowing?

458
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
He whined about his son studying abroad,

459
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,030
so I gave him some money.

460
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,930
Oh, my goodness.

461
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,730
We will be examined by the prosecution. What should we do?

462
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,880
Goongnak Foundation is on a tight budget.

463
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,930
If they find out, all the money will disappear.

464
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,770
Why are you being so cowardly? I didn't think you were like that.

465
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,800
What?

466
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,160
It's not that I'm being cowardly.

467
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,460
It's that you are being too bold.

468
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,400
Do you want to know how to be bold?

469
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,400
I know.

470
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,930
I didn't know he gambled.

471
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,400
What are you talking about?

472
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,900
Just come and have some coffee with me.

473
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,520
The prosecutor in charge is newly appointed.

474
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,090
I will take care of it.

475
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,260
Don't worry about it.

476
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Okay, then.

477
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,230
I will go have some coffee with you soon.

478
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,430
Okay.

479
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,260
How many times did I tell you?

480
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,830
Don't worry about it.

481
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,230
Just mind your business.

482
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,230
You see,

483
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,160
there will be search and confiscation.

484
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:21,230
They will desperately try to find your fault.

485
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,570
How can I not get worried?

486
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,700
You may be able to make Mr Park not speak about it.

487
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,600
But what about Mr Choi?

488
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,100
There will be no way out when the prosecutor starts investigating.

489
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,070
That won't happen.

490
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,130
If it does,

491
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,830
I will stop it.

492
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,430
I will take care of it.

493
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,540
Are you busy?

494
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,710
No.

495
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,860
Come see me out.

496
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,660
Is everything okay?

497
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,500
I'm just driving.

498
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,930
If you just drive, there will be no problem.

499
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
Oh, no.

500
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,320
Excuse me.

501
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,330
I'm sorry.

502
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,760
Should I pretend not to know him like this?

503
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,930
Yes.

504
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
That's easy.

505
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,700
Tae Ha.

506
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,860
Listen carefully.

507
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,510
Mr Ha and I are already in a pile of mess.

508
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,760
There is no way out for us.

509
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,860
Do you know how people who are in a mess...

510
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,930
make friends?

511
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,930
They involve...

512
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,330
their friends in the mess.

513
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,680
Mr Ha will give you a job soon.

514
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,440
If you want to do it, make sure to do it right.

515
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,030
If not, you should quit immediately.

516
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,530
I'm telling you again.

517
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,500
You can't hesitate...

518
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,630
even for a second. Do you understand?

519
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,460
I'm not going to look back.

520
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,960
That's why I'm worried about you.

521
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,230
You should look back from time to time.

522
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,070
You are not a turtle. You should look back sometimes.

523
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,300
You failed to protect my father.

524
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,260
But I will protect my friends no matter what.

525
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,330
Your friends?

526
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,330
You have other friends?

527
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,730
You must be busy.

528
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,400
Are you a honeybee or what?

529
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,530
(Mr Ha)

530
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,070
Yes, Sir.

531
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,360
I will be right there.

532
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,030
Where would you like to go, Sir?

533
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,230
To Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

534
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,310
I'm sorry, sir?

535
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,570
To Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

536
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,730
Why?

537
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,500
Do you have a problem going there?

538
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
No, Sir.

539
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,660
Why do you need to go the prosecutor's office?

540
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
I'm sorry.

541
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,960
It's all right. You can ask that much.

542
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm going to get some coffee.

543
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,960
I see.

544
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,100
Hello, Mr Ko.

545
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,700
I heard Ha Jung Tae was summoned.

546
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,460
I tossed the ball.

547
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,660
She's good at hitting them right into court.

548
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,760
Mr Ko, listen to me carefully.

549
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,860
Do not take a part in this case.

550
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,660
Just watch.

551
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,070
I want to see how well Ms Chae takes care of this.

552
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,960
You know how I am.

553
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,570
When I want to make use of someone,

554
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,300
I make sure I use them fully.

555
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,330
Is Mr Park still keeping his silence?

556
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,960
He's just killing time. I think he has some connections.

557
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,100
He said that he borrowed the money, but he won't say from whom.

558
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,400
We'll have to meet his connection.

559
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,270
Also, summon Mr Choi, who works for Mr Park.

560
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,460
We'll find out something if we ask the right questions.

561
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,260
Ms Chae's office.

562
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,360
Yes, Chief.

563
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,070
Yes, Sir.

564
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,900
Ms Chae, it's the chief.

565
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,830
(Chief Prosecutor's office)

566
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,660
Hello, Chief.

567
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,000
Hello, Mr Ahn.

568
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,500
Welcome, Ms Chae. Introduce yourself.

569
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,000
This is Mr Ha of Goongnakwon.

570
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,930
This is the prosecutor in charge.

571
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,660
Nice to meet you. I'm Ha Jung Tae.

572
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,130
I am Chae Yeo Kyung.

573
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,430
Take a seat.

574
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,940
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to speak in private with...

575
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,230
Nonsense.

576
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,930
Are you saying that the chief privately called you here?

577
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,660
That's not what I'm saying.

578
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,380
But I don't think this is reasonable.

579
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,900
Ms Chae, no one asked for your opinion.

580
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:03,330
I just said what's wrong is wrong. Do I need to get scolded for that?

581
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,210
Hey!

582
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,000
You can leave. I don't want to be misunderstood.

583
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,760
I'm sorry if I was impolite.

584
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,730
My goodness. She must be out of her mind.

585
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,660
This doesn't seem like a place for a cup of coffee.

586
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,130
Today's last order is cheongmyeon.

587
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,930
It's our tradition to let the person in charge...

588
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,260
make the last order of their first day.

589
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,760
Can you do it?

590
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,700
Oh, well...

591
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,580
You must be talking about the dish made by...

592
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,330
mixing mung bean powder and water. You sift it through a thin cloth...

593
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,580
and cook in a double boiler and serve it cold with omija tea.

594
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,480
Is that the right?

595
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,570
It is.

596
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,530
Da Hae, can you make it?

597
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,530
Yes.

598
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,760
- Take it.
 -  Okay.

599
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,200
Let's call it a day. Good job, everyone.

600
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,100
Great job.

601
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,760
What's with you?

602
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,630
You were cold, then you became nice again.

603
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,840
What's the real you?

604
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,330
You're starting this again.

605
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,930
You should thank me first.

606
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,570
Oh, sure. Thanks.

607
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,630
I'm really thankful.

608
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,030
I'm so used to living alone,

609
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:29,260
so I feel thankful whenever I am treated nicely.

610
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,360
I was going to be strong here.

611
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,860
I shouldn't let my guard down.

612
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,930
Don't worry. You're doing fine.

613
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,330
I'm sure...

614
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,530
your father will be proud, too.

615
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,300
Let's not talk about that.

616
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,840
Didn't you tell your parents about getting promoted?

617
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,000
Stop it.

618
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,660
I'm sorry. I was really busy.

619
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,060
It's all right.

620
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,030
Aren't you hungry?

621
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,300
I am. I haven't had anything to eat.

622
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,330
I am not hungry.

623
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,510
You do understand that there were Goongnakwon's cheques...

624
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:58,100
among the cheques used by Mr Park when he gambled, right?

625
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,300
My friend once had...

626
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,160
a lighter from a club in Jeju Island.

627
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,700
But he's never been there.

628
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,230
If even lighters can cross the ocean,

629
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,400
why not a cheque?

630
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,000
Isn't it an abuse of authority to summon someone like me...

631
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,100
for an incident like this?

632
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,230
I caught the tail. So at least let me see what the body looks like.

633
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,860
And it's not an abuse of authority. I'm just doing my job.

634
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,400
When did you last meet Mr Park?

635
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,430
The last time was...

636
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,480
I'm not sure what you mean by the last time,

637
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,900
but frankly, I do not remember.

638
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,760
It's been so long.

639
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,160
This will take a while.

640
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,860
This will end late at night. You should call home and say,

641
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,100
"I'm not at a bar, so don't nag at me."

642
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,910
Is there another reason why you're doing this?

643
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:02,930
There is.

644
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,000
Don't ever think about using your connections again.

645
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,560
Next time you do, I will break off that connection for good.

646
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,560
Wow, you're scary.

647
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,800
I just got the chills.

648
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,830
I guess people really do rise up from a humble family.

649
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,030
You got all the way here from an orphanage.

650
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,660
Do you want to make a bet?

651
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,760
Ms Chae, you'll be removed from this case as of today.

652
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,400
So don't make this hard on me.

653
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,400
A prosecutor is...

654
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,960
an independent government administrative office.

655
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,200
You can't get to me.

656
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,230
I could get to a first-year prosecutor...

657
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:56,970
as much as I wanted to even 10 years ago.

658
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,100
Even someone like me.

659
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,260
Go to Ahyeon-dong.

660
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,380
- Mr Ahn.
 -  Recite...

661
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,400
the principle of uniformity.

662
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,150
Why do you want...

663
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,160
Recite it!

664
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,180
All prosecutors must obey prosecutors in a higher office...

665
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,410
with the Public Prosecutor General as the top office,

666
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,260
and all must work in uniformity.

667
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,030
Forget about this case,

668
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,330
and wait for another one.

669
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,060
I can't do that.

670
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,430
What?

671
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,170
I will investigate more into the cheques,

672
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,940
and I will also summon Mr Choi, who works for Mr Park.

673
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,580
Also, I will bring in Mr Ha for a second questioning...

674
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,600
Are you...

675
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,460
insane?

676
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,500
I'm glad...

677
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,630
you figured it out.

678
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,200
The chief said that...

679
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,730
I am a perfect candidate to work in this special branch...

680
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,100
because I have zero connections.

681
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,430
I should live up...

682
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,260
to his expectations.

683
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,130
Zero connections?

684
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,260
I know that you got here with your connections.

685
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,060
Who are you trying to fool?

686
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,030
Please take back what you said.

687
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,900
Remember this.

688
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,370
No matter how good your connection is,

689
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,400
no one can say anything about the orders of this institution.

690
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,900
Once the orders get destroyed, so will the institution.

691
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,860
You can try as much as you'd like.

692
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,230
Let's see what'll happen to you.

693
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:05,700
I will show you myself.

694
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,360
Don't ask a thing,

695
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,360
and jump right out when I tell you.

696
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,860
I already made the decision.

697
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,060
So don't make any decisions of your own.

698
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,230
Let me tell you again.

699
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,260
If you hesitate even for a second,

700
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,030
you'll be done with.

701
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,460
Do you understand?

702
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,530
It's what he gets for his beating.

703
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,800
I shut his mouth with a beating,

704
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,860
and I stop him...

705
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,030
from talking with money.

706
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,260
This is my way.

707
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,000
Make sure you beat him...

708
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,030
just until he can barely walk back home.

709
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Go.

710
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,660
Who are you?

711
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,300
What are you doing?

712
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,680
Oh my gosh.

713
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,700
Don't do this.

714
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,900
Spare me.

715
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,560
I'll give you anything you want.

716
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,530
Let's go.

717
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,800
I want to be left alone.

718
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,130
Just leave me.

719
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,760
Didn't you hear me?

720
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,010
Go away.

721
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,030
I didn't hear you.

722
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,410
So try screaming louder.

723
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,100
Get out of here!

724
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,530
Louder.

725
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:21,830
I can smell oil,

726
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,500
blood...

727
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,660
and...

728
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,630
old letters.

729
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,080
It smells like a piece of memory.

730
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,000
Thankfully, it still smells much stronger than the bad smells.

731
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,730
If I were you,

732
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,730
I'd quit before it gets worse.

733
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,960
Thank you.

734
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,300
Do you always hold girls' hands like this?

735
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,460
Do you always get away with this?

736
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Cheer up.

737
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,960
(To Park Tae Ha)

738
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,660
I will hold a contest in the noodles department.

739
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,200
Your opponent will be Deputy Head of Noodles.

740
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,700
It's impossible for you to become the head without a contest.

741
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,560
I'm sure you can definitely win against Deputy Head of Noodles.

742
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,430
How does it sound? Don't you think it's fair?

743
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,900
I accept.

744
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,370
You will begin appearing on TV shows...

745
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,530
after you become Head of Noodles.

746
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,370
All right, it's my turn now.

747
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,660
When can I meet...

748
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,610
Congressman So Tae Seop?

749
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,760
Declare...

750
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:44,730
the contest first.

751
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,600
I always...

752
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,260
keep my promises no matter what happens.

753
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,530
My promise to let someone live,

754
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,060
and my promise to kill, too.

755
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,930
How does tonight sound?

756
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,500
(Top Secret)

757
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,500
(Defence Industry Corruption)

758
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,360
Mr Choi...

759
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,730
got admitted to the hospital.

760
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,560
He said he fell down the stairs, but I doubt that.

761
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,800
So he can't come in for questioning?

762
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,180
- That's right.
 -  What happens if...

763
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,570
I go on investigating...

764
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:23,380
a case I was told to close and ignore?

765
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,110
You'll be suspended and disciplined for insubordination at least.

766
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,010
Also, it'll be difficult for you to survive in the organisation.

767
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:32,880
- What else?
 -  You might lose us, your staff.

768
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,980
And I'll probably waste my work hours away without a single case.

769
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,300
Or you could end up with dozens of cases a day.

770
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,960
Either way, you won't be able to survive.

771
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,130
I want some noodles.

772
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,430
What about you?

773
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,730
You know how crazy I am about noodles.

774
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,770
Hello, Sir.

775
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,130
Hey.

776
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,930
You were born to make noodles.

777
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,480
You look very nice.

778
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,530
Come inside.

779
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,200
Are you involved in any social movements?

780
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,630
Do whatever you want. Beat him up if you have to.

781
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,800
If you fail, I'll kill you.

782
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,730
Nice to meet you, Sir. I'm Ha Jung Tae.

783
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,330
I'm So Tae Seop.

784
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,800
Come with me.

785
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:04,800
A table for two? Come this way, please.

786
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,800
Forget the noodles. Get Mr Ha.

787
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,180
It's an honour to meet you.

788
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,230
It's an honour for me. I got to meet a famous chef.

789
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,630
Tae Ha, see what the problem is.

790
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,060
(Master of Revenge)

791
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,700
You know nothing.

792
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,930
You saw nothing.

793
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:48,130
My gut tells me that you're hiding something.

794
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,300
You always did anything I asked.

795
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,030
Quit working there.

796
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,830
Don't say you saw me.

797
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,000
It's best if we ignore each other.

798
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,000
Find out about Kim Gil Do.

799
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,030
You'll learn more about Ha Jung Tae.

800
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,060
It really exists.

801
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,730
In small amounts, it's a medicine.

802
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,800
In large amounts, it's a neurotoxin.

803
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,930
The old man.

804
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,830
Ha Jung Tae. Do you know why I'm here?
