1
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:03,113
Seo Yeon.

2
00:00:03,538 --> 00:00:05,173
Wake up.

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:06,683
Seo Yeon.

4
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,262
Mom...

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,393
It's okay.

6
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,393
Mom...

7
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:26,202
It's okay, Seo Yeon.

8
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:29,396
Dad...

9
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,472
It's okay, Seo Yeon.

10
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:36,512
Seo Yeon, listen up.

11
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,912
You...

12
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,283
You have to get out of here.

13
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:42,912
- Okay?
- Dad.

14
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:45,823
What about you?

15
00:00:46,248 --> 00:00:47,753
I'll be out soon too.

16
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:49,192
So...

17
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:53,522
you have to go first...

18
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:56,732
and get some help.

19
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,222
- Dad...
- Okay.

20
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:27,962
Seo Yeon.

21
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,793
Don't look at me.

22
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,962
Don't look at us and go.

23
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:37,203
Mom and Dad will be fine.

24
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:39,442
So don't...

25
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,313
Don't look back.

26
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,783
Can you promise me?

27
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:56,653
Good girl.

28
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:04,432
Okay. Go now.

29
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:18,272
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:20,212
I'm...

31
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:22,453
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:44,073
Seo Yeon.

33
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:45,842
Don't look back.

34
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:48,703
Don't look at us and go.

35
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:51,842
Mom and Dad...

36
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,943
will be fine.

37
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,152
So don't look back.

38
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:00,823
Can you promise me?

39
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,043
Help us.

40
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,152
Please help us.

41
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,002
What?

42
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:51,203
What do you...

43
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:53,902
What do you mean?

44
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,712
An accident?

45
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,342
Which hospital?

46
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:02,953
Okay.

47
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,522
What is it?

48
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,193
A car accident.

49
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:14,762
They got into a car accident.

50
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:16,233
What?

51
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:19,733
I'm not sure. Let's go.

52
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,283
My gosh, man.

53
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,423
That's so crazy.

54
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,892
My goodness.

55
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:50,793
What is it?

56
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:56,496
What are you doing?

57
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,226
Goodness, stop it.

58
00:04:58,227 --> 00:05:00,666
I don't remember what happened.

59
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,796
- What's with you?
- Who are you?

60
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,967
- Who do you think you are?
- My goodness!

61
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:06,043
Let him go!

62
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,207
What are you doing?

63
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,707
- Let him go!
- You! Hey! Let him go!

64
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,447
- Let him go!
- What are you doing?

65
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:13,976
Goodness, are you okay?

66
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:15,577
- I'm going to kill you!
- Stop it!

67
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:17,347
- What's with you?
- Stop it! Won Seok!

68
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,723
I'll beat him to death.

69
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:20,322
Won Seok!

70
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:40,637
Are you a thug or what?

71
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,007
Handle it by the law!

72
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,353
- Just deal with it by the law!
- Shut your mouth.

73
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,952
If you say another word,

74
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,223
I'll kill you.

75
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,762
How's Seo Yeon?

76
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:00,333
She doesn't remember yet.

77
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,403
You should see our father...

78
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:08,872
one last time too.

79
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:21,552
I can't.

80
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,052
I can't do that.

81
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:28,793
How can I see him?

82
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:32,863
How...

83
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,103
How can I see him?

84
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,197
I was supposed to feel guilty,

85
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:46,882
sad, and angry.

86
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:48,973
But I dumped it on my older brothers...

87
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:53,783
Mom...

88
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,262
and my baby brother,

89
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,963
and lived in oblivion.

90
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,182
Going out for a run?

91
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:33,062
It's not that we didn't tell you on purpose...

92
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:41,762
I understand why you did that.

93
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,343
I'm going for a run.

94
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:53,012
It's not your fault.

95
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,353
It's not your fault.

96
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,853
Don't get any weird ideas.

97
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:13,233
She definitely thinks everything is her fault, right?

98
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,002
Man, it's all over.

99
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:21,103
What's going on?

100
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:23,838
What's over?

101
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,407
Why are you up already?

102
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:28,042
Go to sleep. Go back to sleep.

103
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,483
What's going on?

104
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,333
I'm in here, so don't turn off the lights.

105
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:21,103
Joo Hee.

106
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:23,502
Did I wake you up?

107
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,742
Are all parents...

108
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,313
like that?

109
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:38,408
What?

110
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:40,353
Are they willing...

111
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,752
to sacrifice themselves for their kids?

112
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,563
Can they die in their kids' place?

113
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:49,122
Well...

114
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:51,762
I think so.

115
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,902
Are your parents like that too?

116
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,172
I don't remember much about my dad.

117
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:04,172
But my mom was like that.

118
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:08,183
In order to leave as much money as possible for my sister and me,

119
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,512
she worked at a restaurant until the day before she passed away.

120
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:15,853
She passed away?

121
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:17,823
Yes.

122
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,463
She was very ill.

123
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,303
Why did you ask that all of a sudden?

124
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,042
I didn't know parents were like that.

125
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,742
I had no idea.

126
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,992
I'm sure we'll get along just fine.

127
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,563
Everything will turn out fine.

128
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:01,987
I'll come with you.

129
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:05,402
I need to see this guy who's giving you so much trouble.

130
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,103
Wake up.

131
00:11:08,898 --> 00:11:10,073
Seo Yeon.

132
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,772
Dad...

133
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,512
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,012
Mom and Dad will be fine.

135
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:20,953
Don't look back.

136
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,223
Can you promise me?

137
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:43,613
(Lee Kang Woo)

138
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:58,152
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

139
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:00,292
Is she still sleeping?

140
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,283
My heart was too fluttering for me to sleep well.

141
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:06,056
My gosh.

142
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,833
I'm going to take you to school!

143
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:18,813
What? Mr. Chief Director.

144
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:20,642
"Mister"?

145
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:25,782
Hey, I'm the same age as your sister.

146
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,183
Where is she?

147
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:31,892
- She went to school.
- Already?

148
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:36,916
- Sir.
- Don't address me like that!

149
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,492
Are you dating her?

150
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:40,902
"Dating"?

151
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:46,466
Well... I guess so.

152
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,542
Why?

153
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,537
You're rich and handsome, so why?

154
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:54,183
I guess you're too young to be aware of her charms.

155
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:58,782
But then again, it'd be really weird...

156
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,223
if you knew them.

157
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:03,122
Anyway...

158
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,093
I hope we get along well, my dear brother-in-law.

159
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,223
"Brother-in-law"?

160
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:11,863
Do you want a ride?

161
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:16,473
Yes.

162
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,473
Yes!

163
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:21,642
You're so simple-minded.

164
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,183
- Get out.
- What?

165
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,093
Here? Aren't you coming?

166
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,223
Are you not going to work?

167
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,617
- No.
- Why not?

168
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,703
Just because.

169
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:51,272
Have you been sacked?

170
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,267
Are you jobless?

171
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:55,603
No! Go tell your sister to come out!

172
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,607
I don't want her to date someone jobless.

173
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,206
Why would she date someone jobless?

174
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,652
Hey, that's not true. I'm not jobless!

175
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,382
What a rude brat!

176
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,723
Seo Yeon.

177
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:18,233
The ex-chief director is waiting in front of the school.

178
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,902
By the way,

179
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:24,502
I thought you hated good-looking men.

180
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,943
Go, now. He's waiting for you.

181
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:32,772
Okay.

182
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:34,843
Go to class.

183
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,053
Seo Jun.

184
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:51,363
I'm sorry.

What's wrong with her?

188
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,983
Gosh.

189
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:15,723
Do I look okay?

190
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:18,752
Hey!

191
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:23,492
What are you doing here?

192
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,792
I heard there was a suspicious car.

193
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,757
I came to check whether it was a pervert or not.

194
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,063
"Pervert"?

195
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:30,973
Who said that?

196
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:34,166
Are you protesting since you've been sacked?

197
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,103
No, I'm here to see Seo Yeon.

198
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,943
It's her.

199
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,983
Let's meet next time. I'm busy right now.

200
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,093
Move your car right now.

201
00:15:57,988 --> 00:15:59,863
I wish I worked here as well.

202
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:38,703
Did the ex-chief director leave?

203
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:41,527
Yes, he just did.

204
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:44,466
Was he that obedient?

205
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,483
With that temper of his, he must've put up a fight.

206
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,176
I mean, it's nothing much.

207
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,453
It wasn't anything intentional.

208
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:58,716
But we told the chairwoman...

209
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,046
- a bit about him.
- A tiny bit.

210
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:04,056
- Yes, just a little bit.
- Just this much.

211
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,333
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

212
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:09,727
Why didn't she appoint such a wonderful man like you...

213
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,273
from the start?

214
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:14,467
Why did she appoint Kang Woo?

215
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:15,826
I know, right?

216
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,672
- I just can't understand.
- Me neither.

217
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,743
Anyway, we'll go now.

218
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,083
Thank you, sir.

219
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:26,882
Goodness.

220
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:28,823
All right.

221
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,717
- Thank you, sir.
- You never know what will happen.

222
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,162
Wait up.

223
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:50,412
I'm sure Aunt didn't do anything just yet.

224
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,682
What are you doing?

225
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,017
I need to take care of my own son.

226
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:06,722
Min Hyuk is whom you cherish the most.

227
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:12,787
Are you sulking because I removed Kang Woo from his position?

228
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:14,533
Yes, you're right.

229
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:18,826
Can you really not trust him?

230
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:22,073
He's never proven himself.

231
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:25,796
Exactly. That's exactly why...

232
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:28,113
I'll be taking care of him from now on.

233
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,682
And is your definition of that scheduling his blind date?

234
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,892
There are so many wonderful women out there, so why?

235
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,222
What?

236
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:58,796
Why is your wife so upset? Why?

237
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:01,037
Is it because I'm bringing Kang Woo into the headquarters?

238
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:02,707
No, it's not that.

239
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,906
Kang Woo must be dating someone.

240
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:07,947
- What?
- That's why she's been so mad.

241
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,546
What kind of girl is she?

242
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:10,876
- I don't know either.
- Who is she?

243
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:12,177
- Hear me out, Mom.
- Okay.

244
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:14,217
You and I should be on the same team.

245
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:15,816
And if we help Kang Woo,

246
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,957
- Kang Woo will get...
- Mi Ja!

247
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,356
- Mi Ja!
- What is it?

248
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,687
- What are you doing, Mom?
- What's this all about?

249
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:23,027
- Stop it, Mom.
- Mi Ja.

250
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,503
Oh, no. This is awful.

251
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:26,497
I made this worse.

252
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,396
Kang Woo. I should tell him.

253
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:30,836
Mom. Mom! Goodness.

254
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,306
The water. The water is boiling. Hold on.

255
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:35,437
It's boiling. Wait. Where is that thing?

256
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:36,912
Goodness.

257
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:44,293
You are indeed talented.

258
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,717
Gosh. I can picture...

259
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,063
Park Seok Min and Hi-Seven in these outfits.

260
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,392
Gosh, the smell of money.

261
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:58,202
What's on your mind?

262
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:00,227
We shared our feelings...

263
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:01,803
and had a good time.

264
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:03,412
We even went on a date.

265
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:06,013
How could she not call me back the next day?

266
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:07,982
Is it about Seo Yeon?

267
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,277
Hey, she's not like you.

268
00:20:10,278 --> 00:20:11,537
She must be in class.

269
00:20:11,538 --> 00:20:14,346
What's she doing during her breaks? What about her lunchtime?

270
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,816
Texting me or giving me a call isn't that hard.

271
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,717
- How many times did you reach out?
- 10 times.

272
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,116
You sent 10 text messages?

273
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,447
No, I called 10 times. I sent 20 text messages.

274
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:23,863
How sickening.

275
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,656
Gosh, how sickening.

276
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,356
- Sickening?
- Come on. Know when to stop.

277
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:30,232
She'll get sick of you and run to the hills before this goes anywhere.

278
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:32,902
Is that what happened?

279
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:35,573
(Idiot)

280
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:38,513
Gosh, he's so sickening.

281
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:43,353
Hyun Soo keeps calling me.

282
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:48,152
I guess Hyun Soo really likes you.

283
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,493
It's hard to resist my charms once men fall for me.

284
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,192
I'm like a swamp.

285
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,757
What's wrong? You don't like him at all?

286
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,833
Well,

287
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:02,202
he's not a bad guy by nature,

288
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,352
but I'm not sure. Something doesn't feel right.

289
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,273
I could tell he has a lot of women around him.

290
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:10,843
And I don't feel comfortable...

291
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,142
because his label is bigger than I thought.

292
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,406
I thought you were interested in men's assets.

293
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,613
Now that I see a man with assets beyond my expectations,

294
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:20,583
I do feel a bit intimidated as I'm only human.

295
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:23,207
I don't want men who are richer than me by 10 places.

296
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,823
3 to 4 places higher would be perfect for me.

297
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:32,017
I'm talking about me. That's just me.

298
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:34,462
This has nothing to do with you and Kang Woo, right?

299
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,596
Hey, I'm getting hungry.

300
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,592
Let's go steal some food from the Health Office.

301
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:42,603
- No, I don't want to.
- What? Why not?

302
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,543
Just because.

303
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:48,412
He's not the school doctor anymore. He's the chief director now.

304
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:50,853
We can't be casual like before.

305
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,783
I don't believe it.

306
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:57,692
Did Mr. Lee finally...

307
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,273
Seo Yeon won't come here now.

308
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:17,396
Even if you prepare snacks for her,

309
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:20,113
she won't be coming here anymore, Mr. Chief Director.

310
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,543
Why not?

311
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:22,707
Do you have to ask?

312
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,412
Why were you confident enough to confess your feelings to her?

313
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:28,406
Don't get the wrong idea.

314
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:31,046
You know that she's not the type to discuss this with other people.

315
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:32,853
I catch on really quickly. That's all.

316
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:36,962
Was it your confidence or arrogance?

317
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:39,563
My stubbornness.

318
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:41,232
I thought so.

319
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:43,732
It's not just anyone. It's Kang Woo.

320
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,033
You guys are cousins.

321
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:49,472
Stop pursuing her, so Seo Yeon doesn't feel uncomfortable.

322
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,442
I'm not sure.

323
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:05,793
I'm a bit selfish.

324
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:08,673
I don't like it when things go well for other people.

325
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,833
Gosh. That line with that face. That was super cool.

326
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:26,212
Goodness, does he have his phone glued to him all day?

327
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:29,212
What?

328
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:34,346
What is it? Talk. You called me.

329
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:36,076
I didn't know you'd actually pick up.

330
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:37,747
I called you out of habit.

331
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:39,753
Are you kidding me?

332
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:41,816
- Bye.
- Let's have a meal.

333
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,962
Have a meal with me.

334
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:47,132
Come to think of it, we never had a meal together.

335
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,533
No.

336
00:23:49,488 --> 00:23:51,702
- Why not?
- Then, we'll be friends.

337
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,573
What?

338
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,197
Seriously? She asked me to buy her a meal a while ago.

339
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:01,737
Gosh. She doesn't like money or food. What am I supposed to do?

340
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:04,513
That little munchkin. She's so cute.

341
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:10,152
Good morning. Hello, Seo Yeon. Aren't you on your break now?

342
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:12,422
Did you eat? Did you eat a lot?

343
00:24:13,547 --> 00:24:15,162
I guess you're very busy.

344
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:17,063
I want to see you.

345
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:19,263
Call me after you finish work!

346
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,326
(Lee Kang Woo)

347
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:30,212
(Lee Kang Woo)

348
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:34,343
(Lee Kang Woo)

349
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,952
I caught you at the right time.

350
00:24:53,587 --> 00:24:57,232
It looks like you really need these guys.

351
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:09,142
- Well...
- As you know,

352
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,182
I don't have a lot of friends because I'm wary of people.

353
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:15,122
You probably figured that out at the meeting.

354
00:25:22,117 --> 00:25:23,962
Can't you eat with me?

355
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:29,962
I'll just eat.

356
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:03,132
As you can see, this happened.

357
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:05,497
Well, good for you.

358
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,843
This is all thanks to your hard work.

359
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:10,027
You told me to face my trauma...

360
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,872
to overcome my trauma.

361
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,442
Thanks to that advice, I met Seo Yeon again.

362
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:20,013
Then, I don't think you need to come in again after today.

363
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,952
But you see,

364
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,363
how am I supposed to date a woman?

365
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:37,432
Dating is not my area of expertise. However,

366
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:41,273
all of our psychological problems have one source.

367
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:44,543
What's the problem?

368
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,142
Which one should I ask you first?

369
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:50,553
Take your time.

370
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:22,642
(Management)

371
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,053
It's Seo Yeon.

372
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:38,993
At the bus stop...

373
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:41,503
Why didn't you take the bus?

374
00:27:42,258 --> 00:27:43,833
I just walked home.

375
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,356
Did you wait for me at the bus stop?

376
00:27:45,357 --> 00:27:47,543
No. Why would we?

377
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:49,503
We were exercising.

378
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,937
We met you here by chance.

379
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,667
Let's pretend that we did and have a drink.

380
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:56,482
Yes. Let's have a drink.

381
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,613
What? A drink?

382
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:06,275
(Episode 22 will air shortly.)

383
00:28:06,983 --> 00:29:08,809
(Ads 00:28:06 --> 00:29:08)

384
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:25,684
(Episode 22)

385
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:31,885
We're sorry we didn't tell you before.

386
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:37,095
I was 15 back then.

387
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,835
If I had known at that time,

388
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:42,595
I probably couldn't bear it.

389
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,470
I know that you two did it...

390
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,414
because you were worried about me and wanted to protect me.

391
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,145
Thank you.

392
00:29:57,239 --> 00:30:00,115
Seo Yeon, you're all grown up.

393
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,984
I was worried...

394
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,494
that you would hate and blame us for not telling you.

395
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,425
Won Jae, are you crying?

396
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,295
I'm not. Who's crying?

397
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,960
Don't cry.

398
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,435
I'm not.

399
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,435
I'm not crying.

400
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:23,244
Let him be. He's in full menopause.

401
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:30,184
(Craft Beer)

402
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,884
You know,

403
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:38,985
I know you're all grown up,

404
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,194
but do you have to drink when I'm around?

405
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,524
I drank often around Won Seok.

406
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,964
I'm a regular at his place.

407
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,035
You should be stopping her instead of giving her drinks.

408
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,205
She's a better drinker than you.

409
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,145
No way.

410
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:03,044
You should learn to drink from me.

411
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:14,625
Our farewell is here already

412
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,735
Do not cry even if you are sad

413
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,760
- Yesterday, I cried - Will you be quiet?

414
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,359
Won Jae can't drink at all.

415
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,299
He doesn't live up to his build.

416
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:31,474
I'm sorry! My dear Seo Yeon.

417
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,600
I'm sorry.

418
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,899
- Quiet. - Hey!

419
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:38,040
Without a heart that hate, hate

420
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
- Hate you - What's going on?

421
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,239
I was wondering who's being so noisy,

422
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:44,054
- and it's you, Won Jae. - Hey.

423
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,585
My dear baby brother.

424
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,479
My little puppy.

425
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,280
- I'm sorry! - Smells.

426
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,220
- Why? - Hey, you take him.

427
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,290
You're heavy.

428
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,989
My dear, Seo Jun. I'm sorry.

429
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:58,229
- Why did he drink so much? - I'm sorry!

430
00:31:58,229 --> 00:31:59,389
- My gosh. - Will you be quiet?

431
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:02,399
Without a heart that hate, hate, hate you

432
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,504
Stop being so loud! Darn it.

433
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,175
What?

434
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,645
Hey.

435
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,070
That's Seo Yeon's boyfriend.

436
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,145
What?

437
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,485
You should go in.

438
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,195
Let me introduce myself once again.

439
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,064
I am Lee Kang Woo.

440
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,934
Go inside.

441
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,199
- Hey, that guy... - Come on.

442
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,769
- honked at me. - Be quiet.

443
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:41,100
- He honked at me! - I told you to be quiet.

444
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,385
I'm going to kill him if he does that again.

445
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,485
You're getting kind of annoying.

446
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,855
Won Seok.

447
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,374
What's going on, Seo Yeon?

448
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:15,575
Is your phone out of battery?

449
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:16,744
Is it broken?

450
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,925
Never mind, I'm sure something happened.

451
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,495
Wait, did you...

452
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:37,604
already get sick of me?

453
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,245
I'm sorry, Kang Woo.

454
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:54,010
No, it's okay.

455
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,714
I'm not that angry.

456
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,195
So why were you out of touch the whole day?

457
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:40,895
Because I would want to see you if I heard your voice.

458
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,364
Don't you think you like me a bit too much?

459
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:46,805
Hold your horses.

460
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,329
No, never mind. I take that back.

461
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:52,305
Like me so much that I drive you crazy.

462
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,745
Completely.

463
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,815
Okay?

464
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,010
You're heavy.

465
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,480
Stay there even if I'm heavy.

466
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,924
You're a woman who can bear this much weight.

467
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,024
My dear Kang Woo.

468
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:14,094
What did you...

469
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,534
just say? Did you just say...

470
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:19,664
"my dear Kang Woo"?

471
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,575
If I...

472
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,674
become really mean to you,

473
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,315
you should hate me a lot.

474
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,515
- What? - You should cuss at me...

475
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,114
and blame me, okay?

476
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,654
Don't hold yourself back.

477
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,385
Okay?

478
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:40,854
Okay?

479
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,104
No matter how mean you are to me,

480
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:55,135
the moment you say,

481
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,604
"my dear Kang Woo",

482
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,614
everything will be fine.

483
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,255
So when you're heartbroken...

484
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,885
or angry,

485
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,555
you can take out everything on me.

486
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:14,424
Everything.

487
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,895
I won't bother you like this again.

488
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,505
Call me when you have time.

489
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,459
I'll hold myself back even if I want to hear your voice...

490
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:30,404
or even if I miss you.

491
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:33,674
I'll wait patiently.

492
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,815
Go inside.

493
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,585
I'll see you off first.

494
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:40,255
Okay, then.

495
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,154
Bye.

496
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,205
Goodbye.

497
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:19,724
Are you dating him again?

498
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,594
No.

499
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,565
You aren't dating him again?

500
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:28,594
Is it him?

501
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,864
The boy...

502
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,435
that you went to see with Mom and Dad on that night.

503
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,875
Your middle school friend...

504
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,774
that you wronged in the past.

505
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,075
It's him, isn't it?

506
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,214
Are you okay?

507
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:47,455
When things get tough,

508
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,655
please help me out, Won Seok.

509
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:53,085
Anytime.

510
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:04,905
That easily?

511
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:14,744
She's pretending to be okay, isn't she?

512
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:16,275
You're sober already?

513
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,545
I get drunk quickly, and I sober up quickly too.

514
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:26,955
Keep your eyes on her!

515
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:29,695
Things look very dangerous for her right now!

516
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,805
You weren't asleep yet?

517
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:45,874
Don't worry.

518
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:47,545
I'll protect you.

519
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,844
They have the same facial features.

520
00:39:56,899 --> 00:39:58,514
It's the same guy.

521
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:04,055
I asked them to go.

522
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,285
It's because of me.

523
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,955
They passed away because of me.

524
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,295
Because of me.

525
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,835
Seo Yeon.

526
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,575
It's because of me.

527
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,004
They passed away because of me.

528
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:27,874
No, it's because of him.

529
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:36,315
He's the grandson of Shinhwa Food?

530
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:43,295
What do you do when you have free time?

531
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:47,494
Answer me.

532
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:48,689
What?

533
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:50,634
What do you do when you have free time?

534
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:54,230
What was that for?

535
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,634
I heard you got sacked...

536
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,799
and will be working at the headquarters.

537
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:00,470
That's the report for the last quarter.

538
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,639
- Read that. - Why would I?

539
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,269
You know what I'm doing.

540
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:05,415
And are you doing that right now?

541
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,109
How could you have free time when you're working on that?

542
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,740
You must be taking it easy.

543
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,950
Since you said you didn't want any of my money,

544
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,649
I thought you were taking it seriously.

545
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:15,224
I mean...

546
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,720
I wasn't talking about my working time.

547
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,295
Who was that woman last time at the police station?

548
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,305
- It's someone I like. - Which family? Name?

549
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,335
Joo family's only daughter among many sons.

550
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:32,545
I may be able to do that, but not you.

551
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,415
I can pick whoever I want, but not you.

552
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:36,899
What do you mean?

553
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:40,514
Can you introduce her to Mom and Grandma this instant?

554
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:43,085
- Of course. - You're so selfish.

555
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,384
What do you have?

556
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:48,149
Have you proven yourself regarding your work?

557
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:49,825
Are you financially independent?

558
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,689
Being so reckless could hurt her.

559
00:41:53,689 --> 00:41:55,620
Don't underestimate Mom.

560
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,559
When it comes to her children, she's stronger than anyone else.

561
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,935
Especially if it's concerning you.

562
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:12,744
Kang Woo.

563
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,955
No, you're right. You made me realize it.

564
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,984
You're right.

565
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,220
You don't need to comfort me.

566
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,394
What do you mean?

567
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,864
- Pick that up. - What?

568
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:29,665
What? Okay.

569
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,714
I'm all for it.

570
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,214
No matter who you pick, I support you completely.

571
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,285
So please do the same for me.

572
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,185
Deal?

573
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:55,025
Deal.

574
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,239
Sir, are you waiting for someone's call?

575
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,955
No. Don't be ridiculous.

576
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,864
I should've dropped her in front of her house.

577
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:33,935
Did she trip on her way home?

578
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:43,134
What if she busted her knees?

579
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,175
Lee Kang Hee speaking.

580
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,644
Are you okay?

581
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:52,984
What?

582
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,455
Mr. Joo Won Jae?

583
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,994
Did you go home safely that night?

584
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:02,594
Of course.

585
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:07,835
I thought something happened since you didn't call.

586
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,620
Have you been waiting?

587
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,165
What? Not really.

588
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:16,205
Do you want to have dinner?

589
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:20,740
If you already have plans, then we could take a rain check.

590
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,714
I have no plans.

591
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:25,984
I didn't make any because I was waiting for your call.

592
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:30,109
Whenever and wherever. From 6pm to 12am.

593
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,754
We've made a deal.

594
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:33,754
You're a hardworking employee.

595
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:36,350
I'm glad we've made a deal.

596
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,689
Of course. I'm like no other.

597
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:42,695
I'm quite competent, you see.

598
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:49,504
So...

599
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:52,104
I'll see you later tonight.

600
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,484
I'm so embarrassed.

601
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,754
Did you have to go on and on like that?

602
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,325
I'll see you later, Mr. Joo.

603
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:16,295
You're so selfish.

604
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,604
What do you have?

605
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,305
Have you proven yourself regarding your work?

606
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,205
Okay!

607
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,724
Let's meet in the evening. I have something to...

608
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,224
(Let's meet in the evening. I have something to...)

609
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,594
My gosh.

610
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,994
Who are you?

611
00:45:52,995 --> 00:45:57,995
<font color="#8080ff">[VIU Ver] MBC E22 'Love with Flaws'</font> 
<font color="#ff8080">"Seo Yeon's Decision"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

612
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:05,144
Aunt?

613
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,319
I knew you were Mr. Lee's aunt.

614
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,994
But I couldn't connect the dots and think you were Kang Woo's mom.

615
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:22,065
Welcome.

616
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,374
Come to think of it, I saw you last time as well.

617
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:34,975
I'm such a fool. What a fool.

618
00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:41,684
By the way, what brings you here?

619
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:49,025
I heard you're dating my son.

620
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,525
- What? - Don't be so startled.

621
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,164
Did you think I'd never find out?

622
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,434
I'll make it short.

623
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,805
Break up with him.

624
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,204
You shouldn't underestimate our family.

625
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:10,344
I understand that it'll be difficult to end things with him.

626
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:14,715
That's why I'm going to make it easier for you.

627
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,454
Okay, I'll do that.

628
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,664
I'm sorry for making you concerned.

629
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:35,275
I mean...

630
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:47,144
What? That was too easy.

631
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,124
I'd prepared 10 envelopes.

632
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:02,465
She didn't even take a look.

633
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,055
This place is cozier than I had thought.

634
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:34,735
Are you okay?

635
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:39,505
I saw my aunt.

636
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:43,775
Don't worry.

637
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:47,344
Kang Woo will never let go of you.

638
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,444
That is, unless you let go of him first.

639
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,255
He won't...

640
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,954
unless I give up first, right?

641
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,965
Right. He won't give up on you first.

642
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,235
Right. Please don't tell Mi Kyung about this.

643
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,134
It will upset her.

644
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:17,075
Okay. Don't worry.

645
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,844
Thank you.

646
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:28,315
I'm always grateful.

647
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,315
Mother, what if Kang Woo finds out?

648
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,440
You should have stopped her.

649
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Goodness. I had no choice given the family she comes from.

650
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,255
You also heard what Mr. Kim said.

651
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:03,910
She lost her parents early in life...

652
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,150
and have half brothers.

653
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,950
Goodness.

654
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,825
Once he finds out, he'll be furious.

655
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,450
You know that Kang Woo can be even more stubborn than Kang Hee...

656
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,190
if he doesn't like something.

657
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,930
That's why I just need to keep your mouth shut.

658
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,359
Mom, I have a meeting to attend to.

659
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:21,735
- Sit down. - Okay.

660
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,775
Hand me your cellphone.

661
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:27,599
- Pardon? - Until his problem is sorted out,

662
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,299
I'll keep your phone.

663
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:31,339
Mom, I'm a working businessman.

664
00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:32,769
I get a lot of work calls.

665
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:33,869
Now.

666
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:35,285
But still.

667
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,849
I must get some calls related to work.

668
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:38,924
Goodness.

669
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,884
Honey.

670
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:42,854
What happened?

671
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,289
I'm not sure if she's bold...

672
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:46,890
or stupid.

673
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,394
What do you mean?

674
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:50,965
She won't break up with him?

675
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,690
No.

676
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,500
She obediently said that she would.

677
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,604
What?

678
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,704
How many envelopes did you give her?

679
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:05,809
None.

680
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:06,985
What?

681
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:16,154
Look who's here.

682
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,394
Is it because you're the chief director?

683
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:20,394
You got off work early.

684
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,235
You're not a better chief director than me.

685
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,335
You look good.

686
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,500
I came by just in case.

687
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,575
So you really have no idea.

688
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:35,914
What are you talking about?

689
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,215
You don't know even if someone next to you is in pain...

690
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:41,315
or is about to die.

691
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:45,954
What?

692
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:47,854
Do you know...

693
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,265
what doctors must be the most careful about in the OR?

694
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,995
Pride.

695
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,934
Even a doctor who performed the surgery hundreds of times...

696
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,990
will make a mistake the moment he feels proud...

697
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,374
of his competency.

698
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:04,299
It won't be that bad...

699
00:52:04,299 --> 00:52:06,204
if the doctor admits his mistake and walks out.

700
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:09,444
But once he begins to be stubborn about it, it becomes a problem.

701
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:16,914
What is your point?

702
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:20,654
Don't let your guard down.

703
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:23,924
If you make a mistake,

704
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,065
I will never waste that chance.

705
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,644
Seriously? You already got off work?

706
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:43,644
She's been MIA the whole day too.

707
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,285
Darn it.

708
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,325
Jung Ho, why didn't you come to practice today?

709
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:56,995
I told the dance teacher that you were sick.

710
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:00,565
Call me as soon as you get this.

711
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,975
Who are you? Why are you...

712
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,114
Joo Hee?

713
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,215
Look at you.

714
00:53:39,789 --> 00:53:41,700
What? No tutoring lesson today again?

715
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,104
What? No.

716
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,005
Ho Dol texted me.

717
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,215
Won Seok, did you see Joo Hee just now?

718
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,944
Why does she look like that?

719
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,644
- What do you mean? - I mean...

720
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,055
Joo Hee didn't look like herself.

721
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:57,339
How is she supposed to look then?

722
00:53:57,339 --> 00:53:58,725
Do you have to ask?

723
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:00,750
Sneakers, pants, and short hair.

724
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,654
But she was wearing makeup and a skirt.

725
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,594
Forget it.

726
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,990
What did your tutor say?

727
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,005
- What? - Why couldn't he make it?

728
00:54:13,029 --> 00:54:15,434
He just said he couldn't.

729
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,335
Is he sick or something?

730
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,619
These babies must be so suffocated here.

731
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:37,924
When they look at other cars, racing on the street,

732
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:39,364
they must be jealous, right?

733
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:42,194
Do you feel suffocated...

734
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:44,265
in your office too?

735
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,104
I'm hungry.

736
00:54:52,629 --> 00:54:53,704
Come here.

737
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,715
Take a seat.

738
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:01,315
These are new. So don't worry and put them on.

739
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:08,025
Thank you.

740
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,555
What did you have for lunch?

741
00:55:09,819 --> 00:55:11,990
I just had a glass of milk.

742
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,924
I had a feeling.

743
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:18,460
This looks really good.

744
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,089
I've been to a lot of restaurants because I do sales.

745
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:23,204
This restaurant serves the most authentic home-cooked meal.

746
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:24,944
You bought the meal for me?

747
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,529
Well, I'm sure...

748
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:30,015
other guys probably already took you to fancy restaurants.

749
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,010
I just wanted you to have a meal comfortably...

750
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,215
even if it's just a meal.

751
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:34,884
Here.

752
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,825
Not really.

753
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,579
- You don't feel comfortable? - I've been...

754
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:45,825
to expensive and fancy restaurants before.

755
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:48,720
But I haven't been there with men.

756
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,795
Why not?

757
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,864
You must have dated a lot of men.

758
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:53,434
38?

759
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:00,374
You dated 38 men.

760
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,299
For 38 years,

761
00:56:03,299 --> 00:56:05,644
I have never officially dated a man.

762
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:09,215
I've gone on a few blind dates.

763
00:56:09,879 --> 00:56:12,654
But I had to study, learn about the company,

764
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:14,255
and work.

765
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,924
This really does taste like a home-cooked meal.

766
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,414
Won Seok.

767
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,114
Won Seok. Did you see this?

768
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,450
Why are you here again?

769
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:46,924
I thought your label stopped you from coming here.

770
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,420
As if!

771
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,624
Do you know how much money I bring in for the company?

772
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:53,525
Listen, Won Seok. Did you watch this?

773
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,134
This is totally crazy.

774
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,164
Shall we date?

775
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,599
(A Gay Getting Outed in Real-Time)

776
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:04,829
- I can't believe this. - No way.

777
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:06,430
- What's this? - I didn't know this about you.

778
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,970
I don't know. This dummy got outed...

779
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,170
which is really unfortunate for him.

780
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,240
Will you keep this up? What is it?

781
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,069
This is priceless. Smile for me.

782
00:57:13,069 --> 00:57:14,609
- Ho Dol. - Just say it.

783
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:16,985
Did you really think I'd be like you?

784
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:21,180
Something is definitely up with Seo Yeon.

785
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,180
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

786
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,624
See? She's not answering her phone.

787
00:57:25,789 --> 00:57:28,789
Yes. I came all the way to the last transmission location.

788
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:30,594
Let me look into this and call you back.

789
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,005
Excuse me.

790
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:39,174
Have you seen a woman like this around here?

791
00:57:40,629 --> 00:57:42,315
No. I have not.

792
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:45,114
Okay.

793
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,585
But who are you?

794
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,585
I'm a police officer.

795
00:57:53,049 --> 00:57:54,124
Bye.

796
00:57:58,589 --> 00:58:01,694
No way. Why is the police officer looking for Baek Jang Mi?

797
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,604
What on earth is happening at this house?

798
00:58:12,629 --> 00:58:14,204
I'm a crazy woman.

799
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:19,144
I'll be the only crazy one.

800
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,715
Just me.

801
00:58:27,279 --> 00:58:28,525
Didn't I do a good job?

802
00:58:28,779 --> 00:58:30,255
I didn't bother you, right?

803
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,720
I thought about you only a bit...

804
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,420
and worked a lot.

805
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,565
Wasn't I good?

806
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,005
Yes, you were.

807
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,475
What's wrong?

808
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:51,914
Did something happen?

809
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,715
How much is this house?

810
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:57,640
- What? - Are you the owner?

811
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,354
Oh, it's registered under my name.

812
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:13,704
And all these things are yours?

813
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:16,005
I guess so.

814
00:59:31,879 --> 00:59:33,485
Won Jae has a suit from this brand too.

815
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:36,220
He has great taste.

816
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,164
He's probably still paying it back because he bought it over 36 months.

817
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,194
You paid for it at once, didn't you?

818
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,835
Yes.

819
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,184
You really are awfully rich, Kang Woo.

820
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:07,684
What's wrong?

821
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,755
I suddenly realized it.

822
01:00:11,379 --> 01:00:12,495
Realize what?

823
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:18,704
Your place and my place.

824
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:22,674
- What? - I had forgotten...

825
01:00:23,629 --> 01:00:25,245
that you're the grandson of Shinhwa Food.

826
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,315
Why did I forget that?

827
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:32,184
Don't I seem really stupid?

828
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:36,285
It doesn't make any sense for you and me to be together.

829
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,225
Do you know why my brothers and I don't look alike?

830
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,124
They aren't my biological brothers.

831
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,025
As you know, both of my parents...

832
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,005
have passed away too.

833
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:56,874
I'm an orphan. An orphan.

834
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,745
What are you doing right now?

835
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,515
Need I explain more?

836
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,854
You're making me feel kind of miserable.

837
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:16,124
Let's call this off while it's not too deep.

838
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,549
Not too deep?

839
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:19,650
It's obvious.

840
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:22,465
I'll suffer from more damage if I date you any longer.

841
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:25,965
Were you...

842
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:29,374
counting numbers while you were dating me?

843
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,134
You have no idea.

844
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,144
You've never been the one who has less power.

845
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:38,344
So Kang Woo,

846
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:41,785
- let's break up. - Seo Yeon!

847
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,225
What's wrong, Seo Yeon?

848
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:48,755
What is it?

849
01:02:00,129 --> 01:02:03,005
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

850
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,505
Don't say that, Seo Yeon.

851
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,545
You have a guest with you.

852
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:21,585
Who are you?

853
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,094
Pardon?

854
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,025
Are you Kang Woo's girlfriend?

855
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,664
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

856
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:42,114
Why? You are. You're my woman.

857
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:06,904
(Love with Flaws)

858
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,099
She doesn't like you because you're handsome, then you're too ugly,

859
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:10,799
and now it's because you're a grandson of a rich woman?

860
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:11,970
Enough is enough!

861
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:12,970
I got you!

862
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:14,099
Who are you?

863
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:15,500
I'll protect Seo Yeon.

864
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,670
What if I don't need anything else but her?

865
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,710
Do you think that's crazy?

866
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,039
Whatever. I'm getting kind of sulky.

867
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:21,539
I'm going to kill myself.

868
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:23,480
Don't cry. Please don't cry.

869
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,939
Just toy me around, then abandon me.

870
01:03:24,939 --> 01:03:26,950
Get a hold of yourself. You seem crazy.

871
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:28,620
Kang Woo is bleeding to death.

872
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,580
Why do you get scared and give up on me?

873
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,065
I don't love you.
