140
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:07,159

146
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:31,999
<font color="yellow">The plane crashed, and we're the only survivors?</font>

153

154
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:20,429
<font color="yellow">What happened to the others?</font>

155
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:35,129
<font color="yellow">They were not just celebrities.</font>

156
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:39,159
<font color="yellow">They were my family whom I have shared joys and sorrows...</font>

157

161
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,659
<font color="yellow">I cannot believe this.</font>

<font color="yellow">the truth about the artists' survival.</font>

<font color="yellow">a question and answer session with Ms. Ra,</font>

<font color="yellow">announcements from the authorities regarding this accident.</font>

178
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:32,899
<font color="yellow">A deserted island.</font>

179
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,529
<font color="yellow">A part of her memory came back.</font>

180
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,859
<font color="yellow">They were in a deserted island somewhere.</font>

181
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:41,999
<font color="yellow">- Here is the next news. - Are you sure?</font>

182
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,729
<font color="yellow">Yes. She says she's sure.</font>

183
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,899
<font color="yellow">Bring Bong Hee to the headquarter immediately.</font>

184
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:48,829
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

185
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,029
<font color="yellow">Why are you refusing to do it?</font>

186
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:02,899
<font color="yellow">Tae Young. We got an order...</font>

187
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,299
<font color="yellow">to investigate on this case directly from the executives.</font>

188
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:08,329
<font color="yellow">If we handle it well, you and I will...</font>

189
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,599
<font color="yellow">I have something else to do. I'm sorry.</font>

190
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,659
<font color="yellow">Is it because of your sister?</font>

191
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:17,299
<font color="yellow">If a wrong rumor spreads...</font>

192
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:20,429
<font color="yellow">I won't cause any trouble. I'm working with Prosecutor Cho.</font>

193
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,699
<font color="yellow">Do you think she is still alive?</font>

194
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:28,799
<font color="yellow">- I hope so. - What if she's dead?</font>

195
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,599
<font color="yellow">You're throwing away a chance for you to get ahead...</font>

196
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:35,629
<font color="yellow">to investigate it. What are you going to do if she's dead?</font>

197
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:38,299
<font color="yellow">I'll just have to do...</font>

198
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:42,729
<font color="yellow">what I'm supposed to do whether she is alive or dead.</font>

199
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,459
<font color="yellow">What is the thing you're supposed to do?</font>

200
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:47,259
<font color="yellow">The truth.</font>

201
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,899
<font color="yellow">I will find out the truth.</font>

202
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:53,459
<font color="yellow">It is my job to make sure that law is never used wrongfully.</font>

203
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:54,959
<font color="yellow">It's also your duty.</font>

204
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:56,999
<font color="yellow">As in this case,</font>

205
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,559
<font color="yellow">manipulating the truth isn't our job.</font>

206
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,999
<font color="yellow">So you're saying the plane crashed like that,</font>

207
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,429
<font color="yellow">and only two people survived.</font>

208
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,829
<font color="yellow">I mean, Seo Joon Oh...</font>

209
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,729
<font color="yellow">and you.</font>

210
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,799
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

211
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:29,699
<font color="yellow">Don't believe everything she says. We need accurate information.</font>

212
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:30,959
<font color="yellow">Grill her more.</font>

213
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:32,829
<font color="yellow">Ask her for details.</font>

214
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,099
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure how this question will sound,</font>

215
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:41,329
<font color="yellow">but how did you feel...</font>

216
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,629
<font color="yellow">when you realized that you were on a deserted island?</font>

217
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:49,199
<font color="yellow">You don't believe me, do you?</font>

218
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:52,899
<font color="yellow">I couldn't remember anything...</font>

219
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:55,999
<font color="yellow">about the last four months.</font>

220
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:59,259
<font color="yellow">It must look strange that my memory came back partially all of a sudden.</font>

221
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,329
<font color="yellow">It's already strange enough that I survived the plane crash.</font>

222
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,359
<font color="yellow">You probably want to know whether I'm lying or not.</font>

223
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,799
<font color="yellow">I know you're trying to sound me out.</font>

224
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,229
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm just...</font>

225
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,629
<font color="yellow">I don't really remember...</font>

226
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:24,399
<font color="yellow">what happened to everyone.</font>

227
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:26,959
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

228
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,329
<font color="yellow">if I tell you everything I saw and felt...</font>

229
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,829
<font color="yellow">to the best of my recollection,</font>

230
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:39,929
<font color="yellow">will you believe me?</font>

231
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:52,929
<font color="yellow">Will you believe what I tell you?</font>

232
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,759
<font color="yellow">I don't know whether they're still alive or not.</font>

233
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:01,829
<font color="yellow">I don't remember how many are alive or dead,</font>

234
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,829
<font color="yellow">but will you go there to rescue them?</font>

235
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,199
<font color="yellow">Then... Then I will...</font>

236
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:14,529
<font color="yellow">do anything you want me to do...</font>

237
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,399
<font color="yellow">to recover my lost memories.</font>

238
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,199
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

239
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:24,699
<font color="yellow">So please...</font>

240
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,129
<font color="yellow">Don't leave them abandoned there.</font>

241
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:35,999
<font color="yellow">We won't be going home today.</font>

242
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:40,799
<font color="yellow">Say yes.</font>

243
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:44,159
<font color="yellow">One day,</font>

244
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,029
<font color="yellow">I was wondering why something like that happened to me.</font>

245
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,799
<font color="yellow">Out of so many people,</font>

246
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,229
<font color="yellow">why did it have to be me?</font>

247
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:05,129
<font color="yellow">I resented my reality.</font>

248
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:12,299
<font color="yellow">It's medicine for meningitis.</font>

249
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:13,959
<font color="yellow">I thought it may help you recover your memory.</font>

250
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,329
<font color="yellow">One day,</font>

251
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,299
<font color="yellow">the fact...</font>

252
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,799
<font color="yellow">that people died...</font>

253
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,359
<font color="yellow">tortured me.</font>

254
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,459
<font color="yellow">One day,</font>

255
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,329
<font color="yellow">I felt grateful to be alive.</font>

256
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,499
<font color="yellow">Then on another day,</font>

257
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:14,029
<font color="yellow">the desire for survival made me...</font>

258
00:26:15,729 --> 00:26:16,859
<font color="yellow">feel all desperate.</font>

259
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,999
<font color="yellow">Hey, there's a ship. I see a ship over there!</font>

260
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,429
<font color="yellow">There's a ship! Here!</font>

261
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:26,759
<font color="yellow">We're here! Gosh.</font>

262
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:30,799
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey!</font>

263
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,829
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

264
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,199
<font color="yellow">Here!</font>

265
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,559
<font color="yellow">Here!</font>

266
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:41,059
<font color="yellow">You're doing so great! Keep going!</font>

267
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:42,829
<font color="yellow">- Here! - Can you swim all the way there?</font>

268
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:45,359
<font color="yellow">- Help! - That's it. Go! Keep going!</font>

269
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:48,659
<font color="yellow">Even in just one day,</font>

270
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,559
<font color="yellow">hundreds of different feelings...</font>

271
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,429
<font color="yellow">and emotions went through me.</font>

272
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,329
<font color="yellow">I was hurt physically...</font>

273
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,159
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what should I do?</font>

274
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:02,859
<font color="yellow">And my heart was wounded as well.</font>

275
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,699
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?</font>

276
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,599
<font color="yellow">- Let me see. - I can't get this to work.</font>

277
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,329
<font color="yellow">Like a person who received a death sentence,</font>

278
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,799
<font color="yellow">I was taking a day at a time in a state of inertia.</font>

279
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,629
<font color="yellow">Then I saw it.</font>

280
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:30,999
<font color="yellow">What did you see?</font>

281
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,599
<font color="yellow">Hope.</font>

282
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:45,029
<font color="yellow">10, 15.</font>

283
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:47,129
<font color="yellow">10, 25.</font>

284
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:52,159
<font color="yellow">- Did you see anyone around here? - No.</font>

285
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,829
<font color="yellow">He must've gotten rescued.</font>

286
00:27:54,729 --> 00:27:55,899
<font color="yellow">After 25 days.</font>

287
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:58,499
<font color="yellow">- We can live, too! - Yes, we can live!</font>

288
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,329
<font color="yellow">- We can live! - We can live!</font>

289
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:01,599
<font color="yellow">We can live!</font>

290
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:04,859
<font color="yellow">We can live. We can live.</font>

291
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,329
<font color="yellow">We can live!</font>

292
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,659
<font color="yellow">- We can go home! - We can go home!</font>

293
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:15,429
<font color="yellow">Home! Home! No matter what happens,</font>

294
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,299
<font color="yellow">I will go home!</font>

295
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,859
<font color="yellow">- Home! Home! - We can live!</font>

296
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,559
<font color="yellow">After seeing a ray of hope right in front of my eyes,</font>

297
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,359
<font color="yellow">this thought crossed my mind.</font>

298
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:35,429
<font color="yellow">"I must survive."</font>

299
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,029
<font color="yellow">"If I survive,"</font>

300
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,729
<font color="yellow">"someone will come to my rescue."</font>

301
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,199
<font color="yellow">Have you thought about looking for other possible survivors?</font>

302
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,029
<font color="yellow">We did try to look for them, but...</font>

303
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,329
<font color="yellow">Why did you come out already?</font>

304
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:06,699
<font color="yellow">I think we've done enough for today.</font>

305
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:08,559
<font color="yellow">Are you going to say the grass is hurting your skin again?</font>

306
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,699
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. I can't look for anyone on an empty stomach.</font>

307
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:11,899
<font color="yellow">We ate bread in the morning.</font>

308
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:13,929
<font color="yellow">Hey, we should live first.</font>

309
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:16,229
<font color="yellow">No. Let's search for a bit more.</font>

310
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,899
<font color="yellow">Ask her how she sustained herself for four months.</font>

311
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:22,699
<font color="yellow">I'll be specific.</font>

312
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:25,659
<font color="yellow">How did you survive?</font>

313
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,499
<font color="yellow">There are no people,</font>

314
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:34,699
<font color="yellow">which means there are no houses, either.</font>

315
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,899
<font color="yellow">It also means that there's not a single light.</font>

316
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,429
<font color="yellow">If you have to stay in a place like that for over four months,</font>

317
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,099
<font color="yellow">how do you think you'll live?</font>

318
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:55,929
<font color="yellow">You can tie it?</font>

319
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,599
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

320
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,059
<font color="yellow">Gosh, get your jacket out of the way.</font>

321
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:05,799
<font color="yellow">No, not that one. Tie it on the bigger tree.</font>

322
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,559
<font color="yellow">- This one? - Use your fingers.</font>

323
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:08,699
<font color="yellow">It hurts my skin.</font>

324
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:10,529
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. Leave it.</font>

325
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:12,329
<font color="yellow">You should've just done it yourself from the get-go.</font>

326
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:13,999
<font color="yellow">On three! Good. That's it.</font>

327
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,599
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

328
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:17,629
<font color="yellow">- In 1, 2, 3. - 3.</font>

329
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,329
<font color="yellow">- Push it harder. - I'm pushing it. Three!</font>

330
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:22,099
<font color="yellow">- On 3! - 4!</font>

331
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:25,259
<font color="yellow">Should I...</font>

332
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,199
<font color="yellow">Let's do it again.</font>

333
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,129
<font color="yellow">- Pull it again for me. - A little more. To that side.</font>

334
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,629
<font color="yellow">To the right or left? I can't see.</font>

335
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:35,059
<font color="yellow">Lift it more. When will you work on this side?</font>

336
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,599
<font color="yellow">Plants contain water in them.</font>

337
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:42,059
<font color="yellow">If we hit the right spot, we can get water to drip from them.</font>

338
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:45,559
<font color="yellow">It's coming out. See?</font>

339
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:47,529
<font color="yellow">It's working. I told you.</font>

340
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:48,999
<font color="yellow">You were right.</font>

341
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:50,929
<font color="yellow">We'll be able to drink it next year.</font>

342
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,759
<font color="yellow">Hey, we've already been here for a few days.</font>

343
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,799
<font color="yellow">We probably won't have to stay here for 25 days.</font>

344
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,099
<font color="yellow">I can't do this.</font>

345
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:02,729
<font color="yellow">I'm only going to drink this for the rest of our time here.</font>

346
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,499
<font color="yellow">You can have the other two. We're good then, right?</font>

347
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:07,059
<font color="yellow">The same goes for food. I don't eat that much.</font>

348
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,559
<font color="yellow">I'll take this and...</font>

349
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:10,859
<font color="yellow">There's too many of this, so I'll take this one, too.</font>

350
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:11,899
<font color="yellow">Okay? Done.</font>

351
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:12,959
<font color="yellow">Put them down.</font>

352
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,499
<font color="yellow">How shall I divide it up?</font>

353
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:29,599
<font color="yellow">The statements she gave in the last few days have been consistent.</font>

354
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:30,899
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

355
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,759
<font color="yellow">Call China.</font>

356
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:40,299
<font color="yellow">There are 143 small islands around Huizhou, China...</font>

357
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:43,699
<font color="yellow">where Ms. Ra Bong Hee was found.</font>

358
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:45,929
<font color="yellow">It is estimated that 97 of those 143 islands...</font>

359
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,929
<font color="yellow">are uninhabited.</font>

360
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,999
<font color="yellow">If they find any trace of human habitation or dead bodies,</font>

361
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:54,259
<font color="yellow">we requested them to contact us immediately.</font>

362
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,829
<font color="yellow">How long will it take?</font>

363
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:59,229
<font color="yellow">Based on the investigation... I'm not sure, but if I...</font>

364
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:02,699
<font color="yellow">How long will it take to search 97 islands?</font>

365
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:04,459
<font color="yellow">We asked the experts...</font>

366
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:07,199
<font color="yellow">to investigate as soon as possible...</font>

367
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,729
<font color="yellow">Don't simply say you'll do your best...</font>

368
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:11,099
<font color="yellow">as soon as possible.</font>

369
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:14,429
<font color="yellow">Just give me the facts.</font>

370
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,129
<font color="yellow">Actually, I...</font>

371
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:21,129
<font color="yellow">Locating 97 islands and completing the search...</font>

372
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:23,599
<font color="yellow">after receiving enough funds...</font>

373
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:27,599
<font color="yellow">are expected to take at least three months.</font>

374
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:33,959
<font color="yellow">I'll get fired in the meantime.</font>

375
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,699
<font color="yellow">Where is Ra Bong Hee?</font>

376
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,759
<font color="yellow">She's at her mother's house.</font>

377
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,529
<font color="yellow">- Does she have bodyguards? - Yes.</font>

378
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,799
<font color="yellow">Tell them to make sure that no reporters approach her.</font>

379
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,859
<font color="yellow">If the public finds out about her memory loss, we'll be in trouble.</font>

380
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:51,829
<font color="yellow">I'll tell them.</font>

381
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:54,699
<font color="yellow">Stay in charge of the task that has to be done in the headquarter.</font>

382
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,529
<font color="yellow">Keep recording the video and send it to me.</font>

383
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,099
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

384
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:07,999
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yoon, they found her.</font>

385
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:14,499
<font color="yellow">Your sister was found in Huizhou, China.</font>

386
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,859
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

387
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:28,429
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

388
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,059
<font color="yellow">I'm very sorry, Sir.</font>

389
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,199
<font color="yellow">Where in China?</font>

390
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:51,459
<font color="yellow">I'll come back with a lot of seafood.</font>

391
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,169
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

392
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,929
<font color="yellow">- Can't you tell? - It's not necessary.</font>

393
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,459
<font color="yellow">If anyone passes by, they'll see it.</font>

394
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:18,329
<font color="yellow">Here's your lunch.</font>

395
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:23,859
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

396
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,129
<font color="yellow">- Give me some more. - I can't.</font>

397
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:29,929
<font color="yellow">I'm working.</font>

398
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:33,599
<font color="yellow">- Give me some more. - What you're doing is unnecessary.</font>

399
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,299
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't eat it.</font>

400
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:17,799
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Sir.</font>

401
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,229
<font color="yellow">- Your barbecue is ready. - What?</font>

402
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:32,899
<font color="yellow">Would you like some wine, Sir?</font>

403
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:44,359
<font color="yellow">It's rice and pineapple.</font>

404
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:46,799
<font color="yellow">It's pizza.</font>

405
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:49,559
<font color="yellow">Would you like some barbecue, Sir?</font>

406
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,229
<font color="yellow">- I don't really like pork. - Okay.</font>

407
00:35:57,259 --> 00:35:58,299
<font color="yellow">Here's jjamppong, Sir.</font>

408
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,829
<font color="yellow">It's spicy jjamppong.</font>

409
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,829
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

410
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:07,759
<font color="yellow">- Byeong Joo? - Do you like shrimp?</font>

411
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:09,499
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

412
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:12,529
<font color="yellow">Is this what you do for a living?</font>

413
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:15,429
<font color="yellow">Thank you. It's sausage.</font>

414
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:17,999
<font color="yellow">Is it delicious?</font>

415
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:20,459
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

416
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,959
<font color="yellow">Why are you eating these now?</font>

417
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:27,099
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

418
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:28,729
<font color="yellow">Why are you eating these now?</font>

419
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,029
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to.</font>

420
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,859
<font color="yellow">Gosh, have you lost your mind?</font>

421
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:47,099
<font color="yellow">- Why did you eat them now? - I didn't.</font>

422
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,059
<font color="yellow">I was only eating in my dreams.</font>

423
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,629
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

424
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,229
<font color="yellow">I burped out air.</font>

425
00:36:55,229 --> 00:36:56,859
<font color="yellow">I burped out air because I'm hungry.</font>

426
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:58,959
<font color="yellow">I'm doing everything to survive.</font>

427
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:02,259
<font color="yellow">I was saving these. How could you finish everything?</font>

428
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:05,229
<font color="yellow">I said I was eating in my dreams. Why would I eat all of it?</font>

429
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:06,329
<font color="yellow">You've lost your mind.</font>

430
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:08,859
<font color="yellow">You're crazy for eating everything only to save yourself.</font>

431
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:09,929
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

432
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,259
<font color="yellow">Darn it. Listen.</font>

433
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:17,229
<font color="yellow">Is that how you'll talk to me? Did you just call me crazy?</font>

434
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:19,959
<font color="yellow">You're my stylist, and I'm your boss.</font>

435
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:22,729
<font color="yellow">How dare you call your boss crazy?</font>

436
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:23,759
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get fired?</font>

437
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:29,699
<font color="yellow">If we get rescued like that man,</font>

438
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:32,599
<font color="yellow">I'll send you a box of these to your house.</font>

439
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,359
<font color="yellow">Be careful with your words.</font>

440
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,499
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'll fire you. Understand?</font>

441
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:39,229
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

442
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,699
<font color="yellow">- Now that this happened... - Goodness.</font>

443
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,169
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm sorry.</font>

444
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:47,759
<font color="yellow">I wasn't burping. I was just apologizing.</font>

445
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,559
<font color="yellow">What should we do? I ate everything.</font>

446
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,629
<font color="yellow">I ate all of these.</font>

447
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:56,129
<font color="yellow">I finished everything that we had. What will you do?</font>

448
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:57,169
<font color="yellow">What else can we do?</font>

449
00:37:58,529 --> 00:37:59,529
<font color="yellow">We'll catch food.</font>

450
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:05,599
<font color="yellow">Where did you come from?</font>

451
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:09,959
<font color="yellow">Start a fire while I get some food.</font>

452
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:12,299
<font color="yellow">I can't start a fire without a lighter.</font>

453
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:14,669
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm asking you. I wouldn't if we had a lighter.</font>

454
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:16,169
<font color="yellow">Start a fire, okay?</font>

455
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:18,629
<font color="yellow">How can I start a fire?</font>

456
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:20,359
<font color="yellow">What will you catch?</font>

457
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:23,859
<font color="yellow">This is impossible.</font>

458
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:29,759
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how can I start it?</font>

459
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:50,129
<font color="yellow">I knew it was impossible.</font>

460
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,429
<font color="yellow">- Where did you get it? - I found it.</font>

461
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:00,859
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

462
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:03,459
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to start a fire with the lens.</font>

463
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:06,529
<font color="yellow">That's just a piece of glass. It wouldn't start a fire.</font>

464
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:09,059
<font color="yellow">You need a convex lens. That won't work.</font>

465
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:11,959
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me only now? I've been trying for hours.</font>

466
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,799
<font color="yellow">I just saw you do it. Start a fire somehow.</font>

467
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:16,829
<font color="yellow">I'll come back with fish. Here are your presents.</font>

468
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,729
<font color="yellow">- I can't start a fire. - Here you go.</font>

469
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,169
<font color="yellow">I caught three.</font>

470
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:43,029
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness! That startled me.</font>

471
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:44,259
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

472
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,029
<font color="yellow">I almost caught fire.</font>

473
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:03,959
<font color="yellow">I already set up everything.</font>

474
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:10,699
<font color="yellow">What did you do in the past? You can do anything.</font>

475
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:13,899
<font color="yellow">It's not that I can do anything,</font>

476
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:15,799
<font color="yellow">it's you who can't do anything.</font>

477
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:19,029
<font color="yellow">Can you call me by my name?</font>

478
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:20,699
<font color="yellow">I have a name. It's Ra Bong Hee.</font>

479
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:22,529
<font color="yellow">Okay, Ra Bong Hee.</font>

480
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:23,859
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

481
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:31,099
<font color="yellow">You seem to adapt well on deserted islands.</font>

482
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,129
<font color="yellow">It's a perfect place for you to live.</font>

483
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:35,169
<font color="yellow">I can't starve myself without trying.</font>

484
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:37,829
<font color="yellow">I survived until now, so I'll stay alive until we're rescued.</font>

485
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:40,629
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious. Here you go.</font>

486
00:40:40,629 --> 00:40:43,199
<font color="yellow">- What? - Try it. It's ready to eat.</font>

487
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,859
<font color="yellow">- Just like that? - Yes.</font>

488
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,999
<font color="yellow">- I can't debone fish. - What?</font>

489
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:49,359
<font color="yellow">I've had fish bone stuck in my throat when I was young,</font>

490
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,399
<font color="yellow">so I can't debone fish.</font>

491
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:53,799
<font color="yellow">Debone it for me.</font>

492
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:56,669
<font color="yellow">Is there anything you can do?</font>

493
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:59,799
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten already?</font>

494
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:02,559
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you want to get fired...</font>

495
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:08,099
<font color="yellow">How many times do I have to repeat myself?</font>

496
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,299
<font color="yellow">I'm starving.</font>

497
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,559
<font color="yellow">You keep making me feel terrible and cheap.</font>

498
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:15,599
<font color="yellow">It hurts me to say this, but you make me repeat...</font>

499
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,929
<font color="yellow">that I have to fire you.</font>

500
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,529
<font color="yellow">I'm tired of it.</font>

501
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,599
<font color="yellow">Okay, I understand.</font>

502
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:29,629
<font color="yellow">While you debone the fish,</font>

503
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:32,329
<font color="yellow">you should eat some, too.</font>

504
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:35,629
<font color="yellow">It's delicious to eat food while you cook.</font>

505
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:37,399
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

506
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:40,759
<font color="yellow">You take a bite, and I take a bite.</font>

507
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,599
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it delicious? - It's amazing.</font>

508
00:41:49,629 --> 00:41:52,699
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. We should've eaten things like this from the first day.</font>

509
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:53,929
<font color="yellow">Those chips are useless.</font>

510
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:55,729
<font color="yellow">- There's some here. - Eat this.</font>

511
00:41:56,729 --> 00:41:57,799
<font color="yellow">Drop the bone here.</font>

512
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:00,329
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

513
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:02,899
<font color="yellow">I should grill all of it.</font>

514
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:36,629
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey. Joon Oh.</font>

515
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:39,669
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - Come outside. Hurry up.</font>

516
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,729
<font color="yellow">- Come on. - Why? What's going on?</font>

517
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:45,029
<font color="yellow">What is it? Did you find something?</font>

518
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,699
<font color="yellow">- That sound. - Where?</font>

519
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:48,729
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

520
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,359
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - Be quiet.</font>

521
00:43:01,669 --> 00:43:03,859
<font color="yellow">- You saw that, right? - I saw nothing. Let's go back in.</font>

522
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:05,259
<font color="yellow">No, you can't.</font>

523
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:07,559
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

524
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:12,129
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

525
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,029
<font color="yellow">Joon Oh, do you see that?</font>

526
00:43:15,169 --> 00:43:17,169
<font color="yellow">Joon Oh, look at that. Joon Oh...</font>

527
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:20,529
<font color="yellow">- Joon Oh, get back here. - I'm far-sighted,</font>

528
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:21,759
<font color="yellow">so I have to see from afar. Hold on.</font>

529
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:24,259
<font color="yellow">- Gosh... - Don't do that.</font>

530
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:28,459
<font color="yellow">We'll go in there on the count of three, okay?</font>

531
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:51,429
<font color="yellow">Yeol.</font>

532
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:53,499
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey, Yeol.</font>

533
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:56,859
<font color="yellow">Yeol.</font>

534
00:43:58,159 --> 00:43:59,199
<font color="yellow">Yeol!</font>

535
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:13,499
<font color="yellow">There. Tie it now.</font>

536
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:15,659
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

537
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:18,199
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2.</font>

538
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:25,459
<font color="yellow">Hey, you should drink some water.</font>

539
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:32,929
<font color="yellow">Have one more sip.</font>

540
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:34,459
<font color="yellow">Take a big sip.</font>

541
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:15,999
<font color="yellow">Are you up?</font>

542
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:19,559
<font color="yellow">How's your arm?</font>

543
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,859
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, it feels much better.</font>

544
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:24,599
<font color="yellow">I'm glad. Have a seat.</font>

545
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:25,999
<font color="yellow">I was making some porridge.</font>

546
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:29,599
<font color="yellow">The only things we can get here are fish and clams.</font>

547
00:45:30,129 --> 00:45:31,129
<font color="yellow">It's almost ready.</font>

548
00:45:33,259 --> 00:45:35,329
<font color="yellow">It's done. Use this as a spoon...</font>

549
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:39,459
<font color="yellow">You can just drink it with this hand.</font>

550
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:41,159
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

551
00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:43,959
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

552
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:46,799
<font color="yellow">there's something I want to ask you.</font>

553
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,299
<font color="yellow">How did you not die?</font>

554
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:51,899
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

555
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,629
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - It's okay.</font>

556
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:55,459
<font color="yellow">Sorry. That probably sounded weird.</font>

557
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:57,659
<font color="yellow">That's not really what I meant.</font>

558
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:00,259
<font color="yellow">I just want to know how you managed to survive...</font>

559
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:02,629
<font color="yellow">and how you knew that we were here.</font>

560
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:04,499
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to ask you.</font>

561
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,459
<font color="yellow">After the plane crashed,</font>

562
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,259
<font color="yellow">I woke up and...</font>

563
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:31,929
<font color="yellow">I thought I was the only survivor.</font>

564
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,299
<font color="yellow">I waited for a few days...</font>

565
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,899
<font color="yellow">thinking that a rescue team would arrive soon.</font>

566
00:46:45,029 --> 00:46:46,199
<font color="yellow">Then I saw a light.</font>

567
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:48,359
<font color="yellow">That was last night.</font>

568
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:49,599
<font color="yellow">Oh, that light.</font>

569
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:51,659
<font color="yellow">We grilled fish...</font>

570
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:53,759
<font color="yellow">and ate it here.</font>

571
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:57,459
<font color="yellow">Do you think people will come...</font>

572
00:46:58,829 --> 00:46:59,829
<font color="yellow">to rescue me?</font>

573
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:03,159
<font color="yellow">We found a trace of someone with the name "Alden" over there.</font>

574
00:47:03,399 --> 00:47:05,929
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what his nationality is,</font>

575
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:08,429
<font color="yellow">but it looks like he was here long before we ended up here.</font>

576
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,159
<font color="yellow">It seems like he got rescued after living on this island for 25 days.</font>

577
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:13,259
<font color="yellow">That's what I think.</font>

578
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:20,729
<font color="yellow">Bong Hee.</font>

579
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:26,029
<font color="yellow">Have you ever thought about the possibility that we might...</font>

580
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:27,729
<font color="yellow">die here?</font>

581
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:36,929
<font color="yellow">There's a big chance...</font>

582
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,999
<font color="yellow">that no rescue team will come...</font>

583
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,599
<font color="yellow">as it stands now.</font>

584
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:45,429
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why are you so pessimistic?</font>

585
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,499
<font color="yellow">I saw him.</font>

586
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:51,659
<font color="yellow">That Alden guy.</font>

587
00:48:22,259 --> 00:48:23,299
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

588
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:27,959
<font color="yellow">serious?</font>

589
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:31,199
<font color="yellow">If people were able to find this island...</font>

590
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,929
<font color="yellow">and came here even just once,</font>

591
00:48:33,259 --> 00:48:34,629
<font color="yellow">they would've taken...</font>

592
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:37,859
<font color="yellow">those bodies I saw as well.</font>

593
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,399
<font color="yellow">Those corpses.</font>

594
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:54,629
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

595
00:48:55,529 --> 00:48:56,529
<font color="yellow">Hey, you woke up.</font>

596
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:57,559
<font color="yellow">- Joon Oh. - Yes.</font>

597
00:48:58,429 --> 00:49:01,229
<font color="yellow">You two are so chatty. I couldn't even sleep.</font>

598
00:49:01,629 --> 00:49:02,959
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten anything yet?</font>

599
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:06,059
<font color="yellow">Hey, that's not going to be enough.</font>

600
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,899
<font color="yellow">You have to eat some fish.</font>

601
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,299
<font color="yellow">We caught many fish.</font>

602
00:49:11,229 --> 00:49:14,299
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's grill a few of the leftover fish from yesterday.</font>

603
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:18,329
<font color="yellow">Is there none left?</font>

604
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:20,299
<font color="yellow">Right, we ate everything yesterday.</font>

605
00:49:20,729 --> 00:49:23,199
<font color="yellow">Go catch a few more fish, then.</font>

606
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:27,559
<font color="yellow">Goodness, look at you.</font>

607
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:29,759
<font color="yellow">You're tattering my heart to pieces again.</font>

608
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:31,459
<font color="yellow">Hey, if you're going to keep this up,</font>

609
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:34,229
<font color="yellow">I'll fire you when we go back to Seoul.</font>

610
00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:38,729
<font color="yellow">Fine, fire me.</font>

611
00:49:41,029 --> 00:49:42,259
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and fire me, you jerk.</font>

612
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:46,559
<font color="yellow">Fire me.</font>

613
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:49,459
<font color="yellow">Fire me all you want if you're lucky enough to get out of here.</font>

614
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:51,459
<font color="yellow">But you know what?</font>

615
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:53,729
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to leave here.</font>

616
00:49:54,499 --> 00:49:56,799
<font color="yellow">Neither of us will be able to get off this island. Do you understand?</font>

617
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,899
<font color="yellow">- Hey, why... What's... - You jerk.</font>

618
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:02,859
<font color="yellow">- Are you out of your mind? - Seriously!</font>

619
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:03,999
<font color="yellow">- Stop, guys. - Let go.</font>

620
00:50:03,999 --> 00:50:06,299
<font color="yellow">You psycho. Make your own food...</font>

621
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:08,599
<font color="yellow">and catch your own fish, you jerk.</font>

622
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:10,729
<font color="yellow">- I won't eat anything. - You're unbelievable!</font>

623
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:13,599
<font color="yellow">Joon Oh, Joon Oh!</font>

624
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,229
<font color="yellow">Joon Oh, Joon Oh. Get up.</font>

625
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:17,559
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

626
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,099
<font color="yellow">Light.</font>

627
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:47,899
<font color="yellow">People.</font>

628
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,559
<font color="yellow">It must be people.</font>

629
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:52,359
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait! Do you even know where you're going? Gosh.</font>

630
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,959
<font color="yellow">It's probably not people who came to rescue us.</font>

631
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:59,259
<font color="yellow">Joon Oh, they could be like us. Survivors.</font>

632
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:01,329
<font color="yellow">It means they can be people we know.</font>

633
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:03,559
<font color="yellow">- I'll be back, okay? - Yeol, Yeol.</font>

634
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:05,829
<font color="yellow">Hey, you don't even know where it is. You're injured. Yeol!</font>

635
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:20,529
<font color="yellow">Yeol!</font>

636
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:31,599
<font color="yellow">It's gone.</font>

637
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:34,459
<font color="yellow">- Let's go closer to it. - Okay.</font>

638
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:43,459
<font color="yellow">I think it was around here.</font>

639
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:45,199
<font color="yellow">Let's split up.</font>

640
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:47,299
<font color="yellow">Scream if you find anyone or if anything happens.</font>

641
00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:48,899
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

642
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,129
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

643
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:58,229
<font color="yellow">Can anyone hear me?</font>

644
00:52:22,029 --> 00:52:23,059
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

645
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:25,329
<font color="yellow">Help!</font>

646
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,559
<font color="yellow">Bong Hee!</font>

647
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,499
<font color="yellow">Help me!</font>

648
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:42,859
<font color="yellow">I'm stuck in here!</font>

649
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:00,299
<font color="yellow">You should've been careful.</font>

650
00:53:03,399 --> 00:53:04,429
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

651
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:13,829
<font color="yellow">I have one question.</font>

652
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:16,429
<font color="yellow">When you first saw the light,</font>

653
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:21,399
<font color="yellow">why did you keep running without looking back?</font>

654
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:26,959
<font color="yellow">Did you want to help the other survivors if there were any?</font>

655
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:28,829
<font color="yellow">Is that why?</font>

656
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,829
<font color="yellow">I didn't go to help.</font>

657
00:53:40,229 --> 00:53:42,499
<font color="yellow">I actually went there to get help.</font>

658
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:49,659
<font color="yellow">If anyone was on that island,</font>

659
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:54,829
<font color="yellow">I thought their situation would be better than ours.</font>

660
00:53:57,129 --> 00:53:59,199
<font color="yellow">I understand how you must've felt.</font>

661
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:02,859
<font color="yellow">You're right. I would do the same thing, too.</font>

662
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:04,959
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're on a date?</font>

663
00:54:05,399 --> 00:54:07,199
<font color="yellow">Stop talking about unnecessary things...</font>

664
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,329
<font color="yellow">and ask her who the survivor was.</font>

665
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,299
<font color="yellow">Yes. All right.</font>

666
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:14,399
<font color="yellow">Now, Bong Hee.</font>

667
00:54:16,499 --> 00:54:18,059
<font color="yellow">That light from a cellphone.</font>

668
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,759
<font color="yellow">You found a survivor in the face of danger.</font>

669
00:54:22,729 --> 00:54:23,759
<font color="yellow">Who was that person?</font>

670
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,399
<font color="yellow">Do you remember? Do you?</font>

671
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,659
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

672
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:37,229
<font color="yellow">- I just... - You startled me.</font>

673
00:54:37,629 --> 00:54:38,699
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

674
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:46,329
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saving me.</font>

675
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:48,929
<font color="yellow">You'd do the same thing for me.</font>

676
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,559
<font color="yellow">Thank you anyway.</font>

677
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:54,299
<font color="yellow">I won't forget that.</font>

678
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,829
<font color="yellow">That's right. You shouldn't. Remember it forever.</font>

679
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,229
<font color="yellow">- You were so... - Joon Oh!</font>

680
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:02,829
<font color="yellow">- Yeol. - Bong Hee.</font>

681
00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:05,859
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? What happened?</font>

682
00:55:05,859 --> 00:55:08,429
<font color="yellow">- I stumbled. - You didn't get hurt, right?</font>

683
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:09,599
<font color="yellow">I didn't. I'm okay.</font>

684
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,129
<font color="yellow">You two shouldn't have...</font>

685
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:13,129
<font color="yellow">Let's just go. It's cold.</font>

686
00:55:17,029 --> 00:55:18,429
<font color="yellow">You have to remember, Bong Hee.</font>

687
00:55:19,459 --> 00:55:20,499
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

688
00:55:23,129 --> 00:55:24,629
<font color="yellow">Who was that person?</font>

689
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:26,459
<font color="yellow">Did that person die or not afterwards?</font>

690
00:55:27,299 --> 00:55:30,059
<font color="yellow">- That's... - Do you remember that?</font>

691
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:32,699
<font color="yellow">That person was...</font>

692
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:37,499
<font color="yellow">- No! - Where are you going?</font>

693
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:38,499
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

694
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:41,829
<font color="yellow">That person was...</font>

695
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:53,929
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it was...</font>

696
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:07,129
<font color="yellow">I did see that person's face.</font>

697
00:56:16,229 --> 00:56:18,059
<font color="yellow">Did you see it? Who was it?</font>

698
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,659
<font color="yellow">I saw the face, but...</font>

699
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:44,929
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

700
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:10,859
<font color="yellow">Ji Ah!</font>

701
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,429
<font color="yellow">Ji Ah.</font>

702
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:15,829
<font color="yellow">Ji Ah.</font>

703
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:17,759
<font color="yellow">Ji Ah.</font>

704
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:20,529
<font color="yellow">How... How did you...</font>

705
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:24,029
<font color="yellow">Where have you been? Why did you leave me alone?</font>

706
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:26,059
<font color="yellow">Ji Ah. Are you hurt?</font>

707
00:57:27,299 --> 00:57:28,459
<font color="yellow">Stop crying, Ji Ah.</font>

708
00:57:28,459 --> 00:57:30,559
<font color="yellow">How did you manage to survive until now?</font>

709
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:34,929
<font color="yellow">Have you been here by yourself? Have you?</font>

710
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:38,959
<font color="yellow">No. I was with someone.</font>

711
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:14,029
<font color="yellow">They found her near the seashore,</font>

712
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,199
<font color="yellow">but it wasn't the plane crash that killed her.</font>

713
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,129
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

714
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:22,129
<font color="yellow">He says it seems like she was murdered.</font>

715
00:58:27,729 --> 00:58:29,829
<font color="yellow">I've been staying here since the crash.</font>

716
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:31,929
<font color="yellow">Then I met her. She was alone.</font>

717
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,759
<font color="yellow">- Why are you saying she's strange? - Just come. We're almost there.</font>

718
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:37,929
<font color="yellow">She's been anxious. She barely eats.</font>

719
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:39,629
<font color="yellow">Who would be okay in this situation?</font>

720
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:41,629
<font color="yellow">She even tried to kill herself a few days ago.</font>

721
00:58:42,029 --> 00:58:43,059
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

722
00:58:43,399 --> 00:58:45,659
<font color="yellow">She says she wants to die, and it's miserable being here.</font>

723
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:03,559
<font color="yellow">He's asking how he's related to her.</font>

724
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:07,729
<font color="yellow">Tell them she's his sister.</font>

725
01:00:43,229 --> 01:00:44,329
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, So Hee?</font>

726
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:06,029
<font color="yellow">Medically speaking,</font>

727
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,929
<font color="yellow">she's supposed to remember.</font>

728
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:10,759
<font color="yellow">You're saying...</font>

729
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,229
<font color="yellow">it's possible that Bong Hee is pretending not to remember...</font>

730
01:01:14,229 --> 01:01:15,959
<font color="yellow">when she actually remembers.</font>

731
01:01:16,829 --> 01:01:17,829
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

732
01:01:19,129 --> 01:01:20,499
<font color="yellow">That is what I can tell you.</font>

733
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:24,029
<font color="yellow">Medically, it doesn't make sense that she doesn't remember.</font>

734
01:01:54,899 --> 01:01:58,159
<font color="yellow">(Missing 9)</font>

735
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:01,259
<font color="yellow">I think they were quite close on the island.</font>

736
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,259
<font color="yellow">Do you understand the situation?</font>

737
01:02:02,259 --> 01:02:05,329
<font color="yellow">Do you remember who killed my sister?</font>

738
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:07,599
<font color="yellow">People can kill others to save themselves.</font>

739
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,729
<font color="yellow">You can kill again since we're on a deserted island.</font>

740
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:12,729
<font color="yellow">It'll be shocking news if people find out that you're still alive.</font>

741
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:14,699
<font color="yellow">- Are you sick? - It won't kill me.</font>

742
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:15,799
<font color="yellow">You might die.</font>

743
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:18,859
<font color="yellow">We don't know who's alive or dead, but there must be survivors.</font>

744
01:02:18,859 --> 01:02:20,499
<font color="yellow">I doubt everyone else died.</font>

745
01:02:20,729 --> 01:02:23,259
<font color="yellow">- Tae Ho? - You're still alive!</font>

746
01:02:23,259 --> 01:02:24,629
<font color="yellow">Whether we starve or get killed,</font>

747
01:02:24,629 --> 01:02:26,399
<font color="yellow">we'll die here anyway.</font>

748
01:02:26,499 --> 01:02:28,129
<font color="yellow">- So Hee is acting strange. - So Hee!</font>

749
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:31,259
<font color="yellow">One of the missing people was Seo Joon Oh.</font>

750
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:32,999
<font color="yellow">He has an interesting background.</font>
