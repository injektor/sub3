00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,270
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,170
I didn't know you worked for Chairman K.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,770
Remember one thing.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,670
Neither of you are allowed to ask personal questions.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,390
Will you really not tell me who gave the tip?

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,840
He hates being at the centre of attention.

7
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,310
Kang Ga Din!

8
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,340
Sir!

9
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,040
Ga Din, what's wrong?

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,440
Why did you collapse?

11
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,270
My head hurts.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,220
Call Dodo Hospital and ask Dr Kim to come over immediately.

13
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,240
Hurry!

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
Ga Din, are you okay?

15
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,110
What is wrong?

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,770
Kang Gi Tan!

17
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,070
(Lee Soo Tak)

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,610
Excuse me.

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Yes, speak.

20
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,310
Really? Okay.

21
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,840
You'll have to see him next time.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,190
What's wrong?

23
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,360
Something suddenly came up.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,460
What is it?

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,180
I can't tell you the details.

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,870
We'll contact you later.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Hey, Mr Moon.

28
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,340
- Thank you.
 -  Sure.

29
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,840
Has Gi Tan always been this weak?

30
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,270
The doctor said he's just tired. He'll be fine.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
No.

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,770
He's been through so much, going to jail and everything.

33
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,670
He looks all right, but he must be a mess inside.

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
It's nothing like that. Don't worry, and you can leave now.

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,670
No. I'll stay.

36
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,230
Pardon?

37
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,240
I'll be with him until he wakes up.

38
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,040
You can leave.

39
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,610
Chairman may not want you here.

40
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,270
I will look after him. Is there a problem?

41
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,070
This is his private area.

42
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,240
This is my hotel.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,070
You can't do this.

44
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,310
Whatever.

45
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,370
I'm not leaving if he's not.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Do you understand?

47
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,610
I don't think you understand.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,170
(Ok Chae Ryung)

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Hello?

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,570
Ji Soo was attacked.

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,210
Tell me more.

52
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,970
Gi Tan.

53
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,540
Everyone left for the hospital, so I don't know the details.

54
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,670
I can't go there since there will be a lot of reporters.

55
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,770
I guess it'll be on the news tomorrow morning.

56
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,410
It'll cause trouble if they spot you.

57
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,780
Don't go out for a while.

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,900
I won't.

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,440
I'll let you know if I find out anything.

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,610
(Restricted Zone)

61
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,380
How do you feel?

62
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,840
It hurts a bit,

63
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,540
but I can stand it.

64
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,410
You're lucky it's not any worse.

65
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,040
It could have been dangerous.

66
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,610
Are there reporters outside?

67
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,170
Yes.

68
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,540
Doctor.

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,210
Get us a trustworthy doctor...

70
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,340
and book an operating room.

71
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,360
What do you mean?

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,610
Are you telling me to get a surgery?

73
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,140
All you have to do is lie in bed and kill time.

74
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,920
- Honey.
 -  This is an opportunity.

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,140
We can't miss it.

76
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,770
Even if it's sympathy,

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,730
we must win the hearts of the public.

78
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,470
What if they find out that it's all an act?

79
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,310
This is no time to be afraid of that.

80
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,810
It's your chance to regain your honour.

81
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,510
It'll become a big help for my election as well.

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,670
Doctor.

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Will you help us?

84
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,770
Yes, Sir.

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,210
Honey! Wake up!

86
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,280
- Honey!
 -  Ji Soo!

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,670
What happened?

88
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,840
Ji Soo is in a critical condition.

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,910
What?

90
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,440
Honey!

91
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,810
Honey!

92
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,410
My greed...

93
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,410
stabbed me in the back.

94
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,610
I can't believe I hurt my own child.

95
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,930
Keep it down, someone will hear you.

96
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,770
How can this happen?

97
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,910
Ji Soo. Ji Soo!

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,710
- Sir.
 -  Let me go.

99
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,170
You can leave.

100
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,350
How long do I have to wait?

101
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,240
Your husband asked me to take as long as I can.

102
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,240
My head hurts.

103
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,770
Thinking about this whole thing hurts my head more.

104
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,510
You should take a nap.

105
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,240
It'll do you good.

106
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,970
(Operating Room)

107
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,910
How is Congresswoman Hwang doing?

108
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,510
Right now,

109
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,640
it's not looking good.

110
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,770
According to the doctors,

111
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,640
they'll have to see after the surgery.

112
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,240
The assailant the police caught said...

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,840
that he has a grudge against you.

114
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,370
During my campaign,

115
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,670
I got involved in a fist fight because some tenants...

116
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,710
were about to be kicked out...

117
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,070
by the people who were hired by the landlord.

118
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,410
The assailant...

119
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,540
is the same man from that fight.

120
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,140
You must have mixed feelings.

121
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,810
He should have...

122
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,870
attacked me instead.

123
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,570
I feel so sorry.

124
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,370
It's so painful.

125
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,970
Do you regret any of the campaigns you've run?

126
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,740
If a person...

127
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,540
dares to swing a pipe at a mayoral candidate,

128
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,240
I can only imagine what kind of...

129
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,940
harsh treatment our citizens were facing.

130
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,610
Regardless of the election's result,

131
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,440
I won't stop fighting...

132
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
for the weak people...

133
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,540
of our land.

134
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,040
I think you can go home after this coffee.

135
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,670
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,810
- A fake surgery?
 -  Yes.

137
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,340
I heard from that man.

138
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,570
With your bait, Il Jae caught a huge fish.

139
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,840
You two are amazing.

140
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,070
Rude jerk.

141
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,410
Why didn't he tell me?

142
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,310
There were some mix-ups,

143
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,070
but we achieved our goal.

144
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,940
Make sure...

145
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,240
to keep that...

146
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,010
assailant's mouth closed.

147
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,710
Don't worry.

148
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,840
He'll be reading the script I wrote for him...

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,480
at the station right now.

150
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,090
You said Chae Ryung is staying at your house, right?

151
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,910
It's probably best to keep it a secret from her.

152
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,240
You were the one who told me...

153
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,440
that she's being chased by Gi Ryang.

154
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,010
There's no harm...

155
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,310
in being careful.

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
Hey, Ga Din.

157
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,140
You should consider yourself lucky.

158
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,640
I don't nurse just anyone.

159
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,310
Are you all right?

160
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Yes.

161
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,510
What happened to Shin Young?

162
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,070
She wanted to nurse you and wouldn't budge. I'm sorry.

163
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,470
Let me ask you one thing.

164
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,840
You told me that I used to know Soo Yeon before, right?

165
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,810
- What?
 -  I'm sure...

166
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,940
that you told me I knew her.

167
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,970
I saw you watching the television programme she's on.

168
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,910
So I assumed you knew.

169
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,870
But...

170
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,000
why are you bringing her up?

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,670
I think there must be something...

172
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,710
between her and me.

173
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,810
What do you mean?

174
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,590
I want to meet her. Do you have her number?

175
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,930
- Yes.
 -  Call her and tell her that...

176
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,510
I'd like to see her.

177
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,540
Yes, Sir.

178
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,540
(Lawyer Oh Soo Yeon)

179
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,770
The number you're calling...

180
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,840
She's not picking up.

181
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,540
Do you know where she lives?

182
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,040
Sir. It's too late right now.

183
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,610
Soo Tak must know. Call him and ask.

184
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,010
Cheers.

185
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,010
Bottoms up. I'll kick you if you don't finish it.

186
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,210
We already drank a lot at the bar.

187
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,710
Why are you forcing us to drink?

188
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,310
Hey.

189
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,570
We got the contract...

190
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,800
and helped as the legal advisor.

191
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,970
If we aren't going to drink today, when will we ever drink?

192
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,670
Soo Yeon.

193
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,670
Congratulations. Bottoms up.

194
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,470
I already had a lot to drink.

195
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,710
It's all right.

196
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,510
This is your home. You can sleep right away.

197
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,110
I'll drink it for her.

198
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,320
It's okay. You can't take your alcohol.

199
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,540
- Drink it.
 -  Drink it.

200
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,900
I won't stop dancing if you don't drink that.

201
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,240
Okay, I'll drink it.

202
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,670
My gosh.

203
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,610
Are you okay?

204
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,370
Mr Do.

205
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,080
Yes?

206
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,170
You like Soo Yeon, don't you?

207
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,180
You've been looking out for her.

208
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,410
Mr Min.

209
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,470
Stop it.

210
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,240
Can't I speak what's on my mind?

211
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,970
Yes, I do.

212
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,440
My gosh! We need more alcohol.

213
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,210
Let's go and get some.

214
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,340
What? You can go alone.

215
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,640
My gosh. This is why you're single.

216
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,910
Come on. Hurry.

217
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,530
We'll be back.

218
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,410
Stay here, okay?

219
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,410
Put on your shoes.

220
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,010
Thank you...

221
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,410
for turning down Gwang Woo's proposal.

222
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,350
So what?

223
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,310
Did you tell him what our price is?

224
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,370
I did. Geuk Dong will write down 70 dollars less than what we'll do.

225
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,980
I want to give you a proper reward.

226
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,800
If you'd like, I can find you another place to live.

227
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,570
That's not necessary, Sir.

228
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,040
You can speak casually when we're by ourselves.

229
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,770
Does Il Jae know...

230
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,540
any of your weaknesses?

231
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,110
It looked like...

232
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,410
you were in a trap.

233
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,870
Did you think...

234
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,240
you can just leave?

235
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,810
Not at all.

236
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,710
Our relationship...

237
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,890
will only end when one of us is dead!

238
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,170
Il Jae is someone...

239
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,470
who'd take advantage of another's weakness.

240
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,570
Do you want to work with me?

241
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,410
I'm not trying to use you.

242
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,970
I am saying that I will become your side.

243
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,710
Do you want...

244
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,740
to fight Il Jae together?

245
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,970
You don't have to answer me right now.

246
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,240
You can turn it down if it's too hard.

247
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,770
I've got nothing to fear...

248
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,510
if you're beside me.

249
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,410
I will give you some reports on his company by tomorrow.

250
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,710
I promise.

251
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,470
I will...

252
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,510
never leave you...

253
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,610
before you do.

254
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,870
How far did Mr Min go to get beer?

255
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,240
Does Lawyer Oh...

256
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,840
live in that rooftop house?

257
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,470
Yes.

258
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,810
Where's your assistant?

259
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,610
He'll be here soon. You should go back and get some rest.

260
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,240
It's okay. I'll see you off.

261
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,810
We can do a handshake, right?

262
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,680
We're partners now.

263
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,510
They are dating, aren't they?

264
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,470
Chairman.

265
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Let's go back.

266
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,480
Aren't you going to meet her?

267
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,040
I thought wrong.

268
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,040
I don't need to meet her.

269
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,410
- Let's go.
 -  Yes, Sir.

270
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,370
Soo Yeon, that little witch.

271
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,570
I asked her for help,

272
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,610
and she threw me away like trash.

273
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,610
I am so frustrated,

274
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,970
but I can't hold back my tears like an idiot.

275
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,570
Are you crying?

276
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,640
No one is crying.

277
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,310
I'm just frustrated that I messed it up.

278
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,680
What a fool. How could you trust her?

279
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,740
You were embarrassed again by the girl who sent you off to prison.

280
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,890
Stop bringing it up. You're going to make me cry again.

281
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,180
It's too early to give up.

282
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,000
What are you talking about?

283
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,970
Chairman K pushed back his contract with Gun Woo.

284
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,730
Is that true? Why?

285
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,970
I don't know that far.

286
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,710
There are many instances where contracts get annulled.

287
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,810
Yes, there are. Many companies break up...

288
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,640
even after signing their MOU.

289
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,440
Now, you can run over and settle the contract...

290
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,010
before Gun Woo does. If so, this will become yours.

291
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,910
Gun Woo won't accept it.

292
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't worry.

293
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,180
I'm going to take his position away at our board meeting tomorrow.

294
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,730
I love how you work.

295
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,110
I'm not the chairman for nothing.

296
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,830
I don't do lukewarm business like your father does.

297
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,510
I make sure I get things done.

298
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,810
Okay, Mum.

299
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,970
I will settle this for once.

300
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,040
What in the world is Shin Young up to?

301
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,210
She didn't even tell us that she held the event.

302
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,870
Shin Young is...

303
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,240
just like Dad. She's inconsiderate.

304
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,910
I must've been crazy.

305
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,640
I slept in someone else's bed.

306
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,310
But why didn't Ga Din wake me up?

307
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,570
Congresswoman Hwang Ji Soo's past records are...

308
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,110
receiving attention after her accident.

309
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,570
Not only did she help patients who suffered from T9 coating agent,

310
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,840
but she also helped them work through their lawsuit...

311
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,070
against the company which distributed T9 coating agent.

312
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,230
She is recovering quickly from the wounds...

313
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,170
she got in this attack.

314
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,100
Il Jae and Ji Soo became the people's heroes...

315
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,990
after this attack.

316
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,010
I told you.

317
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,570
Il Jae isn't an easy fight.

318
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,570
Do you believe this attack was staged from their side?

319
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,240
It could be.

320
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,240
I will look into that.

321
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Good morning.

322
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,340
Are you okay?

323
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,940
I slept on the couch because of you.

324
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,540
What were you thinking?

325
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,010
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,910
I'll take off a day's fee from your bill. Happy?

327
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,870
You need to settle the contract.

328
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,010
Call Dodo Group and tell them to be here by 4pm.

329
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,040
Yes, Sir.

330
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,410
Excuse me,

331
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,210
can you seal that deal with me?

332
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,180
Why don't you seal the contract with me?

333
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,600
This isn't some kind of a joke.

334
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,460
Everything has its formality.

335
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm also on Dodo Group's board, and I'm Chairman's daughter.

336
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,840
There is nothing wrong with my signing off the contract.

337
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,640
Why are you stepping in?

338
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,070
Gwang Woo and Gun Woo are...

339
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,540
fighting each other to become the successor.

340
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,710
I want to take part.

341
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,740
Then come to the meeting room by 4pm.

342
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,340
Sir.

343
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,240
Will you let me do it?

344
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,310
I'll think about it.

345
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,510
There's nothing to consider.

346
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,010
You don't like Gwang Woo, and you hate Gun Woo.

347
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,830
- I don't like you either.
 -  Gi Tan.

348
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,240
I'll give it a thought.

349
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
See you in the afternoon.

350
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,840
Shin Young.

351
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,970
Yes? Why?

352
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,340
Make sure I don't pay for yesterday.

353
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,240
Are you thinking about giving the contract to her?

354
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,070
It'll be worth watching those three fight.

355
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I want to think about which one of them will...

356
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,440
bring me more advantage.

357
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,280
Okay. We'll be there by 4pm.

358
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,570
Who will be attending?

359
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,840
It'll be me and Lawyer Oh.

360
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,410
We'd rather not have Lawyer Oh here.

361
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,840
You should come here alone.

362
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,070
Is this necessary?

363
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,910
It's best we keep Soo Yeon away from him until...

364
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,640
Professor Jin gets here.

365
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,540
Okay.

366
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,940
I don't mind.

367
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,140
I think we should do what they say until we sign the contract.

368
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,970
He's just like the rumours. What an odd man.

369
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,640
Sir, this is bad. The board let CEO Do take charge...

370
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,540
of the ship's contract during the board meeting.

371
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,610
The board meeting?

372
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,600
Did they hold a meeting without me?

373
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,640
Yes, CEO Do just left for the hotel.

374
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,370
We must go over to Dodo Hotel right now, too.

375
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,910
Yes, Sir.

376
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,170
Where do you think you're going?

377
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,860
If you've been notified, you should quietly sit here.

378
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,930
You became rather straightforward.

379
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,440
I don't have any reason to hide this.

380
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,580
You've been telling everyone about how you'll reinstate your father.

381
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,770
We got this project because of me.

382
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,340
Great job, so now, rest!

383
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,450
Gwang Woo will take care of the rest.

384
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,740
- I won't back down.
 -  It's the board's decision.

385
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,710
If you make any rash moves, you'll take the responsibility.

386
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,670
You can do whatever you want, but I'm not backing down.

387
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,740
It looks like he doesn't even care that I'm his boss.

388
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,370
It's me, Gwang Woo.

389
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,240
Gun Woo just left.

390
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,970
I thought you were going to stop him.

391
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,470
He ran off. What could I do?

392
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,810
Get the contract signed before he gets there.

393
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,440
The meeting is at 4pm. What if Chairman K won't meet me?

394
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,210
In that case, do whatever it takes to stop Gun Woo.

395
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,370
Gun Woo will take the responsibility.

396
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,440
It's a great loss to our company.

397
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,110
That's not what's important.

398
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,240
This is about my control and your becoming the successor.

399
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,740
Get a grip, you idiot!

400
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,240
Open it.

401
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,700
Where is the meeting at?

402
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,370
- It's in the diamond room.
 -  Right.

403
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,640
What brings you here, CEO Do?

404
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,110
Why do you ask? I'm here to seal the contract.

405
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,010
Gun Woo is supposed to come for that.

406
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,610
The person in charge changed to me during our board meeting today.

407
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,210
Why? Don't you trust me? Do you want to see the contract?

408
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,040
I'll tell Chairman. Lead them to the diamond room.

409
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,110
Yes, Sir.

410
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,470
Follow me.

411
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,840
- Gwang Woo is here?
 -  Yes.

412
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,770
It looks like the three siblings are starting their fight...

413
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,640
just as you expected.

414
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,610
Gun Woo will be here soon, too. Whose side will you take?

415
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,540
Oh my goodness.

416
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,960
Hey, Gun Woo.

417
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,140
Why are you here?

418
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,870
You've ruined so many things before. You should learn your place.

419
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,840
What?

420
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,810
What? Ruined things?

421
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,350
You should play fair if you want to play this game.

422
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,840
Stop trying to steal others' food bowls like a stray cat.

423
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,560
Hey, I'm not the stray cat. You are.

424
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,170
Dodo Group was mine to begin with!

425
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,610
If you are the real owner of this group, you can't sell off...

426
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,470
this business to Geukdong Group!

427
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,500
- What?
 -  If you want to keep your place,

428
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,570
you'd better stay quiet. I'm holding myself back.

429
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,670
Hey, do you really want to die?

430
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,350
You can try if you want, but you'll probably die first!

431
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,870
Are you kidding me? Do you really want to die?

432
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,770
What are you doing in my hotel?

433
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,770
Are you dogs? You're always growling at each other.

434
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,570
How embarrassing is this?

435
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,440
Shin Young, you are well-acquainted with Chairman K.

436
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,370
Gun Woo's trying to take over our company,

437
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,410
so you have to help me out.

438
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,970
Chairman K said he'll sign the contract with me.

439
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,170
- What?
 -  You can't barge in like this?

440
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,080
Why can't I step in?

441
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,410
I'm neither a love child nor an ex-convict.

442
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,210
Ex-convict? You little...

443
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,810
Why? Are you going to hit me?

444
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,910
You can try if you want to go back to jail.

445
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,890
Shin Young, come on.

446
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,640
I am your brother. We're blood-related.

447
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,770
That's why you're more embarrassing.

448
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,930
- Shin Young.
 -  Don't speak.

449
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,540
I don't even want to speak with you.

450
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,610
You should make your decision.

451
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,770
Whose side will you take?

452
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,710
Who do you like, Mr Moon?

453
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,470
If we need Do Choong, we should go with Gun Woo.

454
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,010
If we need Hwang Gwi Ja, we'll go with Shin Young or Gwang Woo.

455
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,070
Chairman asked the contractor to come on up.

456
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,810
And who would that be?

457
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,740
Who do you think? It's me.

458
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,970
Gun Woo.

459
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,940
He's looking for you.

460
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,760
CEO Do Gun Woo? Not me?

461
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,310
Look here.

462
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,740
You did tell him that I'm now in charge, right?

463
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,310
Please follow me.

464
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,740
Is Ga Din insane?

465
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,810
Kang Ga Din?

466
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,910
CEO Do Gun Woo is here.

467
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,570
It's been a while, Gun Woo.

468
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,310
I thought you'd be shocked, so I've prepared some drinks.

469
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,110
Have some.

470
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,870
Kang Gi Tan?

471
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,410
Chairman K is Gi Tan?

472
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,340
Yes. Stop asking. I'm so frustrated.

473
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,280
Wait... Wait... Shin Young,

474
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,740
what are you talking about?

475
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,240
Gi Tan is dead.

476
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,110
How can a dead man be alive?

477
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,070
He didn't die. That's why he's alive.

478
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,810
Stop asking obvious questions.

479
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,210
You must be wondering what happened.

480
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,810
Well...

481
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,240
Is that even important right now?

482
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,840
We're here to do business.

483
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,070
Let me ask you one more thing.

484
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,340
Why did you choose me?

485
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,310
You're a little better...

486
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,040
at business compared to Gwang Woo and Shin Young.

487
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,880
I came here to represent the Chinese shipowners.

488
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,470
So my reputation is important.

489
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,770
One shouldn't let personal feelings...

490
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,710
get in the way of business.

491
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,770
Here, sign on this.

492
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,810
As you can see from the contract,

493
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,470
you can consider this...

494
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,670
as a type of an agreement.

495
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,370
We'll try to adjust the details to the agreement,

496
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,040
but keep in mind that we might cancel it last minute...

497
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,740
if our conditions don't agree.

498
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,920
You better keep your word about leaving personal feelings...

499
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,970
out of this.

500
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,940
(Do Gun Woo)

501
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,240
By the way, why didn't your legal counsel tag along?

502
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,040
I thought you two were always side by side.

503
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,870
Did you have a fight?

504
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,810
Are you talking about Soo Yeon?

505
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,240
Never mind. I'm not interested in other people's love lives.

506
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,810
Gi Tan.

507
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,410
- Did you just say...
 -  Sir.

508
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,320
You have dinner plans with some bank presidents.

509
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,510
You should wrap this up.

510
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,170
Go see him out.

511
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,440
I'll see you out, Sir.

512
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,770
Tell me. What's wrong with Gi Tan?

513
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,540
- What about him?
 -  Is he acting that way...

514
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
or does he really not know her?

515
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,210
I don't know if I should tell you or not.

516
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,240
Who is it?

517
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,140
What happened? You didn't pick up my call.

518
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,330
He doesn't remember Soo Yeon?

519
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,340
No.

520
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,240
So I think it'll be best if they are kept away from each other.

521
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
What's wrong?

522
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,670
Did the deal go wrong?

523
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,510
No, we signed it.

524
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,330
I'm glad. I thought that maybe you didn't get it.

525
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,340
Soo Yeon.

526
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,610
You'd say no if I asked to hold you, right?

527
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,340
Gun Woo.

528
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
Never mind.

529
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,510
I'm hungry. Did you eat yet?

530
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,040
Will you wait for me? I'll just dry my hair.

531
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,210
Move.

532
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,710
Hey, Gi Tan!

533
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Gosh.

534
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,420
What do you think you're doing?

535
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,440
You.

536
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,110
Do I look like a joke to you?

537
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,410
You used to hate Gun Woo.

538
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,170
Are you saying Gun Woo is better than me?

539
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,410
The contract is already signed. Don't bother.

540
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,540
That really hurts my pride.

541
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
I'm going...

542
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,210
to seduce that man.

543
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,940
Is that possible?

544
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,670
Do you know how many lives I've ruined to date?

545
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,580
If I put my mind to it,

546
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,430
it's over for him.

547
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,140
By the way, Ma'am.

548
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,970
Have you tried seducing before?

549
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,010
Why would I ever do that?

550
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,110
They're always crawling at my feet.

551
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,720
Those men's lives were ruined because they liked you first.

552
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,670
The problem is that you never...

553
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,240
seduced them first.

554
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,230
I just never tried it before.

555
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,240
It'll be easy to win over a man like him.

556
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,340
In my opinion, it'll be hard to make him budge.

557
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,910
Watch me...

558
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,970
and see how I cook him up.

559
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,310
I'll make him obsess over me...

560
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,110
before I dump him like trash.

561
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,710
Sir?

562
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,670
Should I go for a dip?

563
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,540
I knew it. He won't be able to help himself.

564
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,370
What's wrong with him?

565
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,940
What about now?

566
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,810
Okay, Ga Din.

567
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,910
I got you now.

568
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,840
That's right, I'm Shin Young.

569
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,170
Shin Young, the femme fatale.

570
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,440
Shin Young! Are you all right?

571
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,370
I can't move...

572
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,640
Don't come near me. Go away, Ga Din. Go away!

573
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,610
Where does it hurt?

574
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,430
I told you to go away. Don't look at me.

575
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,580
Let's go to the emergency.

576
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,810
Do you think you can wrap your arms around my neck?

577
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,340
What are you looking at? Is this a show?

578
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Hold me.

579
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Go on.

580
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,710
I'll get up on three.

581
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,340
It might hurt.

582
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,840
How embarrassing.

583
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,910
What if he can hear my heartbeat?

584
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,240
Ma'am! Ma'am!

585
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,470
I think you should give up now.

586
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,640
Shut that mouth!

587
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,440
Are you all right?

588
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Kang Ga Din.

589
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,440
I came to see your boss.

590
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,110
If you're here to thank me, don't mention it.

591
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,840
I'm not here to thank you.

592
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,440
I came to warn you.

593
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,140
You.

594
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,710
You'll fall in love with me in a week.

595
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,080
Are you hoping I'd go crazy in a week?

596
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,540
I'm Do Shin Young.

597
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,370
I can write up a book full of the names of men...

598
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,430
who tried to commit suicide because of me.

599
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,510
I can understand how they felt.

600
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,410
They must have been suffering a lot.

601
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,790
Go out for dinner, watch a movie and have a drink with me.

602
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,930
It'll only take three days.

603
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,670
I don't think that's enough to make me go crazy.

604
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,330
Are you scared you'll fall in love with me?

605
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,580
I'm already scared of you as is. Just leave.

606
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,770
We'll see if you can still act like this...

607
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,410
a week from now on.

608
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,910
Do you hate Shin Young that much?

609
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,480
If you plan on using her to take over Dodo Group,

610
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,910
you should accept her.

611
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,810
I'm going to leave it as business.

612
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,740
Things might go astray if personal feelings are involved.

613
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,740
Gun Woo signed the contract.

614
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,610
Aren't you worried?

615
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,730
Starving won't help anything.

616
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,810
So, what now?

617
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,680
If Dad is reinstated at the general meeting,

618
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,310
it'll be over for us.

619
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,580
There's still time.

620
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,040
Think of something instead of worrying.

621
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,440
I can't think of anything and I really tried.

622
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,640
Don't you have any ideas?

623
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,640
I have many.

624
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,740
The problem is picking the best one.

625
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,540
You do have something up your sleeve then.

626
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,140
Don't worry and eat.

627
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,770
I won't go down that easily.

628
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,210
Okay, Mum.

629
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,470
That's so hot.

630
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,910
It's boiling.

631
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,110
I burned my mouth.

632
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,240
A bit more.

633
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,940
Just a bit more.

634
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,910
That's it. Keep going. One more step.

635
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,810
You can do it. Hang in there.

636
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
Sir.

637
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,740
I told you not to push too hard.

638
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,910
When did you say that?

639
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,640
You just told me to hang in there and take one more step!

640
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,570
I apologise.

641
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:29,640
But you did much better today than you did yesterday.

642
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,210
It's far from good.

643
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,440
At the general meeting,

644
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,640
I will walk in on my own two legs.

645
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:41,640
You will do that. I'm sure of it.

646
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,070
Hang on.

647
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,450
Do I smell patjuk?

648
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,980
Your wife...

649
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,110
made some earlier today.

650
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,910
Did she?

651
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,070
She makes some mean patjuk.

652
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,170
Shall I go and bring some in secret?

653
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,240
Don't.

654
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,570
Not eating patjuk won't kill me.

655
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,460
You need to eat well to get well.

656
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,740
You didn't eat much for dinner.

657
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,210
If you get caught,

658
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,140
- say it's for you.
 -  What?

659
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,310
Yes, Sir.

660
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,740
It's so hot.

661
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,980
It's hot, so take your time.

662
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,540
It looks delicious.

663
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,140
- Where's the spoon?
 -  Sorry.

664
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,840
I'll get one for you.

665
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,240
Forget it. I have one somewhere.

666
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,210
Here it is.

667
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,710
- Go and lock the door.
 -  Yes, Sir.

668
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,060
Ma'am! It's your wife.

669
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,830
What are you doing?

670
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,870
Let me in!

671
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,040
Open up!

672
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,470
Let me in!

673
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,870
Ma'am.

674
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,410
What were you trying to keep from me?

675
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,540
Look at me.

676
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,240
What is it now?

677
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,840
Did you eat patjuk?

678
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,910
What nonsense is that?

679
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,170
Hey, get her out of here!

680
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,870
Then what is this?

681
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,770
Did you want it enough to steal some?

682
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,240
I did not...

683
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,140
No one stole anything!

684
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,140
Why are you hiding that?

685
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,510
That's my portion, Ma'am.

686
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,640
How dare you? Get out of here!

687
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440
Honey.

688
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,510
Let's stop fighting.

689
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,470
There isn't much to life.

690
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:52,140
Enjoy my food, grow old in comfort and die peacefully.

691
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,840
What?

692
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,240
Now that the general meeting's coming up,

693
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:57,970
are you afraid?

694
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,670
You can live happily...

695
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,310
as long as you don't want your title back.

696
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,240
Do you want me...

697
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:08,690
to give up being chairman?

698
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,210
You know very well that...

699
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:13,070
if I fight tooth and nail, you can't come back.

700
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,410
Fight the best you can. If you can't stop me,

701
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,740
you'll wish you were rather dead.

702
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,340
This is me...

703
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,240
making a peace offering for the last time.

704
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:25,910
I want us to reconcile.

705
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,840
It's too late.

706
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,410
Let's fight to the end.

707
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,810
Very well, then.

708
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,940
To the end, it is.

709
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,670
I will amend my will.

710
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,210
Call Lawyer Kang.

711
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,710
He sided with your wife.

712
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:56,540
He can't be trusted.

713
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,410
Then call Gun Woo.

714
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,740
Tell him to find me a lawyer I can trust.

715
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,440
Yes, Sir.

716
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,770
That witch.

717
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,010
(Police Station)

718
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,740
Is it true that you settled with the assailant?

719
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,110
Not only that,

720
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,430
I handed in a petition requesting he be punished leniently.

721
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,650
Why?

722
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,610
He lives with his elderly mother and young children.

723
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,800
They're poor, too, so if he goes to prison,

724
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,900
no one can support the family.

725
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,080
Did your wife agree to this?

726
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,170
She's the one who came up with the idea.

727
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,170
I promised to work for and support the poor.

728
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,870
She told me I shouldn't ignore the plight of a desperate man.

729
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,070
Your approval rating soared. How do you feel?

730
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,140
I did what was right and natural.

731
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,740
I'm lost for words that the public thought highly of it.

732
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,990
Was his wife's surgery fake?

733
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,740
Yes, we can trust the tip.

734
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,870
Then the whole attack could have been staged.

735
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,510
We both know him well.

736
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,370
He would never forgive anyone.

737
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,670
I want to meet the assailant.

738
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,510
Do you want to use him?

739
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,170
If it was staged, he took a fee.

740
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,140
Someone bought by money can be bought again with ease.

741
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,970
I will arrange a meeting.

742
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,140
I work for the people.

743
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,810
Candidate number three, Byun Il Jae.

744
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,770
That's me. Remember who I am.

745
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,320
Vote me in as your next mayor.

746
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,340
Candidate number three, Byun Il Jae.

747
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,940
Independent candidate Byun Il Jae is gaining support.

748
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,480
His approval rating has risen 10 percent higher than last week's.

749
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,410
He's right behind Lee Jong Cheol who is currently in the lead.

750
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,440
For now...

751
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,770
It was all worthwhile.

752
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,210
It's now down to the swing votes.

753
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,070
That will make or break us.

754
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,710
How long must I stay here?

755
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,410
Not for long.

756
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,570
The swing votes...

757
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,710
are up to you.

758
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,340
Gi Tan approached the man we hired.

759
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,880
Are you sure?

760
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,970
Someone called Moon Tae Gwang asked for his help.

761
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,870
- What now?
 -  They'll meet this evening.

762
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,010
Okay, Father. I will.

763
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,310
Can you do something for me?

764
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,110
My father wants to amend his will...

765
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,840
and he needs a trustworthy lawyer.

766
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,140
Could you help him?

767
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,010
That's my duty.

768
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,640
I'm Dodo's legal counsel.

769
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,170
Hello, Mr Kim.

770
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,340
I'm nearly there.

771
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,010
Bye.

772
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,210
Will the gathering end late?

773
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,500
TV station people love to drink.

774
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,500
It'll rain later. Shall I come for you?

775
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,570
I'm not a kid. I don't need to be dropped off and picked up.

776
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:59,070
Don't drink too much. Call me when you get home.

777
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,560
Stop nagging.

778
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,870
You're our legal counsel. You're very important.

779
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,710
- See you.
 -  Bye.

780
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,140
The restaurant's somewhere nearby.

781
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,710
I'm here.

782
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,210
Where's the restaurant?

783
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:47,940
Is he there yet?

784
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,470
I'll be there.

785
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,570
Gi Tan.

786
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,910
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

787
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,770
It was him.

788
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,670
Gi Tan.

789
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,640
When someone comes in,

790
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,410
you should offer them a seat.

791
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,950
Did you invite Mr Hwang as well?

792
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,440
I only invited the man he hired.

793
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,510
Showing up when you aren't invited.

794
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,670
Isn't that your speciality?

795
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,240
You're here, there, everywhere.

796
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,770
Your presence...

797
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,140
proved two things.

798
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,470
That you staged the attack on your own daughter,

799
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,040
and that it was your idea and not your son-in-law's.

800
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,340
Add one more thing to that list.

801
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,110
Now that...

802
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,670
I got involved,

803
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,350
there's no way you can win this fight.

804
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,810
I'll add to that.

805
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,740
The second you came in,

806
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:30,510
your dream of becoming president went out the window.

807
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,670
What you just said...

808
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,740
was better off unsaid.

809
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,770
It's the one comment...

810
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,010
you'll regret ever making.

811
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,140
Give up on Il Jae now.

812
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,140
If you don't,

813
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,240
you will regret it for the rest of your life.

814
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,670
Like you did with the defence industry case.

815
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,240
I am...

816
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,240
not at all like Il Jae.

817
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,110
You will realise that...

818
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,510
not so long from now.

819
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,110
I think we poked too large a beehive.

820
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,010
No poking means no honey.

821
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,010
If he keeps defending Il Jae,

822
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,740
he will have to go.

823
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,640
Will you attend the entrepreneur's meeting?

824
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,340
I might as well.

825
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,540
(Producer Kim)

826
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,740
(Missed calls)

827
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,510
Why is she standing there in the rain?

828
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:24,110
I don't know. It seems like she's looking for someone.

829
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,380
Congratulations.

830
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,970
Your approval rating went up.

831
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,810
It's all because of you.

832
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:44,170
Thank you.

833
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,240
You must miss me because I'm not at home.

834
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,970
Don't worry about me and get well soon.

835
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,410
There's nothing to get well from.

836
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,940
What about food? Do you eat out?

837
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,010
Honey.

838
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,240
Are you listening?

839
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:17,180
- Honey?
 -  Yes.

840
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,970
I eat out sometimes. I'm managing.

841
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,150
Tell Chae Ryung to cook once in a while.

842
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,920
You need to eat at home.

843
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,740
I'll do that. I have to hang up now.

844
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,570
Bye.

845
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:32,840
I love you.

846
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,170
I know. Me, too.

847
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,040
Chae Ryung.

848
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,440
Check if you hung up first.

849
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,840
You're too cheeky.

850
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,870
Dinner's ready. Come and eat.

851
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,240
Try this.

852
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:18,550
You should join us.

853
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,640
Don't worry about me.

854
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,210
You're a good cook.

855
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,110
I can cook whenever you ask me to.

856
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,240
Right.

857
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:40,240
Here's your speech for tomorrow.

858
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,670
You'll be in a rich neighbourhood, so it mentions safety and welfare.

859
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,140
Well done.

860
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,010
Chae Ryung.

861
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,040
What are you up to?

862
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:10,970
Stop it.

863
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:13,710
Stop what?

864
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,940
Your people locked me up and almost killed me.

865
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,140
Whatever you do,

866
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:19,010
I don't trust you.

867
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:21,720
So what?

868
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,070
I won't let you...

869
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,240
toy with Mr Byun.

870
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:33,570
Are you afraid I'll take your job?

871
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,100
What?

872
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,310
Get a grip.

873
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,560
You and I are from two different classes.

874
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,610
Hey, Chae Ryung.

875
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,640
Do you want to see who he drops first?

876
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,510
If you want to be loyal,

877
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:52,010
see what your boss wants to see, not what you want.

878
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:54,840
Your eyes, nose, mouth and ears.

879
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,140
They all exist for your boss.

880
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:00,810
Do you get that, kid?

881
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,390
What do you mean?

882
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,070
Soo Yeon's missing?

883
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:33,640
She didn't show up to the dinner.

884
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,990
It's pouring and she won't answer her phone.

885
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,170
Goodness. I don't know where she is.

886
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,910
Okay. I'll look for her.

887
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:08,670
Gi Tan.

888
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:22,770
Are you tired?

889
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,410
The few drinks I had...

890
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,310
made me sleepy.

891
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,010
That woman.

892
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,240
She's still there.

893
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:35,770
You're right.

894
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:38,570
Is something wrong?

895
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,640
Lawyer Oh. Wake up.

896
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,010
Soo Yeon!

897
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:27,770
Gi Tan.

898
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,430
(Monster)

899
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:04,170
We showed all our cards.

900
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,540
- Say no.
 -  Dig him up by the roots.

901
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,230
So that there's nothing left.

902
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:11,820
It'll be harder to get my revenge if he becomes mayor.

903
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:16,140
Ga Din, you finally fell for me, didn't you?

904
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,830
I'm sure it was Gi Tan.

905
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:20,710
Do you miss him that much?

906
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,200
Say what you want now.

907
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,310
Soon, you'll be crawling before me.
