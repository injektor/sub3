157
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,130
<font color="yellow">of Director Jung due to dispute over assets.</font>

158
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,770
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,230
<font color="yellow">What is she talking about in front of Il Jae?</font>

160
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,280
<font color="yellow">- Il Jae looks really bitter.
-  After that, Lee ran away from...</font>

161
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,660
<font color="yellow">the hospital, and he jumped into Han River.</font>

162
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,960
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

163
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,000
<font color="yellow">I don't think that case is suitable for this television programme.</font>

164
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,500
<font color="yellow">I plan on going over basic laws about inheritance...</font>

165
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,960
<font color="yellow">and succession of property.</font>

166
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,730
<font color="yellow">Please continue.</font>

167
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,900
<font color="yellow">You already have over 10,000 comments on our website.</font>

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,060
<font color="yellow">Lee Guk Cheol was 19 years old then.</font>

169
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,660
<font color="yellow">He was blind.</font>

170
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,860
<font color="yellow">The police said that it was a dispute over assets,</font>

171
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,270
<font color="yellow">but he was already the heir to Sudo Hospital...</font>

172
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,500
<font color="yellow">once he came of age.</font>

173
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,030
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that there was no reason...</font>

174
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,800
<font color="yellow">for his murdering his aunt?</font>

175
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,030
<font color="yellow">One funny thing is that...</font>

176
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,630
<font color="yellow">there is someone else who benefited from all this.</font>

177
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,770
<font color="yellow">Who would that be?</font>

178
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,930
<font color="yellow">It was Director Jung's husband...</font>

179
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,030
<font color="yellow">who has no blood relations to Lee Guk Cheol.</font>

180
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,460
<font color="yellow">That crazy...</font>

181
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

182
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,530
<font color="yellow">No, I wasn't talking about you.</font>

183
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,850
<font color="yellow">Did you eat something rotten for lunch?</font>

184
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,530
<font color="yellow">You have a foul mouth for someone in politics.</font>

185
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,360
<font color="yellow">A lot of people are curious about what the uncle is doing now.</font>

186
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,400
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, we can't share that with you.</font>

187
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,000
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun.</font>

188
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,000
<font color="yellow">It's your last show and all.</font>

189
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,060
<font color="yellow">Why don't you tell our audience the truth?</font>

190
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,700
<font color="yellow">Is it someone you know as well?</font>

191
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,830
<font color="yellow">He knows him very well.</font>

192
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,430
<font color="yellow">Could I tell them?</font>

193
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,960
<font color="yellow">It's a hurtful memory,</font>

194
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,900
<font color="yellow">so I've managed to forget about it.</font>

195
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,130
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Guk Cheol's uncle.</font>

196
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,660
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

197
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,360
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon is...</font>

198
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,910
<font color="yellow">really putting Il Jae on the spot.</font>

199
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,130
<font color="yellow">We just received a question.</font>

200
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,930
<font color="yellow">"What if the inheritance has been processed, but the deceased...</font>

201
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,260
<font color="yellow">ends up coming back? What happens then?"</font>

202
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,900
<font color="yellow">Who will answer this question?</font>

203
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,230
<font color="yellow">Since it's your last show,</font>

204
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,160
<font color="yellow">you should go ahead.</font>

205
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
<font color="yellow">- Good work.
-  Thank you.</font>

206
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,660
<font color="yellow">- Be careful.
-  Are you all right?</font>

207
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,900
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

208
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,970
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

209
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,200
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get fired after one show?</font>

210
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,530
<font color="yellow">The station is going crazy saying that it's an invasion of privacy.</font>

211
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,870
<font color="yellow">If they don't like it,</font>

212
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,700
<font color="yellow">I'll just quit.</font>

213
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,800
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. I felt good watching you talk like that,</font>

214
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,800
<font color="yellow">but it's too reckless.</font>

215
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,660
<font color="yellow">Even if I'm reckless,</font>

216
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,760
<font color="yellow">I'm not as bad as someone else.</font>

217
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,360
<font color="yellow">I know, but...</font>

218
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,560
<font color="yellow">I give up. It'll work out.</font>

219
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,400
<font color="yellow">You did well. You did great.</font>

220
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,330
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

221
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,230
<font color="yellow">Can we...</font>

222
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,400
<font color="yellow">talk in private?</font>

223
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,730
<font color="yellow">You surprised me twice today.</font>

224
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,450
<font color="yellow">Once by showing up as a lawyer...</font>

225
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,760
<font color="yellow">and then once again when you spoke so boldly on television.</font>

226
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,000
<font color="yellow">If you were surprised by just that,</font>

227
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,800
<font color="yellow">you better brace yourself for the future.</font>

228
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,430
<font color="yellow">If you brought up Guk Cheol's case...</font>

229
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,730
<font color="yellow">to give me a hard time, you should give up now.</font>

230
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,190
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard you try,</font>

231
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,000
<font color="yellow">you won't find anything. It's clean.</font>

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,700
<font color="yellow">It may be clean on paper, but what about morally?</font>

233
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,660
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

234
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,230
<font color="yellow">the good image you've built up on the show...</font>

235
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,360
<font color="yellow">will shatter into pieces.</font>

236
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,630
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

237
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,030
<font color="yellow">Talking a lot and talking well are two different things.</font>

238
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,830
<font color="yellow">Troubles...</font>

239
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,630
<font color="yellow">will always start from one's mouth.</font>

240
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,330
<font color="yellow">I'm a lawyer.</font>

241
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,660
<font color="yellow">I make money with words. What else can I do?</font>

242
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,030
<font color="yellow">Do you still think...</font>

243
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,600
<font color="yellow">that I killed Dong Soo?</font>

244
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,230
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

245
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,130
<font color="yellow">for still remembering...</font>

246
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,300
<font color="yellow">my brother's name.</font>

247
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,960
<font color="yellow">I don't have time to meddle with people like you.</font>

248
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,550
<font color="yellow">You better not get in my way.</font>

249
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,530
<font color="yellow">If something happens to me,</font>

250
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,900
<font color="yellow">you will be the number one suspect.</font>

251
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,400
<font color="yellow">I've already set up everything...</font>

252
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,360
<font color="yellow">with the police, prosecutors and the television show.</font>

253
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,240
<font color="yellow">Not bad.</font>

254
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,100
<font color="yellow">I learned it from you.</font>

255
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,740
<font color="yellow">You taught me how to ruin someone...</font>

256
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,830
<font color="yellow">and not get a peep out of them.</font>

257
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,700
<font color="yellow">And also where to stab to make them bleed the most.</font>

258
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,550
<font color="yellow">And how pathetic and upsetting it is to be unable...</font>

259
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,700
<font color="yellow">to stand up for yourself.</font>

260
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,200
<font color="yellow">I learned it all from you.</font>

261
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,630
<font color="yellow">The world is...</font>

262
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,260
<font color="yellow">more complicated and scary than you think.</font>

263
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,830
<font color="yellow">By the time you realise that,</font>

264
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,930
<font color="yellow">you would have...</font>

265
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,830
<font color="yellow">already ruined your life.</font>

266
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,530
<font color="yellow">I hear you're going to try for the mayor of Seoul.</font>

267
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,330
<font color="yellow">I hope...</font>

268
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,800
<font color="yellow">you manage to go up as high as possible.</font>

269
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,130
<font color="yellow">Because I'll make sure you fall down hard.</font>

270
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,930
<font color="yellow">Hang in there.</font>

271
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,230
<font color="yellow">Someone will be here soon to help you.</font>

272
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,960
<font color="yellow">Professor.</font>

273
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,900
<font color="yellow">I have a favour to ask before you treat the patient.</font>

274
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,460
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

275
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,630
<font color="yellow">Please erase his memories of "Oh Soo Yeon".</font>

276
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,660
<font color="yellow">Her name used to be "Cha Jeong Eun".</font>

277
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,300
<font color="yellow">Erase any memories of her...</font>

278
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
<font color="yellow">along with any feelings associated with her.</font>

279
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,660
<font color="yellow">What's the reason?</font>

280
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,660
<font color="yellow">He's suffering because of her.</font>

281
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,860
<font color="yellow">If he forgets about her,</font>

282
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,530
<font color="yellow">it'll be easier for him to get better.</font>

283
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,460
<font color="yellow">I'll try.</font>

284
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,360
<font color="yellow">Kang Gi Tan.</font>

285
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,320
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

286
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,000
<font color="yellow">I'm here to heal you.</font>

287
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
<font color="yellow">First, put your mind at ease.</font>

288
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,970
<font color="yellow">Look carefully at this watch.</font>

289
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,000
<font color="yellow">Can you see the time?</font>

290
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

291
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,530
<font color="yellow">When this watch stops, your time will go backwards.</font>

292
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,630
<font color="yellow">Time...</font>

293
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,600
<font color="yellow">is moving backwards.</font>

294
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,970
<font color="yellow">Now, close your eyes.</font>

295
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,360
<font color="yellow">You're going back into your past.</font>

296
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,260
<font color="yellow">What do you see?</font>

297
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,330
<font color="yellow">I am eating a meal with my family.</font>

298
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,860
<font color="yellow">Were you happy?</font>

299
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,880
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

300
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,560
<font color="yellow">Why did that happiness disappear?</font>

301
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

302
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,950
<font color="yellow">What's with you? Are you insane?</font>

303
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

304
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
<font color="yellow">My uncle...</font>

305
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,260
<font color="yellow">killed...</font>

306
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,760
<font color="yellow">my parents.</font>

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,030
<font color="yellow">What happened to you afterwards?</font>

308
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,160
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae tried to kill me.</font>

309
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,330
<font color="yellow">I was reborn...</font>

310
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,160
<font color="yellow">as Kang Gi Tan to get my revenge.</font>

311
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,470
<font color="yellow">It will hurt you a lot...</font>

312
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,030
<font color="yellow">to get revenge on someone.</font>

313
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,930
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

314
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,160
<font color="yellow">Are there any good memories?</font>

315
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly crying?</font>

316
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,230
<font color="yellow">There is someone I love.</font>

317
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,630
<font color="yellow">It lasted very shortly,</font>

318
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,160
<font color="yellow">but that was the happiest moment of my life.</font>

319
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,260
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

320
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,030
<font color="yellow">your memories are...</font>

321
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,760
<font color="yellow">perfectly in order.</font>

322
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,360
<font color="yellow">Do you see that bullet stuck in your head?</font>

323
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

324
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,230
<font color="yellow">That bullet...</font>

325
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,060
<font color="yellow">erased...</font>

326
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,760
<font color="yellow">the name Oh Soo Yeon from your memory.</font>

327
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,830
<font color="yellow">You do not have...</font>

328
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,260
<font color="yellow">any memories...</font>

329
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,330
<font color="yellow">regarding Cha Jeong Eun...</font>

330
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,030
<font color="yellow">or Oh Soo Yeon in your head.</font>

331
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

332
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,600
<font color="yellow">your headache will disappear, too.</font>

333
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,560
<font color="yellow">You will go into...</font>

334
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,530
<font color="yellow">a deep sleep.</font>

335
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
<font color="yellow">Yes, sure.</font>

336
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,360
<font color="yellow">- Sure.
-  I'm back.</font>

337
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,430
<font color="yellow">You should work harder if we're paying you so much.</font>

338
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,960
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

339
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,950
<font color="yellow">- I wasn't slacking off.
-  Are you talking back to me?</font>

340
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,970
<font color="yellow">Did you find anything?</font>

341
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,520
<font color="yellow">I asked this directly to the legal team of Dodo Group.</font>

342
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,260
<font color="yellow">The contract with their current lawyer is definitely over.</font>

343
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,700
<font color="yellow">Why did you find that out?</font>

344
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,970
<font color="yellow">Tell me more about their situation.</font>

345
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,710
<font color="yellow">Didn't you get the order to change the company's lawyer?</font>

346
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,860
<font color="yellow">He's been doing well so far. Why is that necessary?</font>

347
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,230
<font color="yellow">It's my order!</font>

348
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,000
<font color="yellow">Do you need another reason?</font>

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,660
<font color="yellow">I also have the right to decide.</font>

350
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,260
<font color="yellow">You should respect my opinion, too.</font>

351
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,470
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gun Woo.</font>

352
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,930
<font color="yellow">You must trust your board very much,</font>

353
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,400
<font color="yellow">but I am the chairwoman.</font>

354
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,160
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can outdo me?</font>

355
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,300
<font color="yellow">You forgot the word "temporary". You're a temporary chairman.</font>

356
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

357
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,160
<font color="yellow">Once Father comes back, you'll have to leave.</font>

358
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,400
<font color="yellow">It's been a year since he left.</font>

359
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,250
<font color="yellow">That may as well become 10 years.</font>

360
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,260
<font color="yellow">It's as if...</font>

361
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,400
<font color="yellow">you wish that he would never return.</font>

362
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,830
<font color="yellow">I have no time to fight with you.</font>

363
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,130
<font color="yellow">Follow my orders.</font>

364
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,570
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will recruit someone openly.</font>

365
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,300
<font color="yellow">But do remember that I prefer to renew the current contract.</font>

366
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,160
<font color="yellow">There's a war between Chairwoman and Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo.</font>

367
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,830
<font color="yellow">That means, Vice Chairman Do's power has grown.</font>

368
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,460
<font color="yellow">What do we have in common with Dodo Group's...</font>

369
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,200
<font color="yellow">corporate lawyer position?</font>

370
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,960
<font color="yellow">Which side is CEO Do Gwang Woo for?</font>

371
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, don't worry, Lawyer Choi.</font>

372
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,500
<font color="yellow">You will definitely become the corporate lawyer.</font>

373
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,060
<font color="yellow">I'll call you back.</font>

374
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,760
<font color="yellow">Are you referring to...</font>

375
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,530
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Choi Guk Jo of Cheonmyeong Law Firm?</font>

376
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,360
<font color="yellow">You're very quick to catch onto things.</font>

377
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,050
<font color="yellow">You're really fast.</font>

378
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,000
<font color="yellow">They were recently involved in a rebate scandal.</font>

379
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,300
<font color="yellow">Who cares?</font>

380
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,730
<font color="yellow">If we like him, we can work with him.</font>

381
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

382
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,840
<font color="yellow">Why do you think?</font>

383
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,430
<font color="yellow">I want to cut off your arms and legs,</font>

384
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,600
<font color="yellow">and place people from my side there.</font>

385
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
<font color="yellow">You know this already.</font>

386
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,400
<font color="yellow">Arms, legs, arms and legs.</font>

387
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,860
<font color="yellow">We will also apply for the position.</font>

388
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,530
<font color="yellow">Fill out the necessary papers and apply.</font>

389
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,900
<font color="yellow">Okay, Soo Yeon.</font>

390
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

391
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,780
<font color="yellow">A lot of high-profile lawyers will apply for the position.</font>

392
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,840
<font color="yellow">Do you think we'll make it?</font>

393
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,050
<font color="yellow">You have to try to see what happens.</font>

394
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,160
<font color="yellow">You don't need to try anything this obvious.</font>

395
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,630
<font color="yellow">If we do get the position, this will be a huge success for us.</font>

396
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,430
<font color="yellow">I know that, too.</font>

397
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,830
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

398
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,460
<font color="yellow">You're doing this because Il Jae is on their board.</font>

399
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,700
<font color="yellow">Is that wrong?</font>

400
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,860
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying that it's wrong.</font>

401
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,830
<font color="yellow">I'm worried you'll get embarrassed for trying something impossible...</font>

402
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,990
<font color="yellow">because of your hard feelings.</font>

403
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,630
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't give it a shot unless I saw a possibility.</font>

404
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,360
<font color="yellow">I have everything planned out.</font>

405
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,030
<font color="yellow">Just stick with me.</font>

406
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,060
<font color="yellow">My gosh, I chose the wrong partner.</font>

407
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,630
<font color="yellow">She's practically my boss.</font>

408
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,460
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

409
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,700
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

410
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
<font color="yellow">Is Gi Tan still asleep?</font>

411
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,500
<font color="yellow">It's been three days already. I'm worried.</font>

412
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,660
<font color="yellow">- Gi Tan.
-  Are you awake?</font>

413
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,440
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

414
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,830
<font color="yellow">You're in China.</font>

415
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,100
<font color="yellow">China?</font>

416
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,830
<font color="yellow">Don't strain yourself.</font>

417
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,960
<font color="yellow">You were lying in bed for a year.</font>

418
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
<font color="yellow">A year?</font>

419
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,500
<font color="yellow">Has it been a year already?</font>

420
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,600
<font color="yellow">Drink this.</font>

421
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,930
<font color="yellow">It will clear up your mind.</font>

422
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,500
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what happened in that year?</font>

423
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,660
<font color="yellow">I heard it from Sung Ae.</font>

424
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,860
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saving my life.</font>

425
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,430
<font color="yellow">You must be very weak because you were bedridden for a year.</font>

426
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,360
<font color="yellow">You should focus on getting your body back in shape.</font>

427
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,030
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

428
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,200
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to you in private.</font>

429
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,860
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

430
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,800
<font color="yellow">step in to take the bullet instead of me?</font>

431
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,100
<font color="yellow">I once tried to kill you.</font>

432
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,410
<font color="yellow">So why did you save me...</font>

433
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,960
<font color="yellow">while risking your own life?</font>

434
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,630
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

435
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,400
<font color="yellow">"Just because"?</font>

436
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,430
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

437
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,560
<font color="yellow">I just did as my heart told me.</font>

438
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,500
<font color="yellow">Hearts never move without a reason.</font>

439
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,600
<font color="yellow">Your heart will only move if you and I have...</font>

440
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,800
<font color="yellow">a special relationship in this life...</font>

441
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,100
<font color="yellow">or in our lives before.</font>

442
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,860
<font color="yellow">What will you do after you get well?</font>

443
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,630
<font color="yellow">I'll go back to Korea...</font>

444
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,300
<font color="yellow">to finish my revenge on Il Jae.</font>

445
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,460
<font color="yellow">Just like you,</font>

446
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,430
<font color="yellow">I also lost my family.</font>

447
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,200
<font color="yellow">We were on a vacation to Turkey about 20 years ago.</font>

448
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,700
<font color="yellow">The moment I got out of my car to get my passport which I forgot,</font>

449
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,400
<font color="yellow">the car blew up.</font>

450
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,830
<font color="yellow">My old mother,</font>

451
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,160
<font color="yellow">children and wife were...</font>

452
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,460
<font color="yellow">sitting in that car.</font>

453
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,900
<font color="yellow">I sold their government some missiles,</font>

454
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,360
<font color="yellow">so the rebel army got their revenge on me.</font>

455
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,760
<font color="yellow">Since then,</font>

456
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,660
<font color="yellow">I have never had a family.</font>

457
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,960
<font color="yellow">Just like you, Gi Tan.</font>

458
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,300
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

459
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,360
<font color="yellow">I can understand how you feel.</font>

460
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,060
<font color="yellow">I don't have...</font>

461
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,800
<font color="yellow">much to live.</font>

462
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,500
<font color="yellow">I also have fragments of a bomb...</font>

463
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,300
<font color="yellow">stuck near my heart.</font>

464
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,160
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it,</font>

465
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,800
<font color="yellow">you and I have a lot in common.</font>

466
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,260
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

467
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,060
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

468
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,430
<font color="yellow">What do you think...</font>

469
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,530
<font color="yellow">about becoming my son?</font>

470
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,930
<font color="yellow">You'd get a father, and I'd get a son.</font>

471
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,030
<font color="yellow">I want to have a family before I die...</font>

472
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,260
<font color="yellow">so that someone would at least come to my grave.</font>

473
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,460
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to pressure you.</font>

474
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,560
<font color="yellow">I'm only saying it...</font>

475
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,300
<font color="yellow">because my heart's telling me to.</font>

476
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,660
<font color="yellow">If you decline,</font>

477
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,830
<font color="yellow">that's where our fate ends. It can't be helped.</font>

479
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,430

484
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,530
<font color="yellow">Min and Oh Law Firm is supposed to go first,</font>

485
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,460
<font color="yellow">but they're not here yet.</font>

486

<font color="yellow">Min and Oh Law Firm?</font>

487
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,260
<font color="yellow">That sounds familiar.</font>

-  Okay.</font>

489

495
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,360
<font color="yellow">Right, Min and Oh Law Firm. I saw you on television.</font>

496
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,430
<font color="yellow">Since they just got here, let's change their order to the back.</font>

497
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,930
<font color="yellow">It's their fault for being late. We'll just go as is.</font>

498
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,330
<font color="yellow">You may start the presentation.</font>

<font color="yellow">Min and Oh Law Firm...</font>

502
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,030
<font color="yellow">was founded earlier this year...</font>

503
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,260

<font color="yellow">No, we don't.</font>

505
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,560
<font color="yellow">There's no need to hear any more from you. Next.</font>

<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman Do...</font>

507
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,700
<font color="yellow">I want to hear more.</font>

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,000
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh, please continue. Min and Oh Law Firm.</font>

509
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,400
<font color="yellow">We're new and might not have as much experience,</font>

510
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,900
<font color="yellow">but our success rate is over 90 percent.</font>

511
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,540
<font color="yellow">It looks like...</font>

512
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,660
<font color="yellow">all of the cases you've won are worth under 10,000 dollars.</font>

513
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,700
<font color="yellow">Even so, a success rate of 90 percent is quite extraordinary.</font>

514
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,560
<font color="yellow">I think you guys are competent enough.</font>

515
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,530
<font color="yellow">Legal disputes between companies...</font>

516
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,120
<font color="yellow">can range from millions to billions of dollars.</font>

517
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,830
<font color="yellow">Just because you owned a small shop...</font>

518
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,160
<font color="yellow">doesn't mean we can let you manage a department store.</font>

519
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,400
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that we're not competent enough?</font>

520
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,260
<font color="yellow">We're short on time. Next.</font>

521
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,330
<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman Do.</font>

522
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,630
<font color="yellow">Please step down.</font>

523
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,930
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,700
<font color="yellow">Once we come to a decision, we'll contact each firm.</font>

526
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

527
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,030
<font color="yellow">Wait for me outside.</font>

528
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,830
<font color="yellow">I'll be in the parking lot.</font>

529
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,100
<font color="yellow">Can we talk?</font>

530
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
<font color="yellow">When's my next meeting?</font>

531
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,060
<font color="yellow">It's after lunch at 3pm.</font>

532
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,460
<font color="yellow">I agree that we don't have enough experience.</font>

533
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,560
<font color="yellow">However, I cannot agree that we're not competent enough.</font>

534
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,710
<font color="yellow">That's for me to decide, not you.</font>

535
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,800
<font color="yellow">Then you should look into everything before making a decision.</font>

536
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,600
<font color="yellow">I've already made my decision. You didn't make it.</font>

537
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,260
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo's not the type...</font>

538
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,530
<font color="yellow">to be generous.</font>

539
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,760
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have lunch with me?</font>

540
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
<font color="yellow">Who knows?</font>

541
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,030
<font color="yellow">If you're good to me,</font>

542
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,660
<font color="yellow">maybe I'll help you become our lawyer.</font>

543
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,400
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you the debt and interest on time this month.</font>

544
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,100
<font color="yellow">Right, right. I forgot about that.</font>

545
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not so good with small numbers.</font>

546
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,630
<font color="yellow">So what do you like to eat?</font>

547
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,370
<font color="yellow">We can drive out to Yangpyeong...</font>

548
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,600
<font color="yellow">Or maybe somewhere closer? Hello?</font>

549
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,900
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

550
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,930
<font color="yellow">I wish I could make her come to my side.</font>

551
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,200
<font color="yellow">You don't plan on recommending her...</font>

552
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,130
<font color="yellow">for our legal advisor, do you?</font>

553
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,300
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

554
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not a pushover.</font>

555
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,600
<font color="yellow">I saw her ripping Il Jae apart on television last time.</font>

556
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,930
<font color="yellow">It made me become interested in her.</font>

557
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,330
<font color="yellow">Whenever I think about that contract I have with Il Jae,</font>

558
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,390
<font color="yellow">it makes me angry down to my bones.</font>

559
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,760
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you to read the contract carefully.</font>

560
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,430
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing that up?</font>

561
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,430
<font color="yellow">Anyway...</font>

562
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,330
<font color="yellow">If Soo Yeon...</font>

563
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,760
<font color="yellow">joins Dodo Group,</font>

564
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,370
<font color="yellow">it'll be a war between her and Il Jae.</font>

565
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,900
<font color="yellow">May I sit for a minute?</font>

566
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,600
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be disturbed.</font>

567
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,130
<font color="yellow">I came up with a strategy for you to win with the appeal.</font>

568
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,930
<font color="yellow">Give me a chance to show you what I can do.</font>

569
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,130
<font color="yellow">If we lose any of the trials,</font>

570
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,500
<font color="yellow">I won't ask you to sign with us.</font>

571
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,760
<font color="yellow">There's no point in doing this. You should give up.</font>

572
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,660
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

573
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,630
<font color="yellow">Even if it's just once,</font>

574
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,870
<font color="yellow">please look at these documents before making up your mind.</font>

575
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
<font color="yellow">I will not give up.</font>

576
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,660
<font color="yellow">Have a good night, Sir.</font>

577
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,560
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, you...</font>

578
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,030
<font color="yellow">Just read it.</font>

579
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,660
<font color="yellow">See what strategy my law firm came up with.</font>

580
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,930
<font color="yellow">Why do want to be our legal counsel?</font>

581
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,600
<font color="yellow">You acted like you never wanted to see me again.</font>

582
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,760
<font color="yellow">What is this about?</font>

583
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,560
<font color="yellow">I want to make Il Jae pay.</font>

584
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,130
<font color="yellow">I will destroy everything he has.</font>

585
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,700
<font color="yellow">So that's it.</font>

586
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,300
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

587
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,150
<font color="yellow">are you going to use me to avenge your brother's death?</font>

588
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,780
<font color="yellow">It was your idea.</font>

589
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,900
<font color="yellow">You told me to use you. You said I could.</font>

590
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,130
<font color="yellow">You turned me down and made me feel miserable in the process!</font>

591
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,960
<font color="yellow">I was powerless then.</font>

592
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,930
<font color="yellow">There was nothing I could do.</font>

593
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,560
<font color="yellow">But not any more.</font>

594
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,460
<font color="yellow">With someone's help,</font>

595
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,600
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

596
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,500
<font color="yellow">Because I am...</font>

597
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,560
<font color="yellow">not who I used to be.</font>

598
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,370
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

599
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,660
<font color="yellow">Then you must act differently, too.</font>

600
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,630
<font color="yellow">You aren't the only one who has changed.</font>

601
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,900
<font color="yellow">I don't care about you any more.</font>

602
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,230
<font color="yellow">So get out of my life.</font>

603
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,370
<font color="yellow">Stop bothering me.</font>

604
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,700
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have started this...</font>

605
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,530
<font color="yellow">if I were to give up so easily.</font>

606
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,370
<font color="yellow">I will keep going.</font>

607
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,230
<font color="yellow">Even if I end up in a fire pit.</font>

608

<font color="yellow">(Dodo Group)</font>

609
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,420
<font color="yellow">Shin Young, are you trying to bankrupt our hotel?</font>

610
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,190
<font color="yellow">What's the problem now?</font>

611
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,630
<font color="yellow">I gave you a company against the board's advice.</font>

612
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,160
<font color="yellow">Don't make a mess of it.</font>

613
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,800
<font color="yellow">Sales of the first half of the year hit rock bottom.</font>

614
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,800
<font color="yellow">It's not just rock bottom, Mum. She's practically underground.</font>

615
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,730
<font color="yellow">Is it my fault that no one wants to stay?</font>

616
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,140
<font color="yellow">That's the last thing you should say.</font>

617
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,190
<font color="yellow">Look at Gwang Woo.</font>

618
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,230
<font color="yellow">Dodo Pharmaceutical's the most profitable in its industry.</font>

619
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,560
<font color="yellow">How is that down to him?</font>

620
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,620
<font color="yellow">It's because Gun Woo signed the deal for the new drug.</font>

<font color="yellow">do something before the next general meeting.</font>

623
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
<font color="yellow">I have some bad news.</font>

624
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,190
<font color="yellow">What could happen so early in the morning?</font>

625
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,660
<font color="yellow">I just got a call.</font>

626
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,930
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do just boarded his private jet to Korea.</font>

627
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

628
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,030
<font color="yellow">He's coming back?</font>

629
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,090
<font color="yellow">That's great. I missed him so much lately.</font>

630
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,430
<font color="yellow">It's not great at all. This could be a disaster.</font>

631
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,900
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

632
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,730
<font color="yellow">It's not like we did anything wrong.</font>

633
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,220
<font color="yellow">You and Gwang Woo...</font>

634
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,100
<font color="yellow">fired all of Dad's remaining allies.</font>

635
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,800
<font color="yellow">What if he collapses with shock again?</font>

636
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,230
<font color="yellow">The company's just fine, isn't it?</font>

637
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,110
<font color="yellow">Keep your chin up.</font>

638
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,630
<font color="yellow">We saved the company.</font>

639
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,930
<font color="yellow">Who sent him the private jet?</font>

640
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,930
<font color="yellow">I wonder.</font>

641
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,570
<font color="yellow">The doctor said...</font>

642
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,330
<font color="yellow">he hadn't recovered yet.</font>

643
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,780
<font color="yellow">Seeing how he cancelled all his morning appointments,</font>

644
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,510
<font color="yellow">I think it's Vice Chairman Do.</font>

645
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

646
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,370
<font color="yellow">How dare he?</font>

647
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,430
<font color="yellow">He's always the one to stir up trouble.</font>

648
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,230
<font color="yellow">Nothing works out when he's around.</font>

649
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,430
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

650
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,130
<font color="yellow">Hi, Gun Woo.</font>

651
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,930
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

652
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,100
<font color="yellow">My legs are still weak,</font>

653
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,890
<font color="yellow">but otherwise, I'm fine.</font>

654
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,060
<font color="yellow">I've missed you.</font>

655
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,630
<font color="yellow">I heard about...</font>

656
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,730
<font color="yellow">how things are.</font>

657
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,900
<font color="yellow">The shareholders...</font>

658
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,230
<font color="yellow">seem to trust you immensely.</font>

659
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,200
<font color="yellow">He must be tired. Take him home.</font>

660
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,430
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the company.</font>

661
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,810
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

662
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,630
<font color="yellow">Your doctor told you not to tire yourself out.</font>

663
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,870
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

664
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,230
<font color="yellow">Take me to Dodo.</font>

665
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,330
<font color="yellow">Did you tell them?</font>

666
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,160
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

667
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,530
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

668
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,430
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I've missed you?</font>

669
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,670
<font color="yellow">You've aged so much more since I last saw you.</font>

670
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,800
<font color="yellow">I'm not old.</font>

671
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,360
<font color="yellow">And I'm very healthy.</font>

672
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,870
<font color="yellow">Welcome back.</font>

673
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,230
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep a wink since I heard you'd be back.</font>

674
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,560
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I wasn't able to visit you, Father.</font>

<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

676
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,800
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

677
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,330
<font color="yellow">Can't we talk at home? I have work to do.</font>

678

680
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,800
<font color="yellow">You went from working at a sewing machine...</font>

681
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,160
<font color="yellow">to being called chairwoman of a huge company.</font>

682
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,730
<font color="yellow">What an improvement that is.</font>

683
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,630
<font color="yellow">Do you have to be so spiteful?</font>

684
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,130
<font color="yellow">I worked hard night and day to keep the company afloat.</font>

685
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,800
<font color="yellow">You had to fire all my allies and those loyal to me.</font>

686
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,730
<font color="yellow">I bet that kept you busy.</font>

<font color="yellow">Honey,</font>

688
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,730

<font color="yellow">This is your problem.</font>

702
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,610

00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,160
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,960

<font color="yellow">Resign right now...</font>

710
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,200
<font color="yellow">and go back to being the housewife you always were!</font>

711
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,060
<font color="yellow">I will start work tomorrow, okay?</font>

712
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,600
<font color="yellow">I won't let you.</font>

713
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,960
<font color="yellow">What do you think you can do now?</font>

714
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,720
<font color="yellow">What? Gwi Ja.</font>

715

<font color="yellow">Shall I show you how useless you are?</font>

721
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,360
<font color="yellow">Is anyone out there?</font>

724
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,060
<font color="yellow">You heard me. Take him home!</font>

725
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,060
<font color="yellow">Take him home.</font>

726
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,310
<font color="yellow">Hey! Get your hands off me!</font>

727
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,630

739
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,830
<font color="yellow">Were you always this good at kendo?</font>

740
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,500
<font color="yellow">I'm an expert.</font>

741
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:39,830
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you something.</font>

742
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,200
<font color="yellow">Did I ever...</font>

743
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,300
<font color="yellow">like you at one point?</font>

744
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,700
<font color="yellow">Do you still have memory issues?</font>

745
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,270
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

746
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,000
<font color="yellow">I remember everything clearly.</font>

747
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,760
<font color="yellow">How should I explain it?</font>

748
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,400
<font color="yellow">It's like...</font>

749
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,960
<font color="yellow">I think I liked someone very much.</font>

750
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,230
<font color="yellow">And was that me?</font>

751
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,500
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

752
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,000
<font color="yellow">What if it was?</font>

753
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,160
<font color="yellow">Can you like me?</font>

754
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,200
<font color="yellow">No. I'm sure it wasn't you.</font>

755
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,060
<font color="yellow">Then why ask? You ruined my mood.</font>

756
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,630
<font color="yellow">Your father calls, Sir.</font>

757
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,200
<font color="yellow">Can you stop being so polite?</font>

758
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,230
<font color="yellow">It's so awkward.</font>

759
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,100
<font color="yellow">You're my boss' son and second-in-command.</font>

760
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,900
<font color="yellow">Deal with it.</font>

761
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,500
<font color="yellow">See how things are in Seoul.</font>

762
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,930
<font color="yellow">I want to know everything about Il Jae.</font>

763

<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

764
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,860
<font color="yellow">Do you want to return to Korea?</font>

765
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,500
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

766
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,330
<font color="yellow">We were commissioned...</font>

767
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,700
<font color="yellow">to procure a large ship.</font>

768
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,620
<font color="yellow">Why don't you work on that while you're in Korea?</font>

769
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,530
<font color="yellow">Until I sort out my personal life,</font>

770
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,500
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can help you.</font>

771
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,100
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group applied...</font>

772
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,430
<font color="yellow">for the right to build the ship.</font>

773
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,060
<font color="yellow">Isn't Il Jae deeply involved with Dodo Group?</font>

774
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,110
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I can run a business and get my revenge?</font>

775
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,260
<font color="yellow">Il Jae...</font>

776
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,900
<font color="yellow">ruined my plans for the vaccine.</font>

777
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,700
<font color="yellow">Your revenge is now mine as well.</font>

778
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,830
<font color="yellow">I will do as you say, Father.</font>

779
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,660
<font color="yellow">Wait, stop, please.</font>

780
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,960
<font color="yellow">I only barely got this job.</font>

781
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,060
<font color="yellow">Please leave me alone.</font>

782
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,300
<font color="yellow">Then pay us what you owe.</font>

783
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,730
<font color="yellow">Do we look like pushovers to you?</font>

784
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:19,070
<font color="yellow">Wait, isn't that Tae Gwang?</font>

785
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,670
<font color="yellow">I'll sell my heart if I must to get you your money.</font>

786
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:23,730
<font color="yellow">So please.</font>

787
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,930
<font color="yellow">Please don't touch my family. Please...</font>

788
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,260
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

789
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,220
<font color="yellow">You have a week to pay the interest.</font>

790
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,600
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  If not,</font>

791
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,900
<font color="yellow">say goodbye...</font>

792
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,860
<font color="yellow">to your family in the Philippines.</font>

793
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,530
<font color="yellow">- Start paying me back.
-  I will.</font>

794
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,130
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

795
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,230
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

796
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,400
<font color="yellow">What a mess.</font>

797
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,460
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

798
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,230
<font color="yellow">Didn't you want to get back at me?</font>

799
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,530
<font color="yellow">All my life,</font>

800
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,030
<font color="yellow">I begged and grovelled to please you.</font>

801
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,060
<font color="yellow">So why should I suffer like this?</font>

802
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,760
<font color="yellow">You don't know what you did wrong.</font>

803
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,030
<font color="yellow">You took the wrong side.</font>

804
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,340
<font color="yellow">You should have begged me.</font>

805
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,830
<font color="yellow">Do you know what a crucial mistake it is to take the wrong side?</font>

806
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,860
<font color="yellow">For as long as I live,</font>

807
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,060
<font color="yellow">I will bring you down with my own hands.</font>

808
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,130
<font color="yellow">Do Gwang Woo...</font>

809
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,260
<font color="yellow">Give up.</font>

810
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,930
<font color="yellow">I don't like seeing you get beaten up.</font>

811
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,230
<font color="yellow">You used to be Chief Secretary.</font>

812
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:51,530
<font color="yellow">It's such an embarrassment.</font>

813
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,200
<font color="yellow">I won't die.</font>

814
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,930
<font color="yellow">I can't die...</font>

815
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,230
<font color="yellow">before I make you suffer as much as I did.</font>

816
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,700
<font color="yellow">Do Gwang Woo.</font>

817
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,000
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo kicked Tae Gwang out.</font>

818
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,660
<font color="yellow">He started selling fried chicken but went bankrupt.</font>

819
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,900
<font color="yellow">His wife divorced him over his debt,</font>

820
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,760
<font color="yellow">and now, he's a delinquent borrower.</font>

821
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,930
<font color="yellow">What about Lee Soo Tak?</font>

822
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,060
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

823
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:48,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you back again? Business is already slow.</font>

824
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,430
<font color="yellow">Give me some soju.</font>

825
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,260
<font color="yellow">Just one bottle.</font>

826
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,870
<font color="yellow">Let's start a business.</font>

827
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,030
<font color="yellow">Do you have the money?</font>

828
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,230
<font color="yellow">You're a delinquent borrower.</font>

829
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:11,560
<font color="yellow">I can still help bring in customers.</font>

830
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,160
<font color="yellow">The local gang trashed my place earlier today.</font>

831
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,600
<font color="yellow">I'll end up like you if I lose this.</font>

832
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,230
<font color="yellow">I don't know how we ended up like this.</font>

833
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,300
<font color="yellow">Do you want some chicken feet?</font>

834
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,230
<font color="yellow">Don't mention chicken. I lost everything frying chicken.</font>

835
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,000
<font color="yellow">You aren't hungry, then.</font>

836
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,800
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

837
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,960
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak served six months for industrial espionage.</font>

838
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,800
<font color="yellow">He owns and runs a tent bar.</font>

839
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,720
<font color="yellow">Why did you locate them?</font>

840
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,500
<font color="yellow">We need people to help us.</font>

841
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,060
<font color="yellow">Will you scout them?</font>

842
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,500
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon...</font>

843
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,430
<font color="yellow">is very skilled.</font>

844
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,400
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak is a friend I need to help out.</font>

845
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,630
<font color="yellow">- I agree.
-  Once we land,</font>

846
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,430
<font color="yellow">find those two first.</font>

847
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,730
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Dodo Hotel)</font>

849
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,000
<font color="yellow">A Chinese businessman wishes to stay long-term?</font>

850
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,700
<font color="yellow">Yes, Miss.</font>

851
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,530
<font color="yellow">But there's a problem.</font>

852
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,440
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

853
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,800
<font color="yellow">He wants to stay in the suite you're in.</font>

854
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,830
<font color="yellow">My suite?</font>

855
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,120
<font color="yellow">- Tell him to go somewhere else.
-  But in return,</font>

856
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,660
<font color="yellow">he'll rent all the rooms in the floor directly below.</font>

857
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,730
<font color="yellow">- All of them?
-  Yes.</font>

858
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,230
<font color="yellow">Is he bringing a group of old people on a tour?</font>

859
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:46,130
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

860
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:49,330
<font color="yellow">VIPs tend to reserve the whole floor...</font>

861
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,300
<font color="yellow">for security reasons.</font>

862
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,560
<font color="yellow">We must be expecting someone great.</font>

863
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,410
<font color="yellow">If he does show up, I suggest you thank him in person.</font>

864
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:00,760
<font color="yellow">Must I?</font>

865
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,230
<font color="yellow">Someone like him will be very connected.</font>

866
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,930
<font color="yellow">Make his acquaintance.</font>

867
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,390
<font color="yellow">He must be a fat, old man with white hair.</font>

868
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,430
<font color="yellow">I hate that.</font>

869
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,430
<font color="yellow">You do it.</font>

870
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:14,530
<font color="yellow">Miss.</font>

872
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,960
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

873

<font color="yellow">Who's your chairman?</font>

879
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,130
<font color="yellow">Here's his business card.</font>

880
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,760
<font color="yellow">"K"?</font>

881
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,900
<font color="yellow">Is that his name?</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

883
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,560
<font color="yellow">Why does he want to see me?</font>

889
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,400
<font color="yellow">Wake up, Soo Tak.</font>

890
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,130
<font color="yellow">You are awake.</font>

891
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

892
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,430
<font color="yellow">am I possessed? I'm seeing ghosts.</font>

893
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:56,060
<font color="yellow">Someone wants to see you.</font>

894
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,060
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Miss. I still have more years to live.</font>

895
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,060
<font color="yellow">Come to Dodo Hotel's suite by 6pm tomorrow.</font>

896
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,930
<font color="yellow">She just hit me.</font>

897
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,030

901
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:32,880
<font color="yellow">Will you see him?</font>

902
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,160
<font color="yellow">I saw his face even when I was in a coma.</font>

903
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,230
<font color="yellow">I'd love to see him.</font>

904
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,140
<font color="yellow">What's this businessman's name?</font>

905
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,500
<font color="yellow">Everyone calls him "K".</font>

906

<font color="yellow">"K"?</font>

907
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,780
<font color="yellow">Is he in?</font>

908
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,760
<font color="yellow">I just called to confirm.</font>

909
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:10,330
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to invite him to dinner?</font>

910
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, Miss.</font>

911
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000

00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:33,100
<font color="yellow">As a young boy, I grew up on the banks of Cheonggyecheon.</font>

917
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,500
<font color="yellow">I spent my 20s in Mapo looking at the Han River.</font>

918
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,410
<font color="yellow">Now, I work on Namsan and look down at Seoul's city centre.</font>

919
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,730
<font color="yellow">I work for you.</font>

920
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,570
<font color="yellow">I thought and dreamed of a Seoul...</font>

928
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,270
<font color="yellow">If we're to stop him from becoming the mayor,</font>

929
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,360
<font color="yellow">we have to become Dodo Group's legal counsel.</font>

930
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,930
<font color="yellow">How will you stop him?</font>

931
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,760
<font color="yellow">Where do you think all his funds come from?</font>

932
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,630
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's stealing it from Dodo.</font>
