4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,710

<font color="yellow">He trusts Soo Yeon too much.</font>

24
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,650

<font color="yellow">We haven't decided on a price yet, so it's okay.</font>

33

<font color="yellow">Get ready. Let's go eat.</font>

34
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,610
<font color="yellow">That's okay. I'm not hungry.</font>

35
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,250

39

<font color="yellow">Why are you only eating rice?</font>

40
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,450
<font color="yellow">You should try the other dishes. Their food is good.</font>

49

50
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,780

51
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,180
<font color="yellow">I can't do this.</font>

52
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,210
<font color="yellow">I was trying to use you.</font>

53
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,020
<font color="yellow">I already knew that. Why are you bringing it up?</font>

54
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,450
<font color="yellow">I can't do that to you any more.</font>

55
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,180
<font color="yellow">I feel too bad.</font>

56

<font color="yellow">Hae Il told me that Il Jae turned...</font>

57
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,610
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan into a murderer.</font>

58
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,410

59

<font color="yellow">Once this bid is over, I'll give up my position.</font>

60
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,010
<font color="yellow">I can't treat you like this any more.</font>

61
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,650
<font color="yellow">You were never on my side.</font>

62
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,380
<font color="yellow">Not even once.</font>

63
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,250
<font color="yellow">Do you know what's the worst thing you can do to me?</font>

64
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,150
<font color="yellow">It's for you...</font>

65
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,280
<font color="yellow">to leave me.</font>

66
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,780
<font color="yellow">Whether you use me or betray me,</font>

67
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,450
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

68
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,310
<font color="yellow">Just...</font>

69

<font color="yellow">stay by my side.</font>

70
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,280
<font color="yellow">That's all I need, Soo Yeon.</font>

71
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,910
<font color="yellow">Who was the person that used hypnosis to treat me in China?</font>

72
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,850
<font color="yellow">Was his name Professor Jin Hye Ri?</font>

73
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,280
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

74
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,580
<font color="yellow">Contact him and ask him to come to Korea.</font>

75
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,510
<font color="yellow">What do you need him for?</font>

76
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,410
<font color="yellow">I think there is a problem with the treatment he gave me.</font>

77
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,780
<font color="yellow">What problem?</font>

78
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,650
<font color="yellow">I keep seeing someone in my head,</font>

79
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,950
<font color="yellow">but the face disappears within a few seconds.</font>

80
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,480
<font color="yellow">And then I go out of breath and my head starts to hurt.</font>

81
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,250
<font color="yellow">Earlier the better.</font>

82
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,950
<font color="yellow">Check his schedule and send him a flight ticket.</font>

83
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,110
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

84
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,510

85
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,810

86
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,510
<font color="yellow">I'll be there after I get changed.</font>

87
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,880
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

88
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,080
<font color="yellow">She put in a lot of effort in choosing the menu.</font>

89
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,350
<font color="yellow">Please try them.</font>

90
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,450
<font color="yellow">Change this to something else.</font>

91
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,910
<font color="yellow">This one, too.</font>

92
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,850
<font color="yellow">Why? Does it taste bad?</font>

93
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,280
<font color="yellow">You'll like that one for sure.</font>

94
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,850
<font color="yellow">We used premium meat...</font>

95
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,180
<font color="yellow">It's too tough. The sauce isn't good either.</font>

96
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,250
<font color="yellow">Change this one, too.</font>

97
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,050

99
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,450

100
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,480

103

<font color="yellow">Did you check?</font>

104
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,180

<font color="yellow">That's an expensive watch.</font>

114
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,250

118
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,250
<font color="yellow">No wonder it tastes so bad.</font>

119
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,080

120

00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,250
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that then?</font>

129
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,850
<font color="yellow">Because Shin Young...</font>

00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,780
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

159
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,010
<font color="yellow">So did you find anything?</font>

160
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,110
<font color="yellow">There's something common...</font>

161
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,110
<font color="yellow">to people that are titled as heroes.</font>

162
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,750
<font color="yellow">There was always a war involved.</font>

163
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,210
<font color="yellow">They avoided fights they would lose and only fought if they could win.</font>

164
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,110
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

165
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,050
<font color="yellow">what creates a hero...</font>

166
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,950
<font color="yellow">is the public in the end.</font>

167
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,210
<font color="yellow">This election is already a lost game.</font>

168
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,180
<font color="yellow">It's not a fight you can win.</font>

169
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,380
<font color="yellow">I suggest you resign from your candidacy.</font>

170
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,880
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

171
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,510
<font color="yellow">barely started my war.</font>

172
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,210
<font color="yellow">I haven't begun yet.</font>

173
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,310
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

174
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,650
<font color="yellow">only look for battlegrounds.</font>

175
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,710
<font color="yellow">I will only fight the battles that are favourable to me.</font>

176
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,010
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

177
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,810
<font color="yellow">I will move the people's hearts.</font>

178
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

179
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,450
<font color="yellow">the perfect plan...</font>

180
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,780
<font color="yellow">that I have for this election.</font>

181
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,480
<font color="yellow">He'll try to win the hearts of people by finding battlegrounds...</font>

182
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,180
<font color="yellow">and fighting only the battles he'll win.</font>

183
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,650
<font color="yellow">It's very vague and theoretical.</font>

184
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,410
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is a meticulous man. He didn't say it for no reason.</font>

185
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,950
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that he has a definite plan to win?</font>

186
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,980
<font color="yellow">I didn't think much of it at first,</font>

187
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,680
<font color="yellow">but I feel that...</font>

188
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,610
<font color="yellow">there may be something more.</font>

189
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,480
<font color="yellow">Keep your eyes on him. If anything is suspicious,</font>

190
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,610
<font color="yellow">make sure you report it to me.</font>

191
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,650
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

192
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,750
<font color="yellow">Is Gi Tan well?</font>

193
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,010
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

194
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,650
<font color="yellow">I'll be in charge of Il Jae for a while.</font>

195
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,180
<font color="yellow">He'll only be engaged in doing his business.</font>

196
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,210
<font color="yellow">I won't die like this.</font>

197
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,810
<font color="yellow">I can't die like this.</font>

198
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,410
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Chairman!</font>

199
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,210
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

200
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,050
<font color="yellow">You can't suddenly overwork your body.</font>

201
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,810
<font color="yellow">It seems like that's light for you.</font>

202
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,780
<font color="yellow">Give me that one, then.</font>

203
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,750
<font color="yellow">You must eat.</font>

204
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

205
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,310
<font color="yellow">I got hungry after working out too hard.</font>

206
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,310
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

207
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,380
<font color="yellow">Do you like what I've cooked?</font>

208
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,350
<font color="yellow">Taste doesn't matter.</font>

209
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,850
<font color="yellow">I was hungry enough to eat anything.</font>

210
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,450
<font color="yellow">Please eat up.</font>

211
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,550
<font color="yellow">Did you bite on a grit?</font>

212
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,250
<font color="yellow">Did you wash rice thoroughly?</font>

213
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I have bad eyes.</font>

214
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,950
<font color="yellow">Should I get some instant rice?</font>

215
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
<font color="yellow">I never eat instant food.</font>

216
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,680
<font color="yellow">Please give me a minute.</font>

217
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,810
<font color="yellow">I will run out and buy something you like.</font>

218
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,650
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I'm sick of eating out.</font>

219
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,480
<font color="yellow">Everything else was the worst,</font>

220
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,810
<font color="yellow">but my wife was good at cooking.</font>

221
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,710
<font color="yellow">I will try harder.</font>

222
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,950
<font color="yellow">She was my wife, after all.</font>

223
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,510
<font color="yellow">I miss her food.</font>

224
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,480
<font color="yellow">Bok Shin, your cooking improved a lot.</font>

225
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,850
<font color="yellow">Yours is much better than that woman's.</font>

226
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,610
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Chairman.</font>

227
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,580
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

228
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,250
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you have your beloved Mr Gong with you.</font>

229
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,880
<font color="yellow">You know, you should look for someone...</font>

230
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,950
<font color="yellow">whom Gun Woo can marry.</font>

231
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,280
<font color="yellow">Find someone with connections.</font>

232
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,080
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if they are in business or politics.</font>

233
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,410
<font color="yellow">Someone he can marry?</font>

234
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,250
<font color="yellow">No one would be crazy enough to let their daughter marry a love child.</font>

235
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,810
<font color="yellow">If I pass on the company to Gun Woo,</font>

236
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,510
<font color="yellow">they will line up behind him.</font>

237
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,150
<font color="yellow">So don't worry.</font>

238
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,210
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

239
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,650
<font color="yellow">What do you hate so much about Gwang Woo?</font>

240
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,210
<font color="yellow">Don't you know?</font>

241
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,580
<font color="yellow">He's incompetent.</font>

242
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,750
<font color="yellow">You said I was incompetent, but I've been making profits.</font>

243
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,550
<font color="yellow">Competency is nothing.</font>

244
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,610
<font color="yellow">You are unbelievably ignorant.</font>

245
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,910
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

246
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,850
<font color="yellow">You don't hate him because of his competence. It's because of me.</font>

247
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,250
<font color="yellow">You always loved Ja Young more than you loved me.</font>

248
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,850
<font color="yellow">That's why you like Gun Woo more than Gwang Woo.</font>

249
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,380
<font color="yellow">I'm losing my appetite. Go away!</font>

250
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,010
<font color="yellow">Are you giving the company to Gun Woo?</font>

251
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,250
<font color="yellow">Let's settle this on competence, then.</font>

252
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,110
<font color="yellow">We'll be late. Let's go.</font>

253
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,980
<font color="yellow">I hope Gun Woo will get the contract for that ship.</font>

254
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,780
<font color="yellow">I'm worried.</font>

255
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,950
<font color="yellow">I believe in him.</font>

256
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,980
<font color="yellow">He's very competent. He will make it happen.</font>

257
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,750
<font color="yellow">Right. Set up a secret gathering...</font>

258
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,080
<font color="yellow">for major stockholders.</font>

259
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,050
<font color="yellow">I don't think you should do that.</font>

260
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,550
<font color="yellow">It may backfire on you.</font>

261
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,980
<font color="yellow">You should get better.</font>

262
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,380
<font color="yellow">Double my schedule...</font>

263
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,050
<font color="yellow">for rehabilitation exercise.</font>

264
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
<font color="yellow">I will show...</font>

265
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,550
<font color="yellow">the stockholders...</font>

266
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,180
<font color="yellow">that I am...</font>

267
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,210
<font color="yellow">still alive and well.</font>

268
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,280
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

269
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,980
<font color="yellow">I must eat a lot...</font>

270
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,250
<font color="yellow">to work out a lot.</font>

271
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,080
<font color="yellow">Did you hear him?</font>

272
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,320
<font color="yellow">That's what's in his heart.</font>

273
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,650
<font color="yellow">He's just too much.</font>

274
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

275
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,080
<font color="yellow">If Gun Woo gets...</font>

276
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,480
<font color="yellow">this ship contract,</font>

277
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,280
<font color="yellow">he may really end up inheriting the company.</font>

278
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,210
<font color="yellow">You have to get your act straight.</font>

279
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,910
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

280
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,450
<font color="yellow">I found the hotel that K is staying in.</font>

281
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,950
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

282
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,210
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

283
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,580
<font color="yellow">He's at Dodo Hotel's suite room.</font>

284
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,980
<font color="yellow">Dodo Hotel?</font>

285
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,910
<font color="yellow">Why didn't Shin Young tell me?</font>

286
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,320
<font color="yellow">She doesn't know anything.</font>

287
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,650
<font color="yellow">You should meet him right now.</font>

288
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mum.</font>

289
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,510
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I should get him a gift or something?</font>

290
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,710
<font color="yellow">Don't be so cheap. He'll look down on you.</font>

291
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,320
<font color="yellow">Go and be confident.</font>

292
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,380
<font color="yellow">I'm all about confidence.</font>

293
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,210
<font color="yellow">Mr Ahn.</font>

294
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,980
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

295
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,880
<font color="yellow">How pitiful.</font>

296
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,680
<font color="yellow">He was never loved by his father all because of me.</font>

297
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,210
<font color="yellow">I came to meet Chairman K who's staying here.</font>

298
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,250
<font color="yellow">What is this about?</font>

299
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,080
<font color="yellow">This is a long story.</font>

300
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,010
<font color="yellow">This is who I am.</font>

301
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,750
<font color="yellow">Mr Ahn.</font>

302
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,180
<font color="yellow">This is a son of Chairman Do Choong of Dodo Group.</font>

303
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,910
<font color="yellow">He's CEO Do Gwang Woo.</font>

304
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,150
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

305
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,180
<font color="yellow">What I mean is that I have to meet...</font>

306
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,980
<font color="yellow">Chairman K for business.</font>

307
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,650
<font color="yellow">You can't meet him without an appointment.</font>

308
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
<font color="yellow">Please go back.</font>

309
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,580
<font color="yellow">You are one inflexible man. We're all in this business together.</font>

310
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,480
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Sir! - Hello, Sir!</font>

311
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,180
<font color="yellow">What brings CEO Do here?</font>

312
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,010
<font color="yellow">Wait, are you Chairman K, Chief Secretary Moon?</font>

313
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,680
<font color="yellow">I work for him.</font>

314
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,320
<font color="yellow">How can a credit delinquent work for such a man?</font>

315
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,780
<font color="yellow">I became a credit delinquent because of money, not my competence.</font>

316
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,880
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

317
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,050
<font color="yellow">You were one competent worker.</font>

318
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,510
<font color="yellow">Then why did you fire me?</font>

319
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,310
<font color="yellow">It seems like you know me well.</font>

320
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,450
<font color="yellow">Well... That was...</font>

321
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,910
<font color="yellow">Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

322
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,080
<font color="yellow">I'd like to speak a word with you.</font>

323
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,950
<font color="yellow">That little...</font>

324
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,080
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

325
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,480
<font color="yellow">asking me to set up an appointment with Chairman?</font>

326
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,780
<font color="yellow">I will give you enough money for the occasion.</font>

327
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,350
<font color="yellow">Please make this work.</font>

328
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,850
<font color="yellow">No one sees Chairman without an appointment.</font>

329
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,810
<font color="yellow">This is why I am asking you, Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

330
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,810
<font color="yellow">Here's a word for you.</font>

331
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,250
<font color="yellow">Stop reaching for the stars and go on home, idiot.</font>

332
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,250
<font color="yellow">Idiot?</font>

333
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,980
<font color="yellow">As long as I'm around,</font>

334
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,850
<font color="yellow">you will never meet Chairman.</font>

335
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,950
<font color="yellow">No matter how important you think you are,</font>

336
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,450
<font color="yellow">you are just his employee.</font>

337
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,250
<font color="yellow">Chairman K and I are both employers.</font>

338
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,480
<font color="yellow">The nobilities all share the same heart.</font>

339
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,850
<font color="yellow">When I become friends with your chairman,</font>

340
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,680
<font color="yellow">you'll be the first to be laid off.</font>

341
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
<font color="yellow">Look forward to that day.</font>

342
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,310
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

343
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,550
<font color="yellow">you'll be laid off before that happens.</font>

344
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,380
<font color="yellow">I will see to it.</font>

345
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
<font color="yellow">You better...</font>

346
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,210
<font color="yellow">mark my words.</font>

347
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,710
<font color="yellow">Why is that jerk...</font>

348
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,950
<font color="yellow">working with K?</font>

349
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,380
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

350
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,810
<font color="yellow">It's not going to be easy to meet with Chairman K.</font>

351
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,550
<font color="yellow">Anyway, it's about time Gun Woo...</font>

352
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,980
<font color="yellow">decides on the amount for the bid.</font>

353
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,450
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

354
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,250
<font color="yellow">What happened with her?</font>

355
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,310
<font color="yellow">(Chinese Ship Contract)</font>

356
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,510
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

357
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,310
<font color="yellow">Room service.</font>

358
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,750
<font color="yellow">Let's eat first.</font>

359
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,950
<font color="yellow">The bellboy...</font>

360
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,880
<font color="yellow">will be our medium to communicate.</font>

361
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,810
<font color="yellow">Once the bid price is set,</font>

362
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,150
<font color="yellow">let the bellboy know through a written note.</font>

363
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,210
<font color="yellow">They left for a walk. Let's go.</font>

364
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,550
<font color="yellow">This way, Sir.</font>

365
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,780
<font color="yellow">You don't look so happy.</font>

366
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,210
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

367
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,650
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit down.</font>

368
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,650
<font color="yellow">You and Gun Woo were never close.</font>

369
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,180
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's necessarily because of him.</font>

370
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,580
<font color="yellow">Is it Lawyer Oh?</font>

371
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,180
<font color="yellow">Is there a reason...</font>

372
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,150
<font color="yellow">why I'd be upset because of her?</font>

373
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,580
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. I'm asking because you're upset.</font>

374
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,980
<font color="yellow">We have three days left until the bid is over.</font>

375
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,710
<font color="yellow">They say Gun Woo is putting his life on the line for this.</font>

376
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,080
<font color="yellow">He plans on winning the bid to bring Chairman Do back.</font>

377
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,950
<font color="yellow">Both his and Chairman Do's lives are under your thumb.</font>

378
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,510
<font color="yellow">Why don't you show him what you got?</font>

379
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,310
<font color="yellow">I have something else in mind.</font>

380
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,680
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of Dodo Group's shares.</font>

381
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,380
<font color="yellow">Shares? When did you manage that?</font>

382
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,150
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember how Dodo Group...</font>

383
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,950
<font color="yellow">borrowed money from me?</font>

384
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,850
<font color="yellow">Will Il Jae get the money on Thursday?</font>

385
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,480
<font color="yellow">Yes. A huge sum will be deposited...</font>

386
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,150
<font color="yellow">from the defence industry.</font>

387
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,110
<font color="yellow">That means we only have tomorrow to stop Il Jae.</font>

388
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,510
<font color="yellow">I know where we can borrow 20 million dollars.</font>

389
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,110
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to introduce you to them?</font>

390
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,180
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that money was yours?</font>

391
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,610
<font color="yellow">I purchased Dodo Group's shares with that money.</font>

392
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,810
<font color="yellow">They rose quite a bit now.</font>

393
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,150
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

394
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,380
<font color="yellow">what you have in mind is...</font>

395
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,150
<font color="yellow">I plan on...</font>

396
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,910
<font color="yellow">swallowing Dodo Group whole.</font>

397
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,180
<font color="yellow">That will be true revenge.</font>

398
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,410
<font color="yellow">For Il Jae, Gwang Woo and Gun Woo.</font>

399
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,750
<font color="yellow">When you talked about training Shin Young...</font>

400
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,350
<font color="yellow">It's business.</font>

401
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,210
<font color="yellow">It's so that I can take over Dodo Group.</font>

402
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,010
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

403
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,980
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is quiet. He hasn't been doing any campaigns.</font>

404
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,350
<font color="yellow">I sent in an informant to their side.</font>

405
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,680
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry.</font>

406
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,410
<font color="yellow">An informant?</font>

407
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,750
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

408
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,610
<font color="yellow">Here, here and here.</font>

409
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,750
<font color="yellow">These regions are the problematic areas that are...</font>

410
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,410
<font color="yellow">currently under a lot of lawsuits or legal disputes.</font>

411
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,110
<font color="yellow">What's the cause?</font>

412
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,280
<font color="yellow">There are many.</font>

413
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,780
<font color="yellow">There are environmental issues, lease problems,</font>

414
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,110
<font color="yellow">as well as redevelopment.</font>

415
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,410
<font color="yellow">Out of them,</font>

416
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,610
<font color="yellow">schedule the campaign first where there are gangsters involved.</font>

417
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,450
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

418
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,150
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

419
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,980
<font color="yellow">If we play...</font>

420
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,750
<font color="yellow">like the other candidates, I have no chance.</font>

421
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,910
<font color="yellow">I'll make a new public image for myself.</font>

422
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,350
<font color="yellow">I'll become the hero for the less fortunate.</font>

423
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,910
<font color="yellow">- Hello. I'm number three. - Byun Il Jae!</font>

424
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,710
<font color="yellow">- Number three, Byun Il Jae! - Hello, Ma'am.</font>

425
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,950
<font color="yellow">I'm an ordinary candidate standing up for ordinary people.</font>

426
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,580
<font color="yellow">- Number three, Byun Il Jae! - Number three, Byun Il Jae!</font>

427
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,610
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

428
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,150
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

429
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,280
<font color="yellow">I'm an ordinary candidate standing up for ordinary people.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Kill me instead. - What?</font>

434
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,410
<font color="yellow">You punks.</font>

435
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,410
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

436
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,750
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

437
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,680
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

438
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,580
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

439
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,210
<font color="yellow">Help us.</font>

440
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,450
<font color="yellow">We have so much debt. If we're kicked out,</font>

441
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,780
<font color="yellow">we'll starve to death.</font>

442
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,150
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

443
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,650
<font color="yellow">I can only help you if I understand what's going on.</font>

444
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,180
<font color="yellow">Don't butt in and walk away.</font>

445
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,010
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

446
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,480
<font color="yellow">Our company was hired by the landlord to take care of business.</font>

447
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,280
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem?</font>

448
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,380
<font color="yellow">A company?</font>

449
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,010
<font color="yellow">- You guys are gangsters! - You little...</font>

450
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,050
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let her go!</font>

451
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,350
<font color="yellow">- I told you to butt out. - You punk.</font>

452
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
<font color="yellow">Did you just hit me?</font>

453
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,210
<font color="yellow">Should a mayor candidate hit people?</font>

454
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,580
<font color="yellow">"People"?</font>

455
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,380
<font color="yellow">You are nothing but parasites!</font>

456
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,380
<font color="yellow">You suck on the blood of the weak!</font>

457
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,750
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

458
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,580
<font color="yellow">Don't hit them. Just call the police.</font>

459
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,310
<font color="yellow">We'll go by the law.</font>

460
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,580
<font color="yellow">Law?</font>

461
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,110
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk about law?</font>

462
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,880
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's do it by law!</font>

463
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,110
<font color="yellow">Sir, please calm down!</font>

464
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,510
<font color="yellow">- Sir. - Come here.</font>

465
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,410
<font color="yellow">A mayor candidate is beating me up!</font>

466
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,150
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

467
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,010
<font color="yellow">He didn't do anything wrong.</font>

468
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,880
<font color="yellow">He was just trying to help us.</font>

469
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,910
<font color="yellow">Why would you take a just man instead of the gangsters?</font>

470
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,580
<font color="yellow">- He's right. - The police are wrong!</font>

471
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,350
<font color="yellow">- Good luck! - Cheer up!</font>

472
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,380
<font color="yellow">Cheer up!</font>

473
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,310
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and don't lose hope.</font>

474
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,780
<font color="yellow">A just society will come...</font>

475
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,480
<font color="yellow">one day!</font>

476
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,480
<font color="yellow">- Byun Il Jae! - Byun Il Jae!</font>

477
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,310
<font color="yellow">- Byun Il Jae! - Byun Il Jae!</font>

478
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,510
<font color="yellow">- Byun Il Jae! - Byun Il Jae!</font>

479
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,210
<font color="yellow">Is this what Il Jae was talking about?</font>

480
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,750
<font color="yellow">A violent candidate of Seoul mayor...</font>

481
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,050
<font color="yellow">Will this work?</font>

482
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,010
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is quite confident about it.</font>

483
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,110
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

484
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,210
<font color="yellow">No one used such a strategy before.</font>

485
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,410
<font color="yellow">Il Jae took his best shot.</font>

486
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,310
<font color="yellow">Some people are praising him,</font>

487
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,650
<font color="yellow">but most are still criticising.</font>

488
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,450
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he took that into consideration.</font>

489
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,350
<font color="yellow">We don't know when and how things will turn around.</font>

490
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,410
<font color="yellow">Always keep your guard up.</font>

491
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

492
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,880
<font color="yellow">CEO Do has prepared a new menu.</font>

493
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
<font color="yellow">Do you see this?</font>

494
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,280
<font color="yellow">The band-aid by my lips?</font>

495
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,150
<font color="yellow">I splashed hot oil on my face trying...</font>

496
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,080
<font color="yellow">to come up with these recipes.</font>

497
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,350
<font color="yellow">I almost died.</font>

498
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,150
<font color="yellow">No one ever died of an oil splash.</font>

499
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,050
<font color="yellow">Taste these.</font>

500
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,280
<font color="yellow">Does that look mean he likes the food or not?</font>

501
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,680
<font color="yellow">Why should I feel so worried over something like this?</font>

502
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,780
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Is the food any good?</font>

503
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,410
<font color="yellow">Come on. Do you like it or not?</font>

504
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,410
<font color="yellow">It'll do.</font>

505
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,010
<font color="yellow">I was going to kill you...</font>

506
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,220
<font color="yellow">if you didn't like the menu again.</font>

507
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,380
<font color="yellow">- Well done. - Where are you going?</font>

508
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,750
<font color="yellow">We're done.</font>

509
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,280
<font color="yellow">You can't just say, "well done," and leave.</font>

510
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,150
<font color="yellow">Join me in the sky lounge for a drink.</font>

511
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
<font color="yellow">Don't you see this?</font>

512
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,580
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's go.</font>

513
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,050
<font color="yellow">CEO Do, your brother wishes to see you.</font>

514
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,050
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

515
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,250
<font color="yellow">Gosh, did he have to show up now?</font>

516
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,220
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

517
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,280
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

518
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,980
<font color="yellow">He's waiting for you in your office.</font>

519
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,480
<font color="yellow">Let's drink some other time. I hate Gwang Woo's guts.</font>

520
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,310
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

521
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,650
<font color="yellow">Keep quiet.</font>

522
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,510
<font color="yellow">The deal's off the second you tell anyone about me.</font>

523
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,780
<font color="yellow">What rotten timing.</font>

524
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,680
<font color="yellow">This idiot is always a hindrance and never any help.</font>

525
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,050
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep showing up here?</font>

526
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:48,050
<font color="yellow">"Can't I come to see my little sister?" is something I'd never say.</font>

527
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,150
<font color="yellow">Shin Young.</font>

528
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:56,250
<font color="yellow">Do you know the businessman called K who's staying in the suite?</font>

529
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,250
<font color="yellow">Have you met him?</font>

530
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,150
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why?</font>

531
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,550
<font color="yellow">Can you tell me what you know about him?</font>

532
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,150
<font color="yellow">What is he like?</font>

533
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,750
<font color="yellow">I need to know. It's a business thing.</font>

534
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,980
<font color="yellow">How old is he?</font>

535
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,220
<font color="yellow">I think he's a little over 60.</font>

536
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,680
<font color="yellow">So he's on the older side.</font>

537
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,310
<font color="yellow">His business isn't something a young man could handle.</font>

538
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,750
<font color="yellow">He has a receding hairline and a bulging belly.</font>

539
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,450
<font color="yellow">He's about my height, I think.</font>

540
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,180
<font color="yellow">What's his personality like?</font>

541
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,510
<font color="yellow">Nasty.</font>

542
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,310
<font color="yellow">Okay, nasty.</font>

543
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,410
<font color="yellow">Then... Shin Young.</font>

544
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,980
<font color="yellow">Could you...</font>

545
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,880
<font color="yellow">introduce me to that old man?</font>

546
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,580
<font color="yellow">He makes me want to puke.</font>

547
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,780
<font color="yellow">That part is up to you, okay?</font>

548
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,150
<font color="yellow">Wait, Shin Young! Shin Young!</font>

549
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,850
<font color="yellow">That brat never lets me finish.</font>

550
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,720
<font color="yellow">Based on her description,</font>

551
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,750
<font color="yellow">he doesn't seem like a nice guy.</font>

552
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,750
<font color="yellow">K...</font>

553
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,150
<font color="yellow">I hope you're well.</font>

554
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,410
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you up to?</font>

555
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,220
<font color="yellow">I'm campaigning in my own way.</font>

556
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,250
<font color="yellow">Do you know what the media is saying?</font>

557
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,980
<font color="yellow">They say a gangster's running for mayor.</font>

558
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,550
<font color="yellow">Every news outlet is making fun of you and your campaign.</font>

559
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,950
<font color="yellow">Of course they are.</font>

560
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,380
<font color="yellow">Because nothing hurts more than being boring.</font>

561
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,150
<font color="yellow">I bet I just made myself look like a very delectable prey.</font>

562
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,950
<font color="yellow">Did you do that knowing this would happen?</font>

563
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,110
<font color="yellow">The real public opinion...</font>

564
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,250
<font color="yellow">comes from the bottom.</font>

565
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,310
<font color="yellow">Wait and see.</font>

566
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,050
<font color="yellow">The common people will flock towards me.</font>

567
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,680
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

568
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,010
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

569
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,450
<font color="yellow">I don't care if he wins or not.</font>

570
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,450
<font color="yellow">I'm more afraid that...</font>

571
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,220
<font color="yellow">he could harm your future plans.</font>

572
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,650
<font color="yellow">He's already a liability.</font>

573
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,650
<font color="yellow">It all depends on how I clean up the mess.</font>

574
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,450
<font color="yellow">Make him give up.</font>

575
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,050
<font color="yellow">He will be mocked for the rest of his campaign.</font>

576
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,810
<font color="yellow">The mess will be easier to clean up if you start sooner than later.</font>

577
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,850
<font color="yellow">He just won't listen to me.</font>

578
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,050
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

579
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,150
<font color="yellow">Thanks for getting me out.</font>

580
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,150
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much it cost?</font>

581
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,180
<font color="yellow">Gather more money.</font>

582
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,880
<font color="yellow">We'll need to settle many more cases like this.</font>

583
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,220
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

584
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,310
<font color="yellow">If I stop now,</font>

585
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,610
<font color="yellow">I will be remembered as nothing but a gangster.</font>

586
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,510
<font color="yellow">I have to keep going.</font>

587
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,180
<font color="yellow">That way, even if I lose, I can still break even.</font>

588
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,550
<font color="yellow">They have a right to residency!</font>

589
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,850
<font color="yellow">- They have a right! - They have a right!</font>

590
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,750
<font color="yellow">Gangsters hired to evict residents are not welcome here!</font>

591
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,350
<font color="yellow">Be quiet!</font>

592
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,410
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

593
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,350
<font color="yellow">Ladies and gentlemen! Justice will prevail!</font>

594
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,850
<font color="yellow">- Justice will prevail! - Justice will prevail!</font>

595
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,480
<font color="yellow">- Byun Il Jae! - Byun Il Jae!</font>

596
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,280
<font color="yellow">- Byun Il Jae! - Byun Il Jae!</font>

597
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,110
<font color="yellow">- Byun Il Jae! - Byun Il Jae!</font>

598
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,410
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun.</font>

599
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,880
<font color="yellow">This is your third time. Do you have any regrets?</font>

600
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,050
<font color="yellow">I studied law in university,</font>

601
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,220
<font color="yellow">but I value conscience more than law.</font>

602
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,610
<font color="yellow">Our laws are too harsh on the poor and unprivileged.</font>

603
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,650
<font color="yellow">Regrets?</font>

604
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,010
<font color="yellow">I have none.</font>

605
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,610
<font color="yellow">I trust my conscience more than...</font>

606
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,510
<font color="yellow">a biased legal system.</font>

607
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,750
<font color="yellow">What do you have to say about those who want you out of the race?</font>

608
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,510
<font color="yellow">The other candidates are smart and great people.</font>

609
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,480
<font color="yellow">They say all sorts of sweet nothings...</font>

610
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,280
<font color="yellow">to attract votes.</font>

611
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,250
<font color="yellow">Don't you need a candidate like me...</font>

612
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,510
<font color="yellow">who can't accept injustice?</font>

613
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,910
<font color="yellow">A lot more people support you now.</font>

614
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,950
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything to say to them?</font>

615
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,950
<font color="yellow">Seoul has many high-rises, but just as many...</font>

616
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,280
<font color="yellow">dark alleyways.</font>

617
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,980
<font color="yellow">If you want a mayor who will never...</font>

618
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,480
<font color="yellow">compromise with the unjust,</font>

619
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,850
<font color="yellow">then you must vote for me, candidate number three.</font>

620
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,780
<font color="yellow">That's me, Byun Il Jae.</font>

621
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

622
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,220
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - That's all for now.</font>

623
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,220
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

624
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,380
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae's approval rate that had gone down to 11 percent...</font>

625
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,450
<font color="yellow">has risen to 20 percent.</font>

626
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,650
<font color="yellow">But the difference between Hanguk Party's candidate,</font>

627
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,650
<font color="yellow">Lee Jong Cheol, is as much as 20 percent,</font>

628
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,150
<font color="yellow">and analysts say Byun has an uphill battle if he is to win.</font>

629
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,750
<font color="yellow">His approval rate is on the rise, but I doubt you have to worry.</font>

630
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,110
<font color="yellow">It looks like he's going frantic trying to stay in the race.</font>

631
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,650
<font color="yellow">I learned a lot from my past fights against him.</font>

632
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,880
<font color="yellow">He has something up his sleeve.</font>

633
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,680
<font color="yellow">He changed things around in a short while.</font>

634
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,680
<font color="yellow">I'm quite impressed.</font>

635
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,910
<font color="yellow">Don't be.</font>

636
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,450
<font color="yellow">An election is no place to be second best.</font>

637
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,380
<font color="yellow">He'll never get elected at this rate.</font>

638
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,980
<font color="yellow">He needs a big something to make a huge impact.</font>

639
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,280
<font color="yellow">What he's doing now is eye-catching enough.</font>

640
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,450
<font color="yellow">I don't think he can do any more than this.</font>

641
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,950
<font color="yellow">There is one more thing he can do.</font>

642
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,880
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

643
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,880
<font color="yellow">It's a bit risky.</font>

644
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,750
<font color="yellow">If the three parts don't come together,</font>

645
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,110
<font color="yellow">it could blow up in his face.</font>

646
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,010
<font color="yellow">"Three parts"?</font>

648
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,150
<font color="yellow">Why don't you plan it?</font>

649
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,180

650
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,220
<font color="yellow">No one else...</font>

653
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,050

<font color="yellow">The bidding takes place tomorrow.</font>

655
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,480

657
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:52,010
<font color="yellow">Do whatever it takes to find out by tomorrow. Do you understand?</font>

658
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,150
<font color="yellow">Can we not even guess how much Geukdong will bid?</font>

659
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,250
<font color="yellow">They're as secretive as we are.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm a friend of the people and the justice of Seoul.</font>

781
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,480
<font color="yellow">Candidate number three, Byun Il Jae.</font>

782
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:22,410
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo. Ji Soo! Ji Soo!</font>

783
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,410
<font color="yellow">Wake up!</font>

784
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,110
<font color="yellow">Someone call 911! Call an ambulance!</font>

785
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,810
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo! Ji Soo!</font>

786
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,250

00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:42,610
<font color="yellow">How is she?</font>

791
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,980
<font color="yellow">Which hospital is she at?</font>

792
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,180
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

793
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:58,410
<font color="yellow">I have to be here. This is an important occasion.</font>

794
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,510
<font color="yellow">Concentrate more on your drugs.</font>

795
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,910
<font color="yellow">Your stock prices are falling fast.</font>

796
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,650
<font color="yellow">Are you actually showing concern?</font>

797
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,110
<font color="yellow">You won't have to.</font>

798

<font color="yellow">I planned this event. What do you think?</font>

801
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,550
<font color="yellow">Can't you have told me if you knew the auction would be held here?</font>

802
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,580
<font color="yellow">You didn't ask.</font>

803
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,380
<font color="yellow">Have you met this Mr K?</font>

804
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,850
<font color="yellow">Why do you all want to know about him?</font>

805
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:34,750
<font color="yellow">Have you met him?</font>

806
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,250
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

807
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,350
<font color="yellow">Oh, hello. I haven't seen you in a while.</font>

808

<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

809
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,150
<font color="yellow">Who do you think will win the bid?</font>

810
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,510
<font color="yellow">It has to be us.</font>

811
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,080
<font color="yellow">But I think...</font>

812
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,410
<font color="yellow">we have some fierce competition.</font>

813
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,910
<font color="yellow">The shipbuilding industry is struggling.</font>

814
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,750
<font color="yellow">So everyone put their life on the line today.</font>

815
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,810
<font color="yellow">What is Mr Moon doing up there?</font>

816
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,150
<font color="yellow">Don't you know?</font>

817
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:42,510
<font color="yellow">He works for K now.</font>

818
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:45,980
<font color="yellow">He keeps coming back like a weed that never dies.</font>

819
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,050
<font color="yellow">First of all, on behalf of my chairman,</font>

820
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:53,150
<font color="yellow">I would like to thank all the companies taking part.</font>

821
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:57,080
<font color="yellow">Could the representatives please put their proposal...</font>

822
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,950
<font color="yellow">into the box to my right?</font>

823
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,280
<font color="yellow">We will announce the result as soon as we review the bids.</font>

824
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,450
<font color="yellow">We prepared a reception for you.</font>

825
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,310
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy yourselves as you wait.</font>

826
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,610
<font color="yellow">Did you call Professor Jin?</font>

827
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,650
<font color="yellow">The hypnotherapist?</font>

828
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,650
<font color="yellow">He's at a seminar in Europe.</font>

829
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,450
<font color="yellow">He'll come when it's over.</font>

830
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,410
<font color="yellow">I can't help myself.</font>

831
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,450
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

832
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,710

836
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,480
<font color="yellow">How do you think I know?</font>

837
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,350
<font color="yellow">She told me.</font>

838
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,050
<font color="yellow">Are you done?</font>

839
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,010
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

840
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,350
<font color="yellow">How interesting.</font>

841
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,550
<font color="yellow">There's only 10 dollars in it.</font>

842
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,080
<font color="yellow">Tell the winner...</font>

843
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,050
<font color="yellow">to come and see me.</font>

844
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

845
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,350
<font color="yellow">I shall announce the results.</font>

846
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,910
<font color="yellow">The lowest bid...</font>

847
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:23,350
<font color="yellow">was 62 million 277 thousand...</font>

848
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,780
<font color="yellow">and 690 dollars.</font>

849
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,950
<font color="yellow">Dodo Construction won the bid.</font>

850
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:04,150
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

851
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,210
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

852
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:07,710
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell?</font>

853
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,310
<font color="yellow">Geukdong lost...</font>

854
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,910
<font color="yellow">by just 10 dollars.</font>

855
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,980
<font color="yellow">You betrayed me in court.</font>

856
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,650
<font color="yellow">How dare you do it twice!</font>

857
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,180
<font color="yellow">You're the betrayer.</font>

858
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:23,250
<font color="yellow">You tried to ruin Dodo Group's chances.</font>

859
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,180
<font color="yellow">Zoom in on Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

860
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,050
<font color="yellow">That necklace.</font>

861
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,310
<font color="yellow">Why does it look familiar?</font>

862
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,210
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you worked for Chairman K.</font>

863
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,850
<font color="yellow">Remember one thing.</font>

864
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,910
<font color="yellow">Neither of you are allowed to ask personal questions.</font>

865
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,450
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon, Dodo Group isn't a small corner shop.</font>

866
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,810
<font color="yellow">However large your company is,</font>

867
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:38,310
<font color="yellow">you now work for us.</font>

868
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,650
<font color="yellow">Will you really not tell me who gave the tip?</font>

869
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,210
<font color="yellow">He hates being at the centre of attention.</font>
