<font color="yellow">Then the man...</font>

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,820
<font color="yellow">lost his memory.</font>

150

151
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,330

<font color="yellow">Il Jae is helping Gun Woo?</font>

158
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,530
<font color="yellow">I believe it's quite possible...</font>

159
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,890
<font color="yellow">also since Hwang Jae Man helped us.</font>

160
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,030
<font color="yellow">Why don't we contact Yeom Hyeong Gu?</font>

161
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,630
<font color="yellow">It might be faster that way.</font>

162
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,330
<font color="yellow">- Go and meet with him.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

163
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,690
<font color="yellow">I saw Gi Tan on my way in.</font>

164
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,530
<font color="yellow">It was funny to see them all confused.</font>

165
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,060
<font color="yellow">It's the termination agreement on our joint account.</font>

166
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,090
<font color="yellow">(Joint Account Termination Consent)</font>

167
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,790
<font color="yellow">I'll stamp on it on the day the bonds expire in six months.</font>

168
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,360
<font color="yellow">If you fail to help me then,</font>

169
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,390
<font color="yellow">I will not sign this agreement.</font>

170
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,360
<font color="yellow">That won't happen, so don't worry.</font>

171
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,830
<font color="yellow">Also, don't come to the office to see me any more.</font>

172
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,660
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you where to meet.</font>

173
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,360
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Soo Yeon?</font>

174
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,160
<font color="yellow">Remember this.</font>

175
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,660
<font color="yellow">The moment she finds about us, we will no longer work together.</font>

176
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,930
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

177
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,260
<font color="yellow">Your life will end up being ruined because of Soo Yeon.</font>

178
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,360
<font color="yellow">Come on in.</font>

179
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,930
<font color="yellow">You were secretly waiting for us, right?</font>

180
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,790
<font color="yellow">Sit down, sit down.</font>

181
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,990
<font color="yellow">Have some gimbap.</font>

182
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,460
<font color="yellow">You can't get me to talk even if you do this.</font>

183
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,940
<font color="yellow">Don't bother wasting your time.</font>

184
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,130
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo used to love gimbap.</font>

185
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,090
<font color="yellow">If I was making some, he'd be so busy...</font>

186
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,860
<font color="yellow">stealing pieces beside me.</font>

187
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,430
<font color="yellow">I hate gimbap, so you two can eat it.</font>

188
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,660
<font color="yellow">That's weird. Your mother said...</font>

189
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,360
<font color="yellow">that you like it.</font>

190
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,460
<font color="yellow">My mother?</font>

191
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,060
<font color="yellow">These are from your mother back home.</font>

192
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,790
<font color="yellow">She told me you hate spinach and added burdock instead.</font>

193
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,140
<font color="yellow">You met my mother?</font>

194
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,360
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

195
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,900
<font color="yellow">I didn't mention that you kidnapped and murdered people.</font>

196
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,230
<font color="yellow">That would be a bad idea. She looked quite old.</font>

197
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,490
<font color="yellow">She's old, but she worked so hard...</font>

198
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,190
<font color="yellow">to make this gimbap for her son.</font>

199
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,890
<font color="yellow">Her hands are wrinkly but still strong.</font>

200
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,180
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

201
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,990
<font color="yellow">You know very well why.</font>

202
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,830
<font color="yellow">I didn't kill Dong Soo!</font>

203
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,560
<font color="yellow">I know. It was Il Jae.</font>

204
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,130
<font color="yellow">Just tell me where the autopsy result is.</font>

205
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,530
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I don't know! I said, I don't know!</font>

206
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,290
<font color="yellow">You'll remember it soon...</font>

207
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,960
<font color="yellow">because I'll keep coming back until you do.</font>

208
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,330
<font color="yellow">Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

209
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,230
<font color="yellow">Your mother still believes that you're a good son.</font>

210
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,590
<font color="yellow">When I told her that you ended up here because of someone evil,</font>

211
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,790
<font color="yellow">she grabbed my hands and cried.</font>

212
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,460
<font color="yellow">She had to send her only son to prison.</font>

213
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,060
<font color="yellow">How do you think she'd feel?</font>

214
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,730
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

215
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,690
<font color="yellow">it's worse for Lawyer Oh.</font>

216
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,490
<font color="yellow">She had to say goodbye to her brother...</font>

217
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,230
<font color="yellow">whom she raised like her son.</font>

218
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,170
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Mr Min.</font>

219
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,190
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

220
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,460
<font color="yellow">This is all because of that awful man, Il Jae.</font>

221
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,290
<font color="yellow">He'll be beaten to death again even after he dies.</font>

222
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,030
<font color="yellow">Right, there is soda in that plastic...</font>

223
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,390
<font color="yellow">Wait, are you crying?</font>

224
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,890
<font color="yellow">Think about your mother.</font>

225
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,790
<font color="yellow">Eat them all.</font>

226
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,060
<font color="yellow">And eat slowly.</font>

227
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,760
<font color="yellow">You're going through so much because of Il Jae.</font>

228
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,560
<font color="yellow">I saw him crying as he ate gimbap.</font>

229
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,790
<font color="yellow">I think there has been a slight change.</font>

230
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,780
<font color="yellow">He still won't talk easily.</font>

231
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,890
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

232
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,510
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is like religion to him.</font>

233
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,430
<font color="yellow">Can you check and see what Il Jae is up to?</font>

234
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,170
<font color="yellow">I heard he got divorced and opened up a lawyer's office.</font>

235
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,590
<font color="yellow">I think he's staying low.</font>

236
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,090
<font color="yellow">We can't wait around for Choong Dong to come through.</font>

237
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,730
<font color="yellow">We'll go and shake Il Jae, too.</font>

238
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,890
<font color="yellow">Il Jae opened up a lawyer's office.</font>

239
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,960
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo took over the company...</font>

240
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,460
<font color="yellow">and Mr Hwang is no longer on his side.</font>

241
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,830
<font color="yellow">He has nothing else to do.</font>

242
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,460
<font color="yellow">It looked like he is meeting Ji Soo.</font>

243
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,290
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

244
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,460
<font color="yellow">Why did you meet Il Jae?</font>

245
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,760
<font color="yellow">Have you been following me?</font>

246
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,290
<font color="yellow">You do meet him then. I thought I'd throw it out there.</font>

247
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,170
<font color="yellow">I'm not afraid of enemies that are on the move.</font>

248
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,130
<font color="yellow">An unseen enemy is a bigger problem.</font>

249
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,990
<font color="yellow">Is Il Jae...</font>

250
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,830
<font color="yellow">having meetings with Gun Woo?</font>

251
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,990
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

252
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,160
<font color="yellow">I think you would at least know where he hid the money...</font>

253
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,030
<font color="yellow">from that paper company.</font>

254
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,990
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

255
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,060
<font color="yellow">You must have mistook me.</font>

256
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,990
<font color="yellow">I never said that I'd help you.</font>

257
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,690
<font color="yellow">But you will.</font>

258
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,030
<font color="yellow">You'll work like a cow for Mr Hwang,</font>

259
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,660
<font color="yellow">but you will...</font>

260
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
<font color="yellow">end up getting eaten by Il Jae.</font>

261
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,530
<font color="yellow">Are you cursing me?</font>

262
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,160
<font color="yellow">I'm not. It's the reality.</font>

263
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,790
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows this is the reality.</font>

264
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,980
<font color="yellow">The problem is that you don't see it.</font>

265
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,490
<font color="yellow">I hate Il Jae.</font>

266
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,590
<font color="yellow">But I do not trust you.</font>

267
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,160
<font color="yellow">Do not ever try to persuade me again.</font>

268
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,160
<font color="yellow">We're always open.</font>

269
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,760
<font color="yellow">You're welcome to come whenever you change your mind.</font>

270
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,360
<font color="yellow">We'll be waiting.</font>

271
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,790
<font color="yellow">Is there any chance Hyeong Gu will give in to us?</font>

272
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,760
<font color="yellow">He won't budge unless Jae Man loses the presidential election.</font>

273
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,960
<font color="yellow">Find someone trustworthy.</font>

274
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,160
<font color="yellow">And let them track Jae Man, Il Jae, Hyeong Gu and Ji Soo.</font>

275
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,180
<font color="yellow">Are you going to put a tail on all of them?</font>

276
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,660
<font color="yellow">Things will begin to unfold very rapidly from now on.</font>

277
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,360
<font color="yellow">We have to be more aggressive.</font>

278
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,730
<font color="yellow">Now, I have to do the laundry with my own hands.</font>

279
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,190
<font color="yellow">How did the chairwoman of Dodo Group get this low?</font>

280
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,190
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja, did you take all of the laundry on the hanger?</font>

281
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,690
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

282
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,990
<font color="yellow">You have to look closely. You're mixing them up.</font>

283
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,150
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

284
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,260
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I just folded those.</font>

285
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,040
<font color="yellow">Please ask me first before you do any chores.</font>

286
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,990
<font color="yellow">You might kick me out if I rip any of your clothes.</font>

287
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,260
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm asking you to not touch anything without asking.</font>

288
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,790
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

289
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,360
<font color="yellow">Hey, those...</font>

290
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,630
<font color="yellow">do not look like my brother's.</font>

291
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,360
<font color="yellow">Are those Il Jae's?</font>

292
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,770
<font color="yellow">Why do you care?</font>

293
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,330
<font color="yellow">You're such a foolish girl.</font>

294
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,890
<font color="yellow">How can you do the laundry for your ex-husband?</font>

295
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,890
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

296
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,330
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

297
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,760
<font color="yellow">Mum. Mum. Mum, this is bad.</font>

298
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,350
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

299
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,550
<font color="yellow">The court called me today.</font>

300
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,870
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is filing to become Father's legal guardian.</font>

301
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,040
<font color="yellow">Legal guardian? Why?</font>

302
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,430
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask? Because he's diagnosed as incompetent.</font>

303
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,940
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Gwang Woo.</font>

304
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,880
<font color="yellow">How can I not worry?</font>

305
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,760
<font color="yellow">Only immediate family members are allowed to do that.</font>

306
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,290
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo...</font>

307
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,490
<font color="yellow">isn't your father's son on paper.</font>

308
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,160
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

311
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,790
<font color="yellow">He couldn't.</font>

312
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,660
<font color="yellow">Without my consent,</font>

313
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,080
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo can't be added to the family register.</font>

314
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,530

315
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,760
<font color="yellow">to inherit his assets?</font>

316
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,830
<font color="yellow">For now, it's just Shin Young.</font>

317
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,990
<font color="yellow">We can legally eliminate...</font>

318
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,230
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja and Gwang Woo from inheriting his assets.</font>

319
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,450
<font color="yellow">Once he gets a divorce,</font>

320
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,780
<font color="yellow">I can be added to the family register, right?</font>

321
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,990
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

322
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,790
<font color="yellow">I thought Chairman Do Choong doesn't have a long time.</font>

323
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,720
<font color="yellow">I doubt Gwi Ja will agree to divorce him.</font>

324
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,160
<font color="yellow">It'll take at least six months if they get into a lawsuit.</font>

325
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,760
<font color="yellow">Can't you make him rewrite his will?</font>

326
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,630
<font color="yellow">A will written by someone who has dementia...</font>

327
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,390
<font color="yellow">has no legal force.</font>

328
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,830

333
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,130
<font color="yellow">The problem is its contents.</font>

334
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,790

337
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,060

338
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,730
<font color="yellow">Therefore, I will not give a penny to them.</font>

340
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,600
<font color="yellow">neglected me most of the time.</font>

341
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,860
<font color="yellow">Hence, I'll only give her the house in Samseong-dong.</font>

342
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,960
<font color="yellow">My company and shares...</font>

343
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,180
<font color="yellow">will be inherited to my second son.</font>

344
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,960
<font color="yellow">However, my second son...</font>

345
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,130
<font color="yellow">will need to grow the company in abundance after my wish.</font>

346
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,530
<font color="yellow">For a will to have legal force,</font>

347
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,710

348
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,530

350
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,560

368
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,530
<font color="yellow">that he has dementia?</font>

369
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,390

<font color="yellow">But, Sir...</font>

462
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,360
<font color="yellow">Il Jae.</font>

463
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,260
<font color="yellow">Tell me your strategy.</font>

464
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,360
<font color="yellow">You'll draw in votes if you put yourself down.</font>

465
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,090
<font color="yellow">During the national campaign tour,</font>

466
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,860
<font color="yellow">try to show yourself as the everyday Joe.</font>

467
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,830
<font color="yellow">You should then meet with the shadow cabinet that were forgotten.</font>

468
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,030
<font color="yellow">After that...</font>

469
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,030
<font color="yellow">You'll end up helping us.</font>

470
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,160
<font color="yellow">You work so hard for Congressman Hwang,</font>

471
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,460
<font color="yellow">but Il Jae will eat you alive.</font>

472
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,260
<font color="yellow">He came here alone after meeting with Jae Man.</font>

473
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,590
<font color="yellow">It's obvious there were disagreements during the meeting.</font>

474
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,790
<font color="yellow">You better leave.</font>

475
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,260
<font color="yellow">I won't betray Congressman Hwang.</font>

476
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,690
<font color="yellow">We didn't say anything about betraying him.</font>

477
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,090
<font color="yellow">I only mentioned that you should get rid of Il Jae.</font>

478
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,460
<font color="yellow">Just tell us where Il Jae's secret funds are going...</font>

479
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,830
<font color="yellow">and give us the proof that he evaded taxes.</font>

480
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,190
<font color="yellow">Then what about the election funds?</font>

481
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,590
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it, of course.</font>

482
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,660
<font color="yellow">The thirsty will look for the well first.</font>

483
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,330
<font color="yellow">When they're in a financial problem after we get rid of Il Jae,</font>

484
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,030
<font color="yellow">I'll decline Jae Man's request at first.</font>

485
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,360
<font color="yellow">Then we'll act like you persuaded me.</font>

486
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,530
<font color="yellow">That means you'll become the key figure to have made...</font>

487
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,860
<font color="yellow">this campaign successful.</font>

488
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,530
<font color="yellow">If Congressman Hwang becomes the president,</font>

489
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,660
<font color="yellow">you'd become...</font>

490
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,560
<font color="yellow">his right hand.</font>

491
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,290
<font color="yellow">Of course, that's if Il Jae is gone.</font>

492
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,490
<font color="yellow">By then,</font>

493
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,800
<font color="yellow">Il Jae will be remarried to Ji Soo.</font>

494
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,160
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that.</font>

495
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,030
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure that doesn't happen.</font>

496
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,660
<font color="yellow">You should tell him the details later.</font>

497
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,760
<font color="yellow">Let me repeat.</font>

498
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,190
<font color="yellow">My target is Il Jae, not Congressman Hwang.</font>

499
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,690
<font color="yellow">I'll look into...</font>

500
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,730
<font color="yellow">the documents you need.</font>

501
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,860
<font color="yellow">Did you wake up?</font>

502
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,100
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong!</font>

503
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,260
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

504
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,890
<font color="yellow">My legs...</font>

505
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,830
<font color="yellow">I can't move them!</font>

506
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,930
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

507
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,090
<font color="yellow">Maybe you walked for too long earlier.</font>

508
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,360
<font color="yellow">Are you sure I'm getting better?</font>

509
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,120
<font color="yellow">Dr Hwang says so. That's what we have to believe.</font>

510
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,490
<font color="yellow">My paralysis is getting worse.</font>

511
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,490
<font color="yellow">Could Dr Hwang...</font>

512
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,030
<font color="yellow">be tricked by Gwi Ja?</font>

513
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,260
<font color="yellow">I'll look into it.</font>

514
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,290
<font color="yellow">No, don't bother.</font>

515
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,690
<font color="yellow">Ask them for my medical records.</font>

516
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,190
<font color="yellow">I better get checked...</font>

517
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,000
<font color="yellow">by another doctor.</font>

518
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,460
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

519
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,430
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

520
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,730
<font color="yellow">Why can't you show us the medical records?</font>

521
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,390
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

522
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,230
<font color="yellow">I told him not to reveal it.</font>

523
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,950
<font color="yellow">Could you give us a moment?</font>

524
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,990
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

525
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,790
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong, listen to me carefully.</font>

526
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,790
<font color="yellow">Father is terminally ill.</font>

527
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,630
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

528
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,430
<font color="yellow">He's terminally ill?</font>

529
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,520
<font color="yellow">He has less than six months.</font>

530
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,460
<font color="yellow">It's best not to tell him.</font>

531
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,160
<font color="yellow">Is there no hope?</font>

532
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,160
<font color="yellow">Can't he have surgery?</font>

533
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,530
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

534
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,830
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me before?</font>

535
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,190
<font color="yellow">I couldn't tell you because the results weren't out.</font>

536
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,690
<font color="yellow">We better tell his family.</font>

537
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,660
<font color="yellow">- We can't do that.
-  What do you mean?</font>

538
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,160
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let him die alone like that?</font>

539
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,330
<font color="yellow">Don't you know why he ended up like that?</font>

540
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,890
<font color="yellow">Those people are not his family.</font>

541
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,990
<font color="yellow">I won't forgive them.</font>

542
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,110
<font color="yellow">We should at least tell Shin Young.</font>

543
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,730
<font color="yellow">I'll tell her myself.</font>

544
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,360
<font color="yellow">Please focus on making Father as comfortable as he can be.</font>

545
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,860
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

546
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,190
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do has disappeared again.</font>

547
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,230
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? What do you mean he disappeared?</font>

548
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. He was gone when I came back from the washroom.</font>

549
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,190
<font color="yellow">If he got changed, maybe he went to Congressman Hwang's again.</font>

550
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,430
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
-  Have you checked the CCTV?</font>

551
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,230
<font color="yellow">He was picking flowers in the garden an hour ago.</font>

552
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,290
<font color="yellow">Flowers?</font>

553
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,960
<font color="yellow">That must be it.</font>

554
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,690
<font color="yellow">He went to find his wife.</font>

555
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,290
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

556
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,160
<font color="yellow">These are for you.</font>

557
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,310
<font color="yellow">Take the flowers...</font>

558
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,660
<font color="yellow">before his arms fall off.</font>

559
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,330
<font color="yellow">You're so generous.</font>

560
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,360
<font color="yellow">Jae Man.</font>

561
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
<font color="yellow">Give me...</font>

562
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,630
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja's hand.</font>

563
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,630
<font color="yellow">I want...</font>

564
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,260
<font color="yellow">to marry her.</font>

565
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,330
<font color="yellow">Oh dear...</font>

566
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,890
<font color="yellow">I know...</font>

567
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,460
<font color="yellow">you don't like me.</font>

568
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,630
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

569
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,090
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I can...</font>

570
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,630
<font color="yellow">make her happy.</font>

571
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,030
<font color="yellow">How will you make her happy?</font>

572
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,960
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

573
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,260
<font color="yellow">I am penniless.</font>

574
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,530
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

575
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,590
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure...</font>

576
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,330
<font color="yellow">you can live a luxurious life.</font>

577
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,360
<font color="yellow">Was this what he was like?</font>

578
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,990
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

579
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,290
<font color="yellow">But who cares?</font>

580
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,630
<font color="yellow">We're practically enemies now.</font>

581
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,090
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

582
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,430
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

583
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,230
<font color="yellow">I'd like a chicken...</font>

584
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,330
<font color="yellow">your mother cooked for me.</font>

585
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,690
<font color="yellow">Tell Shin Young to come right over.</font>

586
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,390
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

587
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,660
<font color="yellow">I need her permission to look after your dad.</font>

588
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,730
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

589
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,510
<font color="yellow">He came over...</font>

590
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,460
<font color="yellow">with the flowers to propose to Mum.</font>

591
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,260
<font color="yellow">Dad, come with me.</font>

592
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,860
<font color="yellow">I'll look after you.</font>

593
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,730
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

594
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,500
<font color="yellow">I'm Shin Young, your daughter.</font>

595
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,530
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

596
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,990
<font color="yellow">I'll marry Gwi Ja and live here.</font>

597
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,560
<font color="yellow">He's gotten worse.</font>

598
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,760
<font color="yellow">I think it's best for him...</font>

599
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,430
<font color="yellow">if we look after him.</font>

600
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,430
<font color="yellow">Be good to him.</font>

601
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,760
<font color="yellow">If he makes one complaint,</font>

602
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,830
<font color="yellow">I'll come for him.</font>

603
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,930
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving already?</font>

604
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,530
<font color="yellow">Don't just sit there. Get up.</font>

605
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,530
<font color="yellow">What? Right.</font>

606
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,060
<font color="yellow">They're likely to inherit his assets if he stays here.</font>

607
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,160
<font color="yellow">He's practically a blessing to them.</font>

608
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,660
<font color="yellow">Have some, Mr Hwang.</font>

609
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,730
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. The chicken's all yours.</font>

610
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,030
<font color="yellow">He thinks you're his father-in-law.</font>

611
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,530
<font color="yellow">I think his memory...</font>

612
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,490
<font color="yellow">is going back in time.</font>

613
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,530
<font color="yellow">He might end up...</font>

614
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,960
<font color="yellow">asking for a bottle of milk.</font>

615
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,690
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about him and focus on work.</font>

616
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,960
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

617
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,770

776
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,820
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

777
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,790
<font color="yellow">I need you to get me those files.</font>

778
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,690
<font color="yellow">Why do you need them?</font>

779
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,090
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan set a trap and I walked into it.</font>

780
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,930

<font color="yellow">He will.</font>

784
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,790
<font color="yellow">I will make it happen.</font>

785
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,030
<font color="yellow">So you want to use those files later on...</font>

786
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,930
<font color="yellow">to blackmail the president.</font>

787
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,790
<font color="yellow">That wasn't my plan,</font>

788
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,260
<font color="yellow">but the circumstances have changed.</font>

789
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,590
<font color="yellow">I think this is a dangerous gamble.</font>

790
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,530
<font color="yellow">That's why it's called a gamble.</font>

791
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,260
<font color="yellow">You either succeed or fail.</font>

797
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,390
<font color="yellow">It's that I underestimated you.</font>

798
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,260
<font color="yellow">You'll be able to come up with a reason to gain access.</font>

799
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,230
<font color="yellow">You have to get those files.</font>

800

801

<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

804
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,190
<font color="yellow">Why did you call?</font>

805
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,060
<font color="yellow">Have you heard about the chairman?</font>

806
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,290
<font color="yellow">I heard he's staying at Mr Hwang's.</font>

807
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,990

808
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,030
<font color="yellow">But the doctor won't let me.</font>

809
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,730
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,790
<font color="yellow">It's zero percent.</font>

932
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,390
<font color="yellow">If any doctor had given me a 10-percent success rate,</font>

933
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,590
<font color="yellow">I'd have done it if only to get back...</font>

934
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,090
<font color="yellow">the memories I lost.</font>

935
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,460
<font color="yellow">This morning,</font>

936
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,390
<font color="yellow">I spoke with Doctor Campbell.</font>

937
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:57,730
<font color="yellow">The success rate isn't 10 percent.</font>

938
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,160
<font color="yellow">It's over 30 percent.</font>

939
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,330
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

940
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,390
<font color="yellow">I'm against it.</font>

941
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:12,890
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

942
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,460
<font color="yellow">The 30-percent success rate means...</font>

943
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,580
<font color="yellow">there's a 70-percent chance it will fail.</font>

944
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,590
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

945
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,930
<font color="yellow">do you want to let him die?</font>

946
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,890
<font color="yellow">It's not my place to say, but...</font>

947
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,160
<font color="yellow">since you're all here,</font>

948
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,390
<font color="yellow">put it to a vote.</font>

949
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,460
<font color="yellow">Whoever is against the surgery,</font>

950
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:38,160
<font color="yellow">raise your hand.</font>

951
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,430
<font color="yellow">Other than Shin Young,</font>

952
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,330
<font color="yellow">everyone objects.</font>

953
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,430
<font color="yellow">The surgery...</font>

954
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,560
<font color="yellow">will not happen.</font>

955
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:02,290
<font color="yellow">I'm his custodian.</font>

956
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,730
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

957
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:07,060
<font color="yellow">The others don't have a legal say, do they?</font>

958
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:10,430
<font color="yellow">No. They don't.</font>

959
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,450
<font color="yellow">I don't care what you say.</font>

960
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:13,460
<font color="yellow">I called you here...</font>

961
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,050
<font color="yellow">to tell you that he's getting the surgery.</font>

962
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,430
<font color="yellow">When did you start caring about him?</font>

963
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,990
<font color="yellow">He said he'd give you half of his assets.</font>

964
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,460
<font color="yellow">That's what this is about!</font>

965
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:25,330
<font color="yellow">Are you going to kill Dad to take his money?</font>

966
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you against the surgery?</font>

967
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,450
<font color="yellow">You're afraid he'll recover and you'll end up without a penny!</font>

968
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,350
<font color="yellow">Learn to give up when everyone says no.</font>

969
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,220
<font color="yellow">What are you even doing here?</font>

970
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,260
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

971
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:40,960
<font color="yellow">Don't you know my dad's the reason your family's so rich?</font>

972
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,560
<font color="yellow">We own shares.</font>

973
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:44,490
<font color="yellow">Stop it, all of you.</font>

974
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,950
<font color="yellow">What would Soo Yeon think of us?</font>

975
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,730
<font color="yellow">Don't act like you're so blameless.</font>

976
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:53,460
<font color="yellow">You told us Dad was terminally ill because you were up to something!</font>

977
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,090
<font color="yellow">I've had enough. Shut your mouth.</font>

978
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,790
<font color="yellow">This is how I talk! It can't be helped!</font>

979
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:00,190
<font color="yellow">May you all...</font>

980
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,890
<font color="yellow">be struck by lightning!</font>

981
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,430
<font color="yellow">(Monster)</font>

982
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,730
<font color="yellow">Do Choong's secret safe?</font>

983
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:38,090
<font color="yellow">I might be able to find proof that Il Jae killed your parents.</font>

984
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,460
<font color="yellow">Don't visit me any more.</font>

985
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,390
<font color="yellow">Are you going to betray me, too?</font>

986
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,350
<font color="yellow">Look after Shin Young for me.</font>

987
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:45,860
<font color="yellow">He died at 9:28am.</font>

988
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,190
<font color="yellow">If the surgery's a success, it puts a dent in my plan.</font>

989
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,460
<font color="yellow">He's already dead.</font>

990
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,290
<font color="yellow">This dirty fight will end.</font>

991
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,690
<font color="yellow">I won't die until I get what I want.</font>
