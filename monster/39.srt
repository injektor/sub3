<font color="yellow">Why is this photo here?</font>

3
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,990
<font color="yellow">Was Soo Yeon...</font>

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,950
<font color="yellow">an employee here?</font>

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,650
<font color="yellow">Were Soo Yeon...</font>

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,450
<font color="yellow">and I this close?</font>

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,260
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,320
<font color="yellow">Kang Gi Tan.</font>

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,120
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Soo Yeon.</font>

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,850
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,650
<font color="yellow">forget about her.</font>

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,290
<font color="yellow">I just got out of the meeting.</font>

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,290
<font color="yellow">I'll come by the office.</font>

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,590
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mr Min.</font>

16
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,090
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,250
<font color="yellow">Chairman wants to see you.</font>

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,660
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,930
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

20
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,620
<font color="yellow">I heard you patented the MK2 vaccine.</font>

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,850
<font color="yellow">- What about it?
-  I'd like...</font>

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,490
<font color="yellow">to buy the patent.</font>

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,890
<font color="yellow">You were right.</font>

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,490
<font color="yellow">Why are you here, Soo Yeon?</font>

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,520
<font color="yellow">I called her.</font>

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,190
<font color="yellow">Join us, Lawyer Oh.</font>

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,590
<font color="yellow">If you don't need me here...</font>

28
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,050
<font color="yellow">We're talking business.</font>

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,820
<font color="yellow">We'd feel comfortable...</font>

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,850
<font color="yellow">with a legal representative.</font>

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,890
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Have a seat.</font>

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,290
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh, let me ask you something.</font>

33
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,650
<font color="yellow">It's about B World, Il Jae's old company.</font>

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,020
<font color="yellow">Did you know Gun Woo purchased it?</font>

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,690
<font color="yellow">You didn't.</font>

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,620
<font color="yellow">How did you take over?</font>

37
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,920
<font color="yellow">Is it wrong to acquire a company?</font>

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,490
<font color="yellow">It's not.</font>

39
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,720
<font color="yellow">I find it odd that Il Jae sold his goose...</font>

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,690
<font color="yellow">that lays golden eggs to you.</font>

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,220
<font color="yellow">Don't you, Lawyer Oh?</font>

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,620
<font color="yellow">This is what I think.</font>

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,580
<font color="yellow">Either he and Il Jae had some sort of a deal,</font>

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,390
<font color="yellow">or Il Jae was threatened by him...</font>

45
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,220
<font color="yellow">and had no choice...</font>

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,190
<font color="yellow">but to hand over the company.</font>

47
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,590
<font color="yellow">The B World information you gave Lawyer Oh before the trial...</font>

48
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,950
<font color="yellow">If I'm right, those files were meaningless.</font>

49
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,690
<font color="yellow">I think you kept the real deal...</font>

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,750
<font color="yellow">and used it to threaten Il Jae.</font>

51
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,400
<font color="yellow">Your novel's quite appealing.</font>

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,490
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

53
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,510
<font color="yellow">in exchange for B World,</font>

54
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,950
<font color="yellow">I gave up the home shopping channel and golf course.</font>

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,820
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a reasonable deal?</font>

56
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,220
<font color="yellow">It was a foolish one.</font>

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,650
<font color="yellow">Once the MK2 vaccine's released,</font>

58
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,340
<font color="yellow">B World will go down.</font>

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,180
<font color="yellow">That's why I made an offer.</font>

60
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,080
<font color="yellow">I want to buy the patent...</font>

61
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,290
<font color="yellow">for the MK2 vaccine.</font>

62
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
<font color="yellow">You know that...</font>

63
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,590
<font color="yellow">I won't sell it.</font>

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,650
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

65
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,450
<font color="yellow">If B World goes down, Dodo Pharmaceutical...</font>

66
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
<font color="yellow">will take a hit.</font>

67
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,050
<font color="yellow">Attacking the holding company...</font>

68
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,450
<font color="yellow">means you want to start a war against Dodo Group.</font>

69
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,090
<font color="yellow">I'm running a legitimate business.</font>

70
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,520
<font color="yellow">The threat to Dodo Pharmaceutical...</font>

71
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,150
<font color="yellow">is the result of your foolish transactions.</font>

72
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,650
<font color="yellow">We're done talking.</font>

73
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,660
<font color="yellow">I tried to give you a way out.</font>

74
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,590
<font color="yellow">An obedient donkey gets a carrot.</font>

75
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,800
<font color="yellow">But an insolent one...</font>

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,990
<font color="yellow">gets a whipping.</font>

77
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,190
<font color="yellow">I hold the rein...</font>

78
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,790
<font color="yellow">and you're my donkey.</font>

79
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,790
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me you'd taken over B World?</font>

80
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,510
<font color="yellow">As your legal counsel, I had to know.</font>

81
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,820
<font color="yellow">You know I was busy with the general meeting.</font>

82
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,720
<font color="yellow">You could have told me after the general meeting.</font>

83
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,690
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me you believe all that nonsense.</font>

84
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,360
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for evidence of Il Jae's corruption.</font>

85
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,050
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I paid so much for his company?</font>

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,680
<font color="yellow">Embezzlement, tax fraud, illegal lobbying.</font>

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,550
<font color="yellow">If I find proof of these,</font>

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,360
<font color="yellow">I can lock him up for good at his upcoming appeal.</font>

89
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,550
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the files as soon as I find them.</font>

90
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,620
<font color="yellow">So don't believe the script Gi Tan wrote.</font>

91
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,190
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak.</font>

92
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,990
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

93
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,220
<font color="yellow">We're listening.</font>

94
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,920
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh and I...</font>

95
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,190
<font color="yellow">How close were we?</font>

96
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,990
<font color="yellow">The photo we saw...</font>

97
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,990
<font color="yellow">shows that we weren't always this polite.</font>

98
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,550
<font color="yellow">What happened between...</font>

99
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,520
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh and me?</font>

100
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,450
<font color="yellow">You two were very close.</font>

101
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,920
<font color="yellow">"Very close"?</font>

102
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,220
<font color="yellow">How close do you mean?</font>

103
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,690
<font color="yellow">When you were framed for murder and on the run,</font>

104
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,620
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh tried very hard to clear your name.</font>

105
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,420
<font color="yellow">And that is why...</font>

106
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,020
<font color="yellow">her brother died.</font>

107
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,990
<font color="yellow">Her brother died...</font>

108
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,990
<font color="yellow">because of me?</font>

109
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,220
<font color="yellow">It wasn't your fault exactly.</font>

110
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,050
<font color="yellow">- Il Jae...
-  That's the same thing!</font>

111
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

112
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,350
<font color="yellow">keep this from me?</font>

113
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,720
<font color="yellow">The memories of her are the cause of your headaches.</font>

114
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,420
<font color="yellow">That's why Professor Jin erased them.</font>

115
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,850
<font color="yellow">I don't remember anything.</font>

116
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,500
<font color="yellow">Don't try to, Sir.</font>

117
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,850
<font color="yellow">The headaches might return.</font>

118
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,920
<font color="yellow">Is that all?</font>

119
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,910
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

120
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,390
<font color="yellow">About my relationship with her.</font>

121
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,820
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

122
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
<font color="yellow">I think you were close...</font>

123
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,990
<font color="yellow">since you started as colleagues.</font>

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

125
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,490
<font color="yellow">all we know, Sir.</font>

126
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,490
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do is here.</font>

127
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,720
<font color="yellow">Are you working on getting rid of my wife's allies?</font>

128
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,120
<font color="yellow">We have a list of names and reasons to fire them all.</font>

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,290
<font color="yellow">Gather them all.</font>

130
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

131
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,750
<font color="yellow">I plan to shuffle the personnel around...</font>

132
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,420
<font color="yellow">including all the CEOs.</font>

133
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,290
<font color="yellow">Thank you for working for and putting up with...</font>

134
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,220
<font color="yellow">such an incompetent chairwoman.</font>

135
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,650
<font color="yellow">It's time you all retire.</font>

136
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,070
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, Sir?</font>

137
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,320
<font color="yellow">You're all fired.</font>

138
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,910
<font color="yellow">Hand in your resignation letters.</font>

139
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,300
<font color="yellow">This is unfair.</font>

140
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,820
<font color="yellow">It's too sudden.</font>

141
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,220
<font color="yellow">CEO Hong.</font>

142
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,680
<font color="yellow">At your daughter's wedding, a supplier gave you...</font>

143
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,490
<font color="yellow">50,000 dollars in the form of a gift.</font>

144
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,220
<font color="yellow">CEO Yang.</font>

145
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,750
<font color="yellow">You sent your wife and her family on a trip, and got reimbursed for it.</font>

146
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
<font color="yellow">CEO Cho.</font>

147
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,660
<font color="yellow">You bought an apartment for a female supplier.</font>

148
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,190
<font color="yellow">Does your wife know about it?</font>

149
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,460
<font color="yellow">The first mistake Gwi Ja made...</font>

150
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,620
<font color="yellow">was placing disloyal men like you in key positions,</font>

151
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,420
<font color="yellow">thinking that you'd be of help.</font>

152
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,190
<font color="yellow">Of course, the root will rot...</font>

153
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,090
<font color="yellow">if the water is rotten.</font>

154
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,880
<font color="yellow">If you do not turn in...</font>

155
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,690
<font color="yellow">your resignation letters within this morning,</font>

156
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,490
<font color="yellow">the police will find out...</font>

157
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,190
<font color="yellow">about all these disgusting things you've done.</font>

158
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,650
<font color="yellow">The choice is yours.</font>

159
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,320

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,390
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,550
<font color="yellow">Why is Mr Han still here?</font>

163
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,590
<font color="yellow">I will be loyal to you, Chairman. Please give me another chance.</font>

164
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,570
<font color="yellow">He helped out significantly during the general meeting.</font>

165
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,520
<font color="yellow">He can do a lot of things, so please leave him to me.</font>

166
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,220
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo, you need to get a promotion, too.</font>

167
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,620
<font color="yellow">I am satisfied with what I have.</font>

168
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,690
<font color="yellow">I will promote you as the vice chairman.</font>

169
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,350
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

170
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,220
<font color="yellow">What is this about your marrying Lawyer Oh?</font>

171
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,720
<font color="yellow">I understand that she's a good woman,</font>

172
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,590
<font color="yellow">but she's not someone for you to marry.</font>

173
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,620
<font color="yellow">My in-law needs to be one of the best families in Korea.</font>

174
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,890
<font color="yellow">It's probably a rumour made by the reporters.</font>

175
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,020
<font color="yellow">I have never...</font>

176
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,960
<font color="yellow">thought about marrying Lawyer Oh.</font>

177
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,190
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

178
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,050
<font color="yellow">Remember this, Gun Woo.</font>

179
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,820
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

180
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,150
<font color="yellow">the next chairman...</font>

00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,450

187
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,920
<font color="yellow">He gave up the home shopping channel and the golf course.</font>

188
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,020
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh, you should grasp his heart...</font>

189
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,790
<font color="yellow">while you have the chance.</font>

190
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,580
<font color="yellow">No, thanks. Stop saying that.</font>

191
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,820
<font color="yellow">Look around. You won't find anyone like him.</font>

192
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,520
<font color="yellow">I really respect him as a fellow man...</font>

193
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,690
<font color="yellow">for what he does to you, Lawyer Oh.</font>

194
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,140
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan helped out Soo Yeon a lot, too.</font>

195
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,220
<font color="yellow">Right, Soo Yeon?</font>

196
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,090
<font color="yellow">Who cares? He has no memory of her.</font>

197
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,790
<font color="yellow">They are as good as strangers.</font>

198
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,020
<font color="yellow">It's still left in Soo Yeon's memories.</font>

199
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,090
<font color="yellow">That's the problem.</font>

200
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,020
<font color="yellow">She is the only one who's suffering from this.</font>

201
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,850
<font color="yellow">There's a song that goes like this.</font>

202
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:11,020
<font color="yellow">If love hurts you a lot, it probably wasn't love at all.</font>

203
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,190
<font color="yellow">That's not how you sing it.</font>

204
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,120
<font color="yellow">Don't ruin a perfectly good song.</font>

205
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,890
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

206
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,220
<font color="yellow">It's simply because I'm drunk.</font>

207
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,320
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he coming?</font>

208
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,890
<font color="yellow">Who else is coming?</font>

209
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,070
<font color="yellow">What? Well...</font>

210
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,150

217
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,620

219
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,520
<font color="yellow">Oh, no one.</font>

220
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,920

-  Sure.</font>

229
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,120
<font color="yellow">given it a thought?</font>

-  My father...</font>

237
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,720

<font color="yellow">I am Lawyer Oh Soo Yeon. Nice to meet you.</font>

246
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,690
<font color="yellow">It feels like you're avoiding me on purpose.</font>

247
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,590
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

248
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,090
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

249
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,620
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Soo Yeon.</font>

250
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,350
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

251
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,850
<font color="yellow">forget about her.</font>

252
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
<font color="yellow">Chairman!</font>

253
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,120
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

254
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,550
<font color="yellow">You look troubled.</font>

255
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,790
<font color="yellow">Is this because of Lawyer Oh?</font>

256
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,490
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,</font>

257
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,120
<font color="yellow">I feel much better.</font>

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,220
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

260
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,150

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,350
<font color="yellow">among pharmaceutical companies?</font>

266
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,190
<font color="yellow">Geukdong Pharmaceutical is the most interested.</font>

267
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,620
<font color="yellow">They were always behind Dodo Pharmaceutical.</font>

268
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,950
<font color="yellow">- I'll seal the deal tomorrow.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

269
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,090
<font color="yellow">This new MK2 vaccine is...</font>

270
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,750
<font color="yellow">much more effective and cheaper...</font>

271
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,490
<font color="yellow">than mutant influenza vaccine produced by Dodo Pharmaceutical.</font>

272
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,800

273
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,190
<font color="yellow">Dodo Pharmaceutical has always defended their position on top,</font>

274
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,660
<font color="yellow">but things do not look promising thanks to this brand new vaccine.</font>

275
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,320
<font color="yellow">The fall of Dodo Pharmaceutical will affect the entire group.</font>

276
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,660
<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman Do, what's our plan?</font>

277
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,220
<font color="yellow">There is one way to walk out of this crisis.</font>

278
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,660
<font color="yellow">We'll put some of our subsidiaries through a paid-in capital increase.</font>

279
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,190
<font color="yellow">- Paid-in capital increase?
-  Yes.</font>

280
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,350
<font color="yellow">Based on last year's sales,</font>

281
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,820
<font color="yellow">we'll issue new stock shares...</font>

282
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,320
<font color="yellow">for companies that lost money.</font>

283
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,420
<font color="yellow">Ga Din, I'm in a meeting now.</font>

284
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,020
<font color="yellow">What's a "paid-in capital increase"?</font>

285
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,920
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo will put out Dodo Hotel for a paid-in capital increase.</font>

286
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,920
<font color="yellow">That will damage the percentage of your shares.</font>

287
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,520
<font color="yellow">Shin Young, it's me.</font>

288
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,450
<font color="yellow">Walk out of the room and talk to me.</font>

289
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,630
<font color="yellow">I'm outside. You can talk.</font>

290
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,590
<font color="yellow">That means he'll issue new Dodo Hotel stocks.</font>

291
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,090
<font color="yellow">What will happen then?</font>

292
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,690
<font color="yellow">If Gun Woo gets those shares,</font>

293
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,220
<font color="yellow">your ownership of the hotel...</font>

294
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,450
<font color="yellow">could be threatened.</font>

295
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

296
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,390
<font color="yellow">He's up to something then.</font>

297
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,120
<font color="yellow">We have to stop the recapitalisation.</font>

298
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
<font color="yellow">Can you do that?</font>

299
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,450
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Trust me.</font>

300

<font color="yellow">Dodo Corporation, Dodo Insurance, Dodo Engineering...</font>

301
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,520
<font color="yellow">and Dodo Hotel will be recapitalised.</font>

302
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,660
<font color="yellow">Not the hotel.</font>

303
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,890
<font color="yellow">For as long as I'm around, there's no way you can...</font>

304
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,120
<font color="yellow">recapitalise on the hotel.</font>

305
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,920
<font color="yellow">You lost over 10 million dollars last year.</font>

306
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,320
<font color="yellow">If you keep going...</font>

307
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,390
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that, Vice Chairman.</font>

308
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,420
<font color="yellow">Don't mention last year's numbers.</font>

309
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,890
<font color="yellow">Don't you know I turned it around since I took over this year?</font>

310
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,990
<font color="yellow">Sir, Dodo Hotel must be recapitalised.</font>

311
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,590
<font color="yellow">Why are we in this mess?</font>

312
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,610
<font color="yellow">It's because you bought B World...</font>

313
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,660
<font color="yellow">and that threatened Dodo Pharmaceutical.</font>

314
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,100
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to make someone else pay the price?</font>

315
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,350
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan has the patent to the MK2 vaccine.</font>

316
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,710
<font color="yellow">Why did you sign...</font>

317
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,720
<font color="yellow">a Shareholders' Voting Agreement with our enemy?</font>

318
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

319
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,050
<font color="yellow">That's because I plan...</font>

320
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,890
<font color="yellow">to marry him.</font>

321
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,750
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

322
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,660
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Kang Gi Tan.</font>

323
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,310
<font color="yellow">Shin Young...</font>

324
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,550
<font color="yellow">It's not a bad idea.</font>

325
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,520
<font color="yellow">He's involved in many of our transactions,</font>

326
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,920
<font color="yellow">including the shipbuilding deal.</font>

327
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,660
<font color="yellow">If Shin Young were to marry him,</font>

328
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,820
<font color="yellow">that would help us overcome this crisis.</font>

329
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,220
<font color="yellow">We can discuss this later.</font>

330
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,550
<font color="yellow">Let's conclude this meeting.</font>

331
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
<font color="yellow">Shin Young.</font>

332
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,520
<font color="yellow">You manage a hotel.</font>

333
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,590
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what recapitalisation is?</font>

334
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,420
<font color="yellow">I studied fashion.</font>

335
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,390
<font color="yellow">Have you heard of "windowpane gingham check patterns"?</font>

336
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,090
<font color="yellow">You don't make clothes.</font>

337
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,090
<font color="yellow">If you want to be my partner, start studying.</font>

338
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,120
<font color="yellow">Studying?</font>

339
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,990
<font color="yellow">I can do that.</font>

340
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,890
<font color="yellow">However, you need to be the one to teach me.</font>

341
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,020
<font color="yellow">I'm not bored enough to tutor you.</font>

342
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,840
<font color="yellow">Do it. I want to study hard...</font>

343
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,920
<font color="yellow">with you.</font>

344
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,920
<font color="yellow">She wants to study, not have fun.</font>

345
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,220
<font color="yellow">Say yes, Sir.</font>

346
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,820
<font color="yellow">Very well.</font>

347
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,660
<font color="yellow">- I'll teach you.
-  Really?</font>

348
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,930
<font color="yellow">No homework or exams.</font>

349
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,820
<font color="yellow">Then I'll really study hard.</font>

350
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,020
<font color="yellow">How did you prevent the recapitalisation?</font>

351
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,660
<font color="yellow">I told my dad that I'd marry you.</font>

352
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,790
<font color="yellow">He didn't object.</font>

353
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,820
<font color="yellow">When should we get married?</font>

354
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,850
<font color="yellow">This autumn?</font>

355
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,390
<font color="yellow">We'll go on our honeymoon in the Mediterranean.</font>

356
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,990
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon, I think you should tutor her.</font>

357
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,290
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

358
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,300
<font color="yellow">Are you going back on your promise?</font>

359
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,560
<font color="yellow">I'm too scared to teach you.</font>

360
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,470
<font color="yellow">I'll come by to your suite...</font>

361
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,320
<font color="yellow">- this evening.
-  Shin Young.</font>

362
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,350
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth before I have the hotel recapitalised.</font>

363
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,920
<font color="yellow">(Dodo Pharmaceutical Shares Drop)</font>

364
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,790
<font color="yellow">- I won this time.
-  You did.</font>

365
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,920
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

366
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,520
<font color="yellow">Hey! Be quiet.</font>

367
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,220
<font color="yellow">The mayor's reading the paper.</font>

368
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,450
<font color="yellow">4984, you have a visitor.</font>

369
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,450
<font color="yellow">Who could it be?</font>

370
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan or Gun Woo?</font>

371
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,990
<font color="yellow">I set them at each other's throats.</font>

372
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,590
<font color="yellow">The wounded one would need my help.</font>

373
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,420
<font color="yellow">You're here often.</font>

374
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,990
<font color="yellow">Do you need my help?</font>

375
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,220
<font color="yellow">You won't offer it even if I did.</font>

376
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,190
<font color="yellow">If you're willing to get rid of Gi Tan for me,</font>

377
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,920
<font color="yellow">I'd be willing to help you.</font>

378
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,850
<font color="yellow">You'd say the same to Gi Tan if he were here.</font>

379
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,890
<font color="yellow">"I'd be willing to help if you're willing to get rid of Gun Woo."</font>

380
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,350
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

381
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,920
<font color="yellow">You played on both sides.</font>

382
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,490
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

383
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,220
<font color="yellow">I thought long and hard about you.</font>

384
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,050
<font color="yellow">"How much of you is real..."</font>

385
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,090
<font color="yellow">"and how much is a mask?"</font>

386
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,390
<font color="yellow">That's interesting.</font>

387
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,850
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

388
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,020
<font color="yellow">Your betraying me...</font>

389
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,820
<font color="yellow">wasn't only because of Soo Yeon.</font>

390
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,850
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

391
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,650
<font color="yellow">come to Korea with the sole purpose of...</font>

392
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,620
<font color="yellow">taking me down?</font>

393
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,620
<font color="yellow">Do you still think...</font>

394
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,950
<font color="yellow">I killed my stepfather by accident?</font>

395
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,690
<font color="yellow">Where is your mum? Where is your mum?</font>

396
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,020
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

397
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,300
<font color="yellow">I thought that...</font>

398
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,290
<font color="yellow">if I only had the gun,</font>

399
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,490
<font color="yellow">I could protect my mother from that monster.</font>

400
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,890
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

401
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,050
<font color="yellow">it took me 10 years to get a hold of that gun.</font>

402
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,450
<font color="yellow">My stepfather...</font>

403
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,290
<font color="yellow">was as suspicious as you are.</font>

404
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
<font color="yellow">Come here, you dirty tramp!</font>

405
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,020
<font color="yellow">That monster...</font>

406
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,520
<font color="yellow">was high on drugs and alcohol, and started hitting my mother.</font>

407
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,990
<font color="yellow">The time had come.</font>

408
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,020
<font color="yellow">I could have pleaded self-defence.</font>

409
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,520
<font color="yellow">- But...
-  Gun Woo.</font>

410
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
<font color="yellow">That day,</font>

411
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,350
<font color="yellow">you came by.</font>

412
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,520
<font color="yellow">- Don't shoot.
-  They're here...</font>

413
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,090
<font color="yellow">to see you.</font>

414
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,120
<font color="yellow">I'll call you when the time is right.</font>

415
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,120
<font color="yellow">Until then, use the fury inside to prepare yourself.</font>

416
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,320
<font color="yellow">Turn your hatred for the world...</font>

417
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,120
<font color="yellow">into ambition.</font>

418
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,790
<font color="yellow">What do you say?</font>

419
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,120
<font color="yellow">You only live once.</font>

420
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,480
<font color="yellow">Isn't it worth a shot?</font>

421
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,550
<font color="yellow">You planned to use me...</font>

422
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,190
<font color="yellow">to swallow Dodo Group whole.</font>

423
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
<font color="yellow">My plan...</font>

424
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,890
<font color="yellow">was to use you...</font>

425
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,820
<font color="yellow">to do the exact same thing.</font>

426
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
<font color="yellow">You said...</font>

427
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,050
<font color="yellow">you didn't want to become a monster like me.</font>

428
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,590
<font color="yellow">Did you pretend...</font>

429
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,420
<font color="yellow">to love Soo Yeon to deceive me?</font>

430
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,990
<font color="yellow">There was one thing I didn't foresee.</font>

431
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
<font color="yellow">I actually...</font>

432
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,850
<font color="yellow">came to love her...</font>

433
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,620
<font color="yellow">with all my heart.</font>

434
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,420
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't touched her,</font>

435
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,220
<font color="yellow">then our alliance...</font>

436
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,550
<font color="yellow">could have lasted a little longer.</font>

437
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
<font color="yellow">Too bad.</font>

438
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,120
<font color="yellow">Had I understood you a little sooner,</font>

439
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,210
<font color="yellow">we could have become amazing partners.</font>

440
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,350
<font color="yellow">It's not too late.</font>

441
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,090
<font color="yellow">If you take out Gi Tan,</font>

442
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,760
<font color="yellow">I'm willing to join hands with you.</font>

443
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,590
<font color="yellow">Just leave Soo Yeon alone.</font>

444
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,890
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

445
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,500
<font color="yellow">Forget about your pride just this once...</font>

446
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,810
<font color="yellow">and beg Dad for his forgiveness.</font>

447
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,320
<font color="yellow">He fired everyone who sided with you...</font>

448
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
<font color="yellow">How dare he?</font>

449
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,090
<font color="yellow">How dare he temporarily seize my assets?</font>

450
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,410
<font color="yellow">He's threatening to send you to prison.</font>

451
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,490
<font color="yellow">This is no time to get angry.</font>

452
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,290
<font color="yellow">I won't apologise to your father.</font>

453
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,650
<font color="yellow">Never.</font>

454
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,220
<font color="yellow">We need to appease him somehow.</font>

455
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,750
<font color="yellow">Then we can start over.</font>

456
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,820
<font color="yellow">You said there's nothing you can't do for me.</font>

457
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,850
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

458
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,750
<font color="yellow">Mum has something to say.</font>

459
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,690
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

460
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,920
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

461
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,190
<font color="yellow">was wrong.</font>

462
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,220
<font color="yellow">- Were you?
-  Yes.</font>

463
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,590
<font color="yellow">So let's reconcile.</font>

464
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,150
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

465
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,840
<font color="yellow">Your clothes.</font>

466
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,150
<font color="yellow">Take this...</font>

467
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,950
<font color="yellow">and get out of my house.</font>

468
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,460
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
-  Father.</font>

469
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,090
<font color="yellow">Both of your names will be deleted forever...</font>

470
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,490
<font color="yellow">on my will.</font>

471
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,490
<font color="yellow">Will you really be like this?</font>

472
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,720
<font color="yellow">I just changed my mind to apologise to you.</font>

473
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,750
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

474
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,920
<font color="yellow">What did Lawyer Oh say about...</font>

475
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,620
<font color="yellow">inheritance of assets?</font>

476
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,020
<font color="yellow">You can leave out anyone who tried to kill an immediate family member.</font>

477
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,450
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

478
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,090
<font color="yellow">Father, are you serious?</font>

479
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,890
<font color="yellow">You and your mother shouldn't be saying a word!</font>

480
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,490
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong, what are you doing? Kick them out right now.</font>

481
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,520
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

482
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,020
<font color="yellow">I won't leave.</font>

483
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,790
<font color="yellow">This is my house.</font>

484
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,220
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

485
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,490
<font color="yellow">washed your dirty uniform and made dozens of lunch boxes...</font>

486
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,190
<font color="yellow">for our employees to build up this house myself.</font>

487
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,620
<font color="yellow">I would never leave.</font>

488
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,350
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Kick her out!</font>

489
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,060
<font color="yellow">Did you think I'd give up?</font>

490
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,220
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

491
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
<font color="yellow">Half of Dodo Group is mine!</font>

492
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,290
<font color="yellow">I will claim my rights!</font>

493
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,530
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing around?</font>

494
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,820
<font color="yellow">Kick him out.</font>

495
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,850
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

496
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,690
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

497
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,490
<font color="yellow">I am your eldest son.</font>

498
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,220
<font color="yellow">That is why I am...</font>

499
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,820
<font color="yellow">more disgusted and disappointed in you.</font>

500
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,820
<font color="yellow">Do you think we have failed you?</font>

501
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,990
<font color="yellow">Our household is like this not because of me or Mum.</font>

502
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,050
<font color="yellow">It's because of you. You made us like this.</font>

503
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,290
<font color="yellow">Get out of here!</font>

504
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,290
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

505
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,020
<font color="yellow">Watch me.</font>

506
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,350
<font color="yellow">You will regret...</font>

507
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,150
<font color="yellow">this day when you have...</font>

508
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,190
<font color="yellow">kicked us out.</font>

509
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,650
<font color="yellow">You should sleep if you're tired.</font>

510
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

511
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,190
<font color="yellow">There will be no more trouble...</font>

512
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,590
<font color="yellow">now that I've kicked them out.</font>

513
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,820
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

514
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,220
<font color="yellow">How dare you touch me?</font>

515
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,730
<font color="yellow">You idiots!</font>

516
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,360
<font color="yellow">I am Hwang Gwi Ja.</font>

517
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,650
<font color="yellow">I'm the chairwoman of Dodo Group!</font>

518
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,790
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

519
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,570
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

520
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,850
<font color="yellow">How dare you push her?</font>

521
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,150
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

522
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,690
<font color="yellow">Mum. Are you okay?</font>

523
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,350
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm sorry.</font>

524
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,420
<font color="yellow">It's all because I'm incompetent.</font>

525
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,320
<font color="yellow">You're not incompetent.</font>

526
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,390
<font color="yellow">Don't ever say that.</font>

527
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,270
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

528
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,620
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

529
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,620
<font color="yellow">My greed has ruined you.</font>

530
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,490
<font color="yellow">Don't say that, Mum.</font>

531
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,360
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

532
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,520
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

533
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,160
<font color="yellow">I should have protected you no matter what it takes.</font>

534
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,220
<font color="yellow">I told you, don't say that.</font>

535
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,520
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

536
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,550
<font color="yellow">all because of Gun Woo.</font>

537
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,890
<font color="yellow">If he didn't suddenly appear,</font>

538
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,320
<font color="yellow">Father would have never done anything like this.</font>

539
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,690
<font color="yellow">Mum, get up.</font>

540
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,220
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

541
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,890
<font color="yellow">Do you have anywhere to go?</font>

542
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,690
<font color="yellow">You probably don't have money.</font>

543
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,410
<font color="yellow">Get lost...</font>

544
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,210
<font color="yellow">if you don't want to die.</font>

545
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,220
<font color="yellow">If you're willing to go to the US, I'll help you with your living cost.</font>

546
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,550
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

547
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,150
<font color="yellow">When we get a divorce, half of his assets is mine.</font>

548
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,320
<font color="yellow">Tell him that I am not afraid of getting a divorce!</font>

549
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,950
<font color="yellow">Even if you do get alimony, you'd have to give it back.</font>

550
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,900
<font color="yellow">You have damaged the company very much while you were in charge.</font>

551
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,920
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

552
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,320
<font color="yellow">My mum suffered much more than this!</font>

553
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,050
<font color="yellow">I think now I know how you felt back then.</font>

554
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,820
<font color="yellow">Get lost, you jerk!</font>

555
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,220
<font color="yellow">Brother.</font>

556
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,220
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Oh, right.</font>

557
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,520
<font color="yellow">You didn't want me to call you that.</font>

558
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,050
<font color="yellow">If you'd been a brother to me, I probably would have saved you.</font>

559
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,750
<font color="yellow">You two...</font>

560
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,620
<font color="yellow">probably never have starved.</font>

561
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,790
<font color="yellow">My mother and I...</font>

562
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,850
<font color="yellow">know what it is like to starve.</font>

563
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,350
<font color="yellow">If you can't take it,</font>

564
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,950
<font color="yellow">you should beg.</font>

565
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,890
<font color="yellow">You can beg me.</font>

566
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,120
<font color="yellow">Chairman's son is here.</font>

567
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,150
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

568
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,750
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

569
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,390
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do...</font>

570
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,220
<font color="yellow">about this humiliation?</font>

571
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,720
<font color="yellow">Just wait, Mum.</font>

572
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,790
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

573
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,820
<font color="yellow">I will get him.</font>

574
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,520
<font color="yellow">We have chosen the subsidiaries, Father.</font>

575
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,100
<font color="yellow">We need the board's approval to go into paid-in capital...</font>

576
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,950
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

577
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,790
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

578
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:20,190
<font color="yellow">Who allowed this stranger in here?</font>

579
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,560
<font color="yellow">Chairman, what is with you?</font>

580
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,650
<font color="yellow">It's me, Gun Woo.</font>

581
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,590
<font color="yellow">You're not my son.</font>

582
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,220
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong, go and bring Gwang Woo.</font>

583
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,420
<font color="yellow">It's me, Gun Woo.</font>

584
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,290
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

585
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,780
<font color="yellow">How dare you act like my son? Get out of here!</font>

586
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,390
<font color="yellow">Chairman, he's your former secretary...</font>

587
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,350
<font color="yellow">Yoon Ja Young's son.</font>

588
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,450
<font color="yellow">What? Ja Young?</font>

589
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,060
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

590
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,390
<font color="yellow">She had an affair with one of my employees.</font>

591
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,150
<font color="yellow">Are you his son?</font>

592
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,420
<font color="yellow">- Bring Doctor Hwang.
-  Yes.</font>

593
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,420
<font color="yellow">I was going to take Mother...</font>

594
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,710
<font color="yellow">to my father's graveyard. Where is my wife?</font>

595
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,650
<font color="yellow">Chairman, please hang in there.</font>

596
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,190
<font color="yellow">Just let him be, Mr Gong.</font>

597
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,450
<font color="yellow">Maybe she's upset that I forgot our anniversary.</font>

598
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,920
<font color="yellow">Honey! Gwi Ja!</font>

599
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,120
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

600
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,890
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

601
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,020
<font color="yellow">Chairman, Chairman.</font>

602
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,120
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that it's not dementia?</font>

603
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,020
<font color="yellow">It's a side effect caused by his medicine.</font>

604
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,650
<font color="yellow">It continues to worsen for a simple side effect.</font>

605
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,220
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and make sure he takes his pills.</font>

606
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,690
<font color="yellow">Don't forget the shots either.</font>

607
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,390
<font color="yellow">You may leave.</font>

608
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,950
<font color="yellow">How long will you hide that he has dementia?</font>

609
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,280
<font color="yellow">I can't bring it up yet.</font>

610
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,450
<font color="yellow">When will you tell everyone?</font>

611
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,950
<font color="yellow">We're currently editing his will.</font>

612
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,060
<font color="yellow">Once Gwi Ja finds out, that will won't have...</font>

613
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,690
<font color="yellow">any lawful significance.</font>

614
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,350
<font color="yellow">If this continues, his muscles will be paralysed...</font>

615
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,220
<font color="yellow">Just do as I say.</font>

616
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,750
<font color="yellow">You're getting paid for this. Why do you have so many opinions?</font>

617
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,790
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

618
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,450
<font color="yellow">After we're done with his will,</font>

619
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,750
<font color="yellow">I'll send him off to a care centre.</font>

620
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,820
<font color="yellow">After that, you will become...</font>

621
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,150
<font color="yellow">the chairman of the board of Dodo Hospital.</font>

622
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,150
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

623
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,590
<font color="yellow">It's unbelievable how the wife of Dodo Group...</font>

624
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,990
<font color="yellow">had nowhere else to go but to return to her family's house.</font>

625
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,150
<font color="yellow">You don't have to add to this.</font>

626
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,220
<font color="yellow">I am already embarrassed as it is.</font>

627
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,820
<font color="yellow">How long will you stay here?</font>

628
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,720
<font color="yellow">Do you want us to leave?</font>

629
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,920
<font color="yellow">I can't take care of you because I'm really busy.</font>

630
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,890
<font color="yellow">Can you cook your own food?</font>

631
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,490
<font color="yellow">Be nice, will you, Congresswoman?</font>

632
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,350
<font color="yellow">We aren't refugees.</font>

633
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,290
<font color="yellow">Mr Han.</font>

634
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,590
<font color="yellow">Are you ignoring my calls, too?</font>

635
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,830
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm down and out?</font>

636
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,920
<font color="yellow">It's not like that at all, Sir.</font>

637
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,950
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

638
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,350
<font color="yellow">Give me a moment.</font>

639
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,950
<font color="yellow">This is embarrassing.</font>

640
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,650
<font color="yellow">Why is he always so frivolous?</font>

641
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,950
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

642
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,620
<font color="yellow">Do you know that Yang Dong Yi was released?</font>

643
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,990
<font color="yellow">Where is he right now?</font>

644
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,370
<font color="yellow">I heard he opened an office in Yeongdeungpo.</font>

645
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,090
<font color="yellow">Get me his address.</font>

646
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,720
<font color="yellow">I'm staying at my uncle's in Hongeun-dong.</font>

647
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

648
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,790
<font color="yellow">It's me, Han Sang Goo.</font>

649
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,560
<font color="yellow">I was hurt.</font>

650
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,350
<font color="yellow">You said you'd take me back.</font>

651
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,670
<font color="yellow">Why did you avoid me?</font>

652
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,930
<font color="yellow">I'm here right now, aren't I?</font>

653
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:02,990
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

654
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,490
<font color="yellow">I can make a living without your help.</font>

655
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,360
<font color="yellow">I need to ask for a favour.</font>

656
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,190
<font color="yellow">Do you need a loan?</font>

657
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,190
<font color="yellow">I charge a lot, you know?</font>

658
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,690
<font color="yellow">Do Gun Woo.</font>

659
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,790
<font color="yellow">Get rid of him for me.</font>

660
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,790
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you kill him.</font>

661
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,090
<font color="yellow">I don't do that any more.</font>

662
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,490
<font color="yellow">- Please leave.
-  One large cheque.</font>

663
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,220
<font color="yellow">How about that? Isn't it worth it now?</font>

664
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,820
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows you're penniless.</font>

665
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,470
<font color="yellow">Can you really pay up?</font>

666
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:51,260
<font color="yellow">I'm Do Gwang Woo.</font>

667
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,170
<font color="yellow">The heir of Dodo Group.</font>

668
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,180
<font color="yellow">So what if you are?</font>

669
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,990
<font color="yellow">I heard Do Gun Woo's the man in charge.</font>

670
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,620
<font color="yellow">The company will be mine once he's out of the picture.</font>

671
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,220
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you then.</font>

672
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:07,060
<font color="yellow">I don't take after the fact payments.</font>

673
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,390
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. 1.5 biggies.</font>

674
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,150
<font color="yellow">I want 1.5 million.</font>

675
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,210
<font color="yellow">Do you have to drive a hard bargain?</font>

676
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,850
<font color="yellow">Take it or leave it. Find someone else.</font>

677
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,920
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

678
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,390
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

679
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
<font color="yellow">1.5 million dollars.</font>

680
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,420
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

681
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,590
<font color="yellow">Please sign this contract.</font>

682
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,390
<font color="yellow">What... What's this?</font>

683
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,150
<font color="yellow">"Waiver of Body Parts"?</font>

684
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,870
<font color="yellow">I'm a loan shark.</font>

685
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,120
<font color="yellow">Did you expect an insurance form?</font>

686
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,620
<font color="yellow">You're funny.</font>

687
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,590
<font color="yellow">Read it carefully before you sign it.</font>

688
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,220
<font color="yellow">It's a serious document.</font>

689
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,190
<font color="yellow">Promise that...</font>

690
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,190
<font color="yellow">you won't mess this up.</font>

691
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,420
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry. Just wire the money in time.</font>

692
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,650
<font color="yellow">We have too little on B World.</font>

693
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,210
<font color="yellow">This isn't enough to win the appeal.</font>

694
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,150
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for more files. Give it some time.</font>

695
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,850
<font color="yellow">The prosecutor in charge of the appeal...</font>

696
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,290
<font color="yellow">Is he trustworthy?</font>

697
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,370
<font color="yellow">I'm meeting him this evening.</font>

698
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:54,350
<font color="yellow">You can see for yourself if you care to join me.</font>

699
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,120
<font color="yellow">- Soo Yeon.
-  Yes, Gi...</font>

700
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,650
<font color="yellow">I heard we used to be close.</font>

701
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,650
<font color="yellow">He saw a photo you two took when you worked at Dodo Group.</font>

702
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,390
<font color="yellow">Could you excuse us?</font>

703
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

704
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,290
<font color="yellow">I heard...</font>

705
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,490
<font color="yellow">your brother died because of me.</font>

706
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,490
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

707
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,950
<font color="yellow">I found out too late.</font>

708
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,420
<font color="yellow">It's in the past.</font>

709
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,480
<font color="yellow">Don't concern yourself.</font>

710
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,620
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo, was it?</font>

711
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,490
<font color="yellow">His name, I mean.</font>

712
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,220
<font color="yellow">If you don't mind,</font>

713
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,150
<font color="yellow">I'd like to visit his place at the charnel house.</font>

714
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,200
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

715
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,150
<font color="yellow">We used to be friends.</font>

716
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,020
<font color="yellow">How about we speak freely like we used to?</font>

717
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,220
<font color="yellow">It must feel awkward trying to be polite to a friend.</font>

718
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,650
<font color="yellow">I prefer things as it is right now.</font>

719
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,850
<font color="yellow">I'll have no reason to see you after Il Jae's trial.</font>

720
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,290
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

721
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,820
<font color="yellow">afraid I'll suffer?</font>

722
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,990
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Choi.</font>

723
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,550
<font color="yellow">We'll leave right now.</font>

724
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,190
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

725
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,500
<font color="yellow">What is Prosecutor Choi like?</font>

726
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,730
<font color="yellow">His peers know him for being upright and honest.</font>

727
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,320
<font color="yellow">My prosecutor contact said...</font>

728
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,290
<font color="yellow">he has enemies because he's so transparent.</font>

729
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,290
<font color="yellow">Then we can trust him.</font>

730
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,790
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Choi is here.</font>

731
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,790
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

732
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,920
<font color="yellow">- I'm Kang Gi Tan.
-  I'm Moon Tae Gwang.</font>

733
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,980
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

734
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,390
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh told me a lot about you.</font>

735
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:21,750
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

736
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,090
<font color="yellow">I went over the files you sent.</font>

737
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,140
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is worse than I thought.</font>

738
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,720
<font color="yellow">If you knew him,</font>

739
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,590
<font color="yellow">you'd be even more shocked.</font>

740
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,990
<font color="yellow">I find it embarrassing and infuriating that...</font>

741
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,190
<font color="yellow">he used to be a fellow prosecutor.</font>

742
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,150
<font color="yellow">He has many contacts.</font>

743
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,290
<font color="yellow">I hope that...</font>

744
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,290
<font color="yellow">you won't give in to pressure.</font>

745
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,350
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

746
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,420
<font color="yellow">I'm not the kind of person who gives in to temptation.</font>

747
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:05,890
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

748
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,220
<font color="yellow">I'm away from the office.</font>

749
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,120
<font color="yellow">Can I come in, Sir?</font>

750
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:19,790
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

751
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,890
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

752
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:29,950
<font color="yellow">You must know...</font>

753
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
<font color="yellow">Congressman Hwang Jae Man.</font>

754
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,290
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir. I'm Choi Jeong Gook.</font>

755
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,500
<font color="yellow">This is his daughter, Congresswoman Hwang Ji Soo.</font>

756
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,850
<font color="yellow">I'm pleased to meet you.</font>

757
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,890
<font color="yellow">Take a seat.</font>

758
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,720
<font color="yellow">He was a rookie when I was a deputy-chief prosecutor.</font>

759
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,290
<font color="yellow">That's when...</font>

760
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,090
<font color="yellow">I noticed his potentials.</font>

761
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,750
<font color="yellow">Next week,</font>

762
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,750
<font color="yellow">I will announce that I will seek my party's nomination...</font>

763
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,200
<font color="yellow">to run for presidency.</font>

764
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,860
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm aware of that.</font>

765
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,020
<font color="yellow">But it just so happens that...</font>

766
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,190
<font color="yellow">my son-in-law's trial begins on the same day.</font>

767
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:16,850
<font color="yellow">You control...</font>

768
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,190
<font color="yellow">the future of my campaign and our country.</font>

769
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,290
<font color="yellow">Do you get what I mean?</font>

770
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,210
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

771
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,550
<font color="yellow">If Mr Hwang becomes President,</font>

772
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,550
<font color="yellow">he will make you the youngest ever superintendent public prosecutor.</font>

773
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,920
<font color="yellow">You could go even higher than that.</font>

774
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:40,150
<font color="yellow">Don't say such a thing, Mr Jang.</font>

775
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,220
<font color="yellow">I'll be direct.</font>

776
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,550
<font color="yellow">This appeal to the Supreme Court...</font>

777
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,720
<font color="yellow">Please turn it down.</font>

778
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,650
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

779
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:53,990
<font color="yellow">Let me...</font>

780
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,020
<font color="yellow">pour you a drink.</font>

781

787
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,290
<font color="yellow">At my office. Is something wrong?</font>

788
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,490

<font color="yellow">I'm an expert at all crimes that a person can commit.</font>

938
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:53,190
<font color="yellow">Did you think I'd fall for one of your flimsy tricks?</font>

939
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,720
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

940
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,990
<font color="yellow">Would I use such a flimsy trick?</font>

941
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:04,050
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't me or you,</font>

942
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,190
<font color="yellow">then it must be Gwang Woo.</font>

943
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,820
<font color="yellow">He lost everything to Gun Woo...</font>

944
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,050
<font color="yellow">and now, he lost his mind.</font>

945
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:16,350
<font color="yellow">But you're a month too late.</font>

946
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,560
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon is completely mine.</font>

947
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,390
<font color="yellow">That's what happened.</font>

948
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,290
<font color="yellow">It could've been staged.</font>

949
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,590
<font color="yellow">He did it to himself.</font>

950
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:38,210
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo must think I'm at death's door right now.</font>

951
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,050
<font color="yellow">I believe so.</font>

952
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,020
<font color="yellow">I'm listening.</font>

953
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,390
<font color="yellow">Destroy the files on Il Jae which you took from me.</font>

954
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,420
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

955
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,850
<font color="yellow">I hope you're not badly hurt.</font>

956
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,620
<font color="yellow">My boys are experts.</font>

957
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,590
<font color="yellow">When do you think...</font>

958
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,890
<font color="yellow">you can pay me the rest of the money?</font>

959
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,350
<font color="yellow">My secretary will bring it to you right now.</font>

960
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:18,650
<font color="yellow">I like your style. You're so straightforward.</font>

961
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,290
<font color="yellow">Look after yourself.</font>

962
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,670
<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

963
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,320
<font color="yellow">If Gwang Woo pays me, too,</font>

964
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,850
<font color="yellow">it'll be like earning twice as much for just one job.</font>

965
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:45,220
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

966
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,220
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

967
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,790
<font color="yellow">Burn, baby, burn.</font>

968
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:53,220
<font color="yellow">This will turn into money.</font>

969
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,790
<font color="yellow">You're so smart, Dong Yi.</font>

970
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:02,350
<font color="yellow">Do you think he staged this?</font>

971
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:03,890
<font color="yellow">I'm positive.</font>

972
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:05,550
<font color="yellow">Why would he?</font>

973
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,850
<font color="yellow">Drive to the hospital.</font>

974
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,290
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

975
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,320
<font color="yellow">Where is the patient?</font>

976
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:25,820
<font color="yellow">He went to the roof garden to get some air.</font>

977
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,390
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you can go home soon.</font>

978
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,150
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

979
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,420
<font color="yellow">Did I ever...</font>

980
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,750
<font color="yellow">make your heart flutter?</font>

981
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:50,590
<font color="yellow">Did I ever...</font>

982
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,990
<font color="yellow">make your heart pound?</font>

983
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,850
<font color="yellow">Mine flutters and pounds all the time.</font>

984
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:05,820
<font color="yellow">Don't you...</font>

985
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,220
<font color="yellow">want to know...</font>

986
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:09,850
<font color="yellow">how that feels?</font>

987
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,690
<font color="yellow">Well... I don't...</font>

988
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,350
<font color="yellow">(Monster)</font>

989
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:04,050
<font color="yellow">He's deceiving Soo Yeon, too.</font>

990
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,790
<font color="yellow">We have to reveal the truth...</font>

991
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,090
<font color="yellow">before it's too late.</font>

992
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,420
<font color="yellow">We have to stop it. If Gi Tan gets his hands on it,</font>

993
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,710
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group will collapse.</font>

994
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,580
<font color="yellow">Didn't you come here to ruin Dodo Group?</font>

995
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,590
<font color="yellow">I shall leave you, Sir.</font>

996
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,050
<font color="yellow">It should be give and take.</font>

997
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:17,390
<font color="yellow">I'm impressed, Gun Woo.</font>

998
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:19,090
<font color="yellow">I didn't think he'd do this.</font>

999
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,290
<font color="yellow">Some things can only be attained by risking your life.</font>

1000
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,990
<font color="yellow">I will judge Il Jae myself.</font>
