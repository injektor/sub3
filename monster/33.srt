<font color="yellow">How do you...</font>

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,130
<font color="yellow">know my name?</font>

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,030
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,800
<font color="yellow">It's me, Gi Tan. I'm Soo Yeon.</font>

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,860
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,260
<font color="yellow">I'm Soo Yeon. Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,230
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Gi Tan?</font>

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,600
<font color="yellow">Are you the one...</font>

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,230
<font color="yellow">who saved me...</font>

11

<font color="yellow">with the MK2 vaccine at the lab?</font>

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,760
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,930

<font color="yellow">Have we...</font>

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, what's wrong? Gi Tan.</font>

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,430
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,060
<font color="yellow">Get him to a room and call a doctor.</font>

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,060
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you let Lawyer Oh meet Mr Kang.</font>

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,930
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon's heart is broken because of Gi Tan.</font>

22
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,220
<font color="yellow">I didn't think I could hide it.</font>

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,500
<font color="yellow">But still,</font>

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,260
<font color="yellow">you don't have to be the only one who's hurt in this.</font>

25
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,030
<font color="yellow">Bring him.</font>

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,130
<font color="yellow">Over here.</font>

27
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,680
<font color="yellow">Find out what's going on.</font>

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,700
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,030
<font color="yellow">Wait. Lawyer Oh, you'd better not come.</font>

30
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,660
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak, you can explain.</font>

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,940
<font color="yellow">Talk to me, Soo Tak.</font>

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,600
<font color="yellow">What happened to Gi Tan?</font>

33
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,200
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin is on the phone.</font>

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,420
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin, Chairman isn't doing so well.</font>

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,410
<font color="yellow">If it's all right, could you come to Korea right now?</font>

36
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,770
<font color="yellow">If I leave now,</font>

37
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,460
<font color="yellow">I'll be at the airport by 12am.</font>

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,600
<font color="yellow">I will see to it. Please leave for the airport right now.</font>

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,400
<font color="yellow">So there's a bullet in his head?</font>

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,730
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's why he got hypnotherapy to relieve the pain.</font>

41
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,000
<font color="yellow">But whenever he thought of you,</font>

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,430
<font color="yellow">he got this severe pain, just like you saw.</font>

43
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,210
<font color="yellow">Can't he get it removed by surgery?</font>

44
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,460
<font color="yellow">It's very dangerous.</font>

45
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,500
<font color="yellow">He may die.</font>

46
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,830
<font color="yellow">What about treatments? Is there any way to deal with it?</font>

47
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,330
<font color="yellow">The man who did the hypnotherapy will be here tonight.</font>

48
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,800
<font color="yellow">He said he'd find other ways to relieve him of his pain,</font>

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
<font color="yellow">so we'll wait and see what he can do.</font>

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,930
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  Here.</font>

51
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,960
<font color="yellow">Take it. It's probably from your awaited customer.</font>

52
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,630
<font color="yellow">Mr Cho.</font>

53
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,200
<font color="yellow">Did you get the vase?</font>

54
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,400
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

55
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,630
<font color="yellow">Now, tell me...</font>

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
<font color="yellow">what I must do.</font>

57
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,500
<font color="yellow">You can announce the resignation of your candidacy,</font>

58
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,460
<font color="yellow">then come over to my office to announce that you support me.</font>

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,560
<font color="yellow">I will do that.</font>

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
<font color="yellow">What about...</font>

61
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,510
<font color="yellow">the promised amount?</font>

62
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,760
<font color="yellow">You can choose either cash or a bearer bond.</font>

63
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,800
<font color="yellow">I think a bearer bond is a safer choice.</font>

64
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,330
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,610
<font color="yellow">My assistant will give you a call early tomorrow.</font>

66
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,860
<font color="yellow">You can discuss the details with my assistant.</font>

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,700
<font color="yellow">Are we about 80 percent there?</font>

68
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,100
<font color="yellow">What will you do for me...</font>

69
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,160
<font color="yellow">if you win this election?</font>

70
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,860
<font color="yellow">Tell me anything...</font>

71
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,460
<font color="yellow">you want.</font>

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,260
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of things that I want from you.</font>

73
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,830
<font color="yellow">Can you really do them all?</font>

74
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,630
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,</font>

75
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,900
<font color="yellow">I'll become the mayor of Seoul.</font>

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,200
<font color="yellow">So what can't I do for you?</font>

77
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,960
<font color="yellow">Here's my first wish.</font>

78
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,830
<font color="yellow">Don't think about anything else,</font>

79
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,100
<font color="yellow">but just drink with me.</font>

80
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,860
<font color="yellow">That would be my pleasure.</font>

82
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,730
<font color="yellow">I must be a bad girl.</font>

83
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,930
<font color="yellow">I really wish...</font>

84
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,030
<font color="yellow">that you wouldn't take this call.</font>

85
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,760
<font color="yellow">Isn't he picking up?</font>

86
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,830
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

87
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,200
<font color="yellow">I heard he left his office late afternoon.</font>

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,060
<font color="yellow">You should keep...</font>

89
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,220
<font color="yellow">an eye on him.</font>

90
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,760
<font color="yellow">It's probably nothing.</font>

91
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,930
<font color="yellow">He can barely sleep at night because of the election.</font>

92
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,330
<font color="yellow">You must pay attention...</font>

93
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,900
<font color="yellow">to what I've said before.</font>

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,060
<font color="yellow">He must not do anything...</font>

95
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,110
<font color="yellow">that will give a handle to his opponents.</font>

96
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,630
<font color="yellow">You couldn't have made it more clear.</font>

97
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's not up to anything stupid.</font>

98
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,460
<font color="yellow">When one is smitten with power,</font>

99
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,860
<font color="yellow">there is nothing else one will care about.</font>

100
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,260
<font color="yellow">I'm his father-in-law. He could easily disregard me.</font>

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,900
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

102
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,560
<font color="yellow">Keep your head straight...</font>

103
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,060
<font color="yellow">and make sure you keep him grounded.</font>

104
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,600
<font color="yellow">If he does anything out of line,</font>

105
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,230
<font color="yellow">I won't...</font>

106
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,430
<font color="yellow">forgive him.</font>

107
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,860
<font color="yellow">Goodnight, Father.</font>

108
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,860
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he picking up his phone?</font>

109
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,000
<font color="yellow">I think I drank too much.</font>

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,930
<font color="yellow">I'm so dizzy.</font>

111
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,230
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung.</font>

112
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,030
<font color="yellow">Keep your distance.</font>

113
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh, Mr Byun.</font>

114
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,930
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun, please wake up.</font>

115
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
<font color="yellow">You're almost home.</font>

116
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,630
<font color="yellow">You're so annoying.</font>

117
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,030
<font color="yellow">Just drive.</font>

118
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,860
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

119
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you drink so much?</font>

120
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
<font color="yellow">It's my wife.</font>

121
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,100
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

122
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,800
<font color="yellow">The election is very near. How can you drink so much?</font>

123
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,730
<font color="yellow">I had to drink because of a great occasion.</font>

124
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,000
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

125
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,600
<font color="yellow">- Take him to his bedroom.
-  Yes, Ma'am.</font>

126
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,760
<font color="yellow">- This way, Sir.
-  All right.</font>

127
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,560
<font color="yellow">I'll get going then.</font>

128
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,930
<font color="yellow">Ms Ok.</font>

129
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
<font color="yellow">Did you drink, too?</font>

130
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,930
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

131
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,730
<font color="yellow">Yes. Just a little.</font>

132
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,900
<font color="yellow">I don't think this is just a little.</font>

133
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,430
<font color="yellow">Were you two alone?</font>

134
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,330
<font color="yellow">Of course not. Why would I drink with Mr Byun?</font>

135
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,460
<font color="yellow">Who else was there?</font>

136
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,400
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Who else was there this late at night?</font>

137
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,130
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

138
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,800
<font color="yellow">He had a meeting with his colleagues.</font>

139
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,400
<font color="yellow">His colleagues?</font>

140
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,030
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

141
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,630
<font color="yellow">She attended to help host the gathering.</font>

142
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,460
<font color="yellow">Everyone drank so well.</font>

143
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,430
<font color="yellow">It was so hard to keep up.</font>

144
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

145
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,170
<font color="yellow">Not at all. I drank too much.</font>

146
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,900
<font color="yellow">You did well today.</font>

147
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,530
<font color="yellow">You should go in and rest.</font>

148
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,010
<font color="yellow">Thank you for helping me.</font>

149
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,030
<font color="yellow">Don't be stupid.</font>

150
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,270
<font color="yellow">I was only looking out for Mr Byun.</font>

151
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,400
<font color="yellow">Either way.</font>

152
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,400
<font color="yellow">No wonder he puts his trust in you.</font>

153
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,360
<font color="yellow">Don't cross the line with him.</font>

154
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,530
<font color="yellow">If they find out that you're up to something,</font>

155
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,330
<font color="yellow">they'll get rid of you without a problem.</font>

156
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,330
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

157
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,730
<font color="yellow">I'll rip this household apart before then.</font>

158
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,200
<font color="yellow">Honey. Take your clothes off.</font>

159
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,930
<font color="yellow">Where on earth did you get this?</font>

160
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,260
<font color="yellow">Thank you for making your way here.</font>

161
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,330
<font color="yellow">Is she the one you mentioned over the phone?</font>

162
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

163
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,570
<font color="yellow">Can you explain to me what happened?</font>

164
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,540
<font color="yellow">This never happened to me before, so I'm surprised myself.</font>

165
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,960
<font color="yellow">Why was the hypnosis lifted?</font>

166
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,160
<font color="yellow">He must have loved Ms Oh enough...</font>

167
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,630
<font color="yellow">to break through the hypnosis.</font>

168
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,260
<font color="yellow">There's no other explanation for it.</font>

169
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,640
<font color="yellow">Can he be treated?</font>

170
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,100
<font color="yellow">We can get rid of his pain altogether,</font>

171
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,080
<font color="yellow">but if that happens,</font>

172
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,460
<font color="yellow">he will also forget everything related to you.</font>

173
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,160
<font color="yellow">Can't we revive his memories...</font>

174
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,900
<font color="yellow">about Soo Yeon later on?</font>

175
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,930
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to find a solution for it,</font>

176
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,330
<font color="yellow">but I can't guarantee when I'll find it.</font>

177
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,000
<font color="yellow">Please erase...</font>

178
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,560
<font color="yellow">any memories of me in him.</font>

179
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,610
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

180
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,000
<font color="yellow">Please heal him so that he won't ever be in pain...</font>

181
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,630
<font color="yellow">because of me.</font>

182
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,900
<font color="yellow">I beg you.</font>

183
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,730
<font color="yellow">What do you see right now?</font>

184
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,030
<font color="yellow">I see...</font>

185
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,960
<font color="yellow">a beautiful house I've always dreamed of.</font>

186
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,360
<font color="yellow">Who came out from that house?</font>

187
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,430
<font color="yellow">Brother!</font>

188
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo.</font>

189
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,730
<font color="yellow">It's Guk Cheol. Hello.</font>

190
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,930
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo came out.</font>

191
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,900
<font color="yellow">He welcomed me with a smile.</font>

192
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,800
<font color="yellow">What did you do after that?</font>

193
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,230
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

194
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,030
<font color="yellow">going inside that house.</font>

195
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,800
<font color="yellow">There's a woman waiting for me.</font>

196
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,500
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

197
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,030
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

198
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,100
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

199
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,100
<font color="yellow">Oh Soo Yeon...</font>

200
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,700
<font color="yellow">It's the woman I love.</font>

201
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,230
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy...</font>

202
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,600
<font color="yellow">I wish time would stop right now.</font>

203
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,730
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

204
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,260
<font color="yellow">you will enter that house again.</font>

205
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,400
<font color="yellow">You will look in every corner,</font>

206
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,560
<font color="yellow">but no one...</font>

207
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,100
<font color="yellow">is in that empty house.</font>

208
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,830
<font color="yellow">Your memory...</font>

209
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,830
<font color="yellow">is an illusion the bullet in your head made up.</font>

210
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,830
<font color="yellow">There's not a single memory...</font>

211
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,760
<font color="yellow">of Oh Soo Yeon left in your head.</font>

212
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,600
<font color="yellow">All of the things that caused you pain...</font>

213
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,330
<font color="yellow">will be gone forever.</font>

214
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,430
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

215
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,460
<font color="yellow">you're at ease.</font>

216

217
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,300

218
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,900
<font color="yellow">Don't try to remember me.</font>

219
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,030
<font color="yellow">I won't be greedy any more.</font>

220
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,330
<font color="yellow">I'm just so thankful that you're alive.</font>

228
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,160
<font color="yellow">These are some internal documents from Il Jae's company.</font>

<font color="yellow">I won't think about anything else.</font>

241
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,670
<font color="yellow">What do you think about her?</font>

242
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,830
<font color="yellow">She looks like a nice person.</font>

243
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,500
<font color="yellow">She has a great face.</font>

244

<font color="yellow">She's the daughter of Chairman Kang from Woojung Group.</font>

245
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,270
<font color="yellow">Isn't Chairman Kang's son the son-in-law of the president?</font>

246
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,760
<font color="yellow">His company is not very big, but their family is powerful...</font>

<font color="yellow">The fact that he was born outside of marriage...</font>

254
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,830
<font color="yellow">I know Chairman Kang well.</font>

255

<font color="yellow">After the general meeting,</font>

256
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,060
<font color="yellow">I'll announce Gun Woo as my successor.</font>

257
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,530
<font color="yellow">Then they won't turn down the marriage.</font>

258
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,730

259

<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what's wrong. I've been taking my medicine.</font>

260
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,660
<font color="yellow">I think you've worked out too much recently.</font>

<font color="yellow">Here's your pills.</font>

262
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,560
<font color="yellow">Here you are.</font>

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,810
<font color="yellow">Engagement?</font>

264
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,380
<font color="yellow">Why suddenly?</font>

265
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,820
<font color="yellow">Your father is dying to arrange a marriage for him.</font>

266
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,030
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

267
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,000
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to arrange one for me?</font>

268
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,940
<font color="yellow">No way. I'll never get into an arranged marriage.</font>

269
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,000
<font color="yellow">Shin Young, the company is about to go into Gun Woo's hands.</font>

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,660
<font color="yellow">You should play along.</font>

271
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,930
<font color="yellow">You can do it, then.</font>

272
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,300
<font color="yellow">He will. He's marrying Seogang Group's second daughter.</font>

273
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,000
<font color="yellow">No way, I don't want to.</font>

274
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,830
<font color="yellow">I won't get married twice.</font>

275
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,060
<font color="yellow">Are you two serious? This isn't all for me.</font>

276
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,990
<font color="yellow">It's all for your future.</font>

277
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,690
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I'm not doing it.</font>

278
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,700
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

279
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,530
<font color="yellow">Do you like Chairman K?</font>

280
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,870
<font color="yellow">Chairman K?</font>

281
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,300
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Gi Tan, who came back as a huge businessman?</font>

282
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,530
<font color="yellow">Yes, I heard from the hotel manager...</font>

283
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,130
<font color="yellow">that she is crazy for him.</font>

284
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,660
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I'm not crazy about anyone.</font>

285
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,260
<font color="yellow">I'm having such a hard time because he's dying to get me.</font>

286
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

287
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,870
<font color="yellow">Is Gi Tan crazy for you?</font>

288
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,800
<font color="yellow">It's awful. He's been dying to go on a date with me.</font>

289
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,060
<font color="yellow">That's even better.</font>

290
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,330
<font color="yellow">You should definitely go for him.</font>

291
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,670
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

292
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,760
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

293
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,630
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to get married to him?</font>

294
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,700
<font color="yellow">You don't have to marry him.</font>

295
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,570
<font color="yellow">Just announce an engagement just before the general meeting.</font>

296
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,820
<font color="yellow">That will help you get the shareholders' trust.</font>

297
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,830
<font color="yellow">But I'm sure he's already feeling pretty down...</font>

298
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,730
<font color="yellow">because I've been really bad to him.</font>

299
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,400
<font color="yellow">That's weird.</font>

300
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,430
<font color="yellow">What I've heard was that you're all crazy for him,</font>

301
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,990
<font color="yellow">but he doesn't want anything to do with you.</font>

302
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you know anything about her?</font>

303
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,550
<font color="yellow">She's not someone who'd go crazy for anyone.</font>

304
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,560
<font color="yellow">Mum, that's what I thought, but...</font>

305
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,960
<font color="yellow">Shut it. You don't know anything.</font>

306
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,870
<font color="yellow">Anyways.</font>

307
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,660
<font color="yellow">I will set up a meeting for you and Gi Tan.</font>

308
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
<font color="yellow">You should make up with him.</font>

309
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,800
<font color="yellow">You can do that, right?</font>

310
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,000
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

311
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,500
<font color="yellow">Don't mention this to him, okay?</font>

312
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,810
<font color="yellow">He's not the man he was before.</font>

313
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,500
<font color="yellow">Stop playing hard to get and just date him.</font>

314
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,600
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

315
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,900
<font color="yellow">My work is already straining enough. Don't ever call me about this again.</font>

316
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,900
<font color="yellow">At least go on a blind date!</font>

317
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
<font color="yellow">Kang Gi Tan.</font>

318
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,260
<font color="yellow">Why don't you also get married again, Sir?</font>

319
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,690
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Mr Han.</font>

320
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,800
<font color="yellow">I think it would be useful to become the successor.</font>

321
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,600
<font color="yellow">I think I am very sick.</font>

322
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,260
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

323
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,730
<font color="yellow">Well, it's that...</font>

324
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,730
<font color="yellow">Whenever I hear about engagements and marriages,</font>

325
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,900
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon's face always magically appears...</font>

326
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,430
<font color="yellow">inside my head.</font>

327
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,000
<font color="yellow">Like this!</font>

328
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,660
<font color="yellow">Oh, Soo Yeon.</font>

329
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,550
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

330
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,680
<font color="yellow">You should at least say hello when you meet someone you know.</font>

331
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,500
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit busy right now.</font>

332
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait.</font>

333
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,030
<font color="yellow">Why don't you and I go over there...</font>

334
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
<font color="yellow">and talk?</font>

335
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,600
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

336
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,500
<font color="yellow">You told me...</font>

337
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,700
<font color="yellow">last time that there is someone you love.</font>

338
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,300
<font color="yellow">I gave that a thought, and I think...</font>

339
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,460
<font color="yellow">you were lying.</font>

340
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it's not Gun Woo because he's Il Jae's man.</font>

341
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,460
<font color="yellow">Who could it be?</font>

342
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,530
<font color="yellow">You can tell me.</font>

343
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,590
<font color="yellow">See? You can't.</font>

344
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,800
<font color="yellow">I never got good grades, but I catch onto things quickly.</font>

345
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,700
<font color="yellow">- So what?
-  Why do you ask?</font>

346
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,580
<font color="yellow">I already...</font>

347
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,300
<font color="yellow">told you how I feel.</font>

348
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,330
<font color="yellow">You said you were betrayed by me twice.</font>

349
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,030
<font color="yellow">What if I betray you again?</font>

350
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,100
<font color="yellow">I will probably go insane.</font>

351
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,660
<font color="yellow">That's my answer.</font>

352
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,700
<font color="yellow">Don't ever make me hear this nonsense again.</font>

353
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,730
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

354
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,830
<font color="yellow">Date me just for a year.</font>

355
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

356
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,930
<font color="yellow">Let's date seriously for three months.</font>

357
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,570
<font color="yellow">Hey, CEO Do.</font>

358
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,920
<font color="yellow">I will be really good to you.</font>

359
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,600
<font color="yellow">I will make you feel loved.</font>

360
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,940
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

361
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,000
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

362
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

363
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,660
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

364
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,590
<font color="yellow">I had to talk to her about some business...</font>

365
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,700
<font color="yellow">He asked me to marry him.</font>

366
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,660
<font color="yellow">What a big mouth you have!</font>

367
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,330
<font color="yellow">Did you think I would keep this nonsense a secret?</font>

368
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,930
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim,</font>

369
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,530
<font color="yellow">take Lawyer Oh to my office.</font>

370
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,760
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir. This way, please.</font>

371
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,970
<font color="yellow">How much lower will you get?</font>

372
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

373
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,130
<font color="yellow">- Lower?
-  I will let it pass for today.</font>

374
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,500
<font color="yellow">But don't say anything stupid to Soo Yeon ever again.</font>

375
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,050
<font color="yellow">Hey, why do you care about whatever I do?</font>

376
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,330
<font color="yellow">Is she yours?</font>

377
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,960
<font color="yellow">Yes. She's mine.</font>

378
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

379
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,730
<font color="yellow">I love her.</font>

380
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,460
<font color="yellow">So don't come near her.</font>

381
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,200
<font color="yellow">This is my final warning.</font>

382
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

383
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,060
<font color="yellow">Did you hear him?</font>

384
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,130
<font color="yellow">He said Soo Yeon is his.</font>

385
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,080
<font color="yellow">I don't think Soo Yeon is right for you either.</font>

386
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,260
<font color="yellow">What if Chairwoman Hwang finds out?</font>

387
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,200
<font color="yellow">I am not giving up.</font>

388
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,820
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

389
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,500
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo likes her, too. I won't let him have her...</font>

390
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,860
<font color="yellow">even if I have to break up with her later.</font>

391
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

392
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

393
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
<font color="yellow">the real war begins.</font>

394
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,170
<font color="yellow">Get the head of SPD...</font>

395
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,200
<font color="yellow">and ask what those two have been up to these days.</font>

396
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,500
<font color="yellow">Do it.</font>

397
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,960
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I can't believe I'm still embarrassed.</font>

398
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you hiding?</font>

399
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,930
<font color="yellow">I wasn't hiding.</font>

400
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,030
<font color="yellow">No one ever cleans up around here.</font>

401
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
<font color="yellow">This is so dirty.</font>

402
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,860
<font color="yellow">Next week, Chinese shipowners are coming.</font>

403
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,100
<font color="yellow">They'll stay at this hotel,</font>

404
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,810
<font color="yellow">so please redo the interior and make sure...</font>

405
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,570
<font color="yellow">all the home appliances work.</font>

406
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,700
<font color="yellow">Make sure they get personalised meals, too.</font>

407
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
<font color="yellow">What else?</font>

408
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,200
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything else to say?</font>

409
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,900
<font color="yellow">We're still dating, you know.</font>

410
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,260
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

411
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,400
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I went through because of you?</font>

412
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,810
<font color="yellow">Kang Ga Din!</font>

413
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,030
<font color="yellow">Run! Run faster!</font>

414
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,260
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

415
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,000
<font color="yellow">No, I don't remember.</font>

416
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,180
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

417
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,430
<font color="yellow">I never knew anyone could behave so indecently when they were drunk.</font>

418
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,830
<font color="yellow">Indecently?</font>

419
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,070
<font color="yellow">I'll let this pass because I don't remember it.</font>

420
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,530
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd given up on dating me that day.</font>

421
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,500
<font color="yellow">I thought that's why you behaved the way you did.</font>

422
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,660
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

423
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,860
<font color="yellow">I remember now.</font>

424
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,000
<font color="yellow">It was because you were an awful person to date.</font>

425
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

426
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,060
<font color="yellow">We can only talk about business from now on.</font>

427
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

428
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mum. I will go on that blind date.</font>

429
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,660
<font color="yellow">Find someone who is much better than Gi Tan.</font>

430
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
<font color="yellow">Kang Ga Din.</font>

431
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,930
<font color="yellow">I will find someone who's so much better than you...</font>

432
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,030
<font color="yellow">and I'll make you regret this.</font>

433
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
<font color="yellow">You just wait and see.</font>

434
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,800
<font color="yellow">I resign...</font>

435
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,200
<font color="yellow">as the candidate for the mayor of Seoul.</font>

436
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
<font color="yellow">And I officially support...</font>

437
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,830
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae from now on.</font>

438
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,840
<font color="yellow">At today's press conference, Candidate Cho stated that...</font>

439
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,530
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae is the candidate...</font>

440
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,200
<font color="yellow">that he thinks is the most ideal person for the mayor position.</font>

441
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,400
<font color="yellow">What if Il Jae actually becomes the mayor?</font>

442
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,770
<font color="yellow">Don't even say that.</font>

443
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,930
<font color="yellow">It'll be trouble if he becomes the mayor of Seoul.</font>

444
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,130
<font color="yellow">They just said that he's the most ideal candidate.</font>

445
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,560
<font color="yellow">We're the only ones who know what he's really like.</font>

446
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,560
<font color="yellow">There's no way he'll become the mayor.</font>

447
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,800
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure he doesn't make it.</font>

448
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,030
<font color="yellow">With the support from candidate Cho Cham,</font>

449
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,430
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae will have a foot ahead in the race...</font>

450
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,330
<font color="yellow">whilst the candidates are narrowing down.</font>

451
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,930
<font color="yellow">The bait I mentioned before is Cho Cham.</font>

452
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,200
<font color="yellow">Il Jae took a bite...</font>

453
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,930
<font color="yellow">like a dumb goldfish.</font>

454
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,060
<font color="yellow">Do you have proof that Il Jae bribed him?</font>

455
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,160
<font color="yellow">They haven't given him any money yet.</font>

456
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,730
<font color="yellow">I'll be there when they move...</font>

457
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,760
<font color="yellow">to get the evidence. You don't have to worry about it.</font>

458
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,200
<font color="yellow">Call Lawyer Oh.</font>

459
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,800
<font color="yellow">Why do you suddenly need her for?</font>

460
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,870
<font color="yellow">Television is the most effective medium...</font>

461
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,560
<font color="yellow">to reveal Il Jae's corruption.</font>

462
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,660
<font color="yellow">We should prepare in advance.</font>

463
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,660
<font color="yellow">Will you be all right?</font>

464
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,760
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem?</font>

465
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,930
<font color="yellow">Do you remember seeing Lawyer Oh...</font>

466
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,830
<font color="yellow">two days ago?</font>

467
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,800
<font color="yellow">I had a huge headache, so we didn't get to talk much.</font>

468
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,230
<font color="yellow">Do you remember seeing her faint on the streets?</font>

469
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,010
<font color="yellow">We moved her to the hospital...</font>

470
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,430
<font color="yellow">and informed Gun Woo.</font>

471
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,700
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep asking me?</font>

472
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,530
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I thought you might've forgotten due to the treatment.</font>

473
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,930
<font color="yellow">Call her and ask her for lunch.</font>

474
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,630
<font color="yellow">If she's busy, ask if dinner works.</font>

475
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

476
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,560
<font color="yellow">(Lawyer Oh Soo Yeon)</font>

477
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,930
<font color="yellow">B World is probably under the suspicion of dodging taxes.</font>

478
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,630
<font color="yellow">I'll look for materials in that matter.</font>

479
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,300
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

480
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,700
<font color="yellow">Yes, Soo Tak.</font>

481
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,560
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

482
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,200
<font color="yellow">No, I'm free.</font>

483
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,860
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

484
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,600
<font color="yellow">Who was that?</font>

485
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,130
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan wants to see me to talk about business.</font>

486
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,100
<font color="yellow">Will it be all right?</font>

487
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,730
<font color="yellow">According to Soo Tak, his hypnotherapy went well,</font>

488
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,000
<font color="yellow">so it should be all right.</font>

489
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,960
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about him. I'm asking about you.</font>

490
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,660
<font color="yellow">Can you act like you don't know him?</font>

491
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,960
<font color="yellow">I have to.</font>

492
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,530
<font color="yellow">I think I can do it.</font>

493
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,360
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

494
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

495
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,700
<font color="yellow">It's nice to finally meet you.</font>

496
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,600
<font color="yellow">I'm Kang Gi Tan.</font>

497
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,830
<font color="yellow">I'm Lawyer Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

498
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,260
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

499
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,830
<font color="yellow">Please take a seat.</font>

500
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,460
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

501
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,330
<font color="yellow">I heard a lot about you.</font>

502
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,360
<font color="yellow">I heard your brother...</font>

503
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,160
<font color="yellow">passed away because of Il Jae.</font>

504
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,360
<font color="yellow">I also heard that you have a grudge against him.</font>

505
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,630
<font color="yellow">Is there a way to get revenge at him?</font>

506
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,330
<font color="yellow">I'm certain that...</font>

507
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,260
<font color="yellow">illegal funds have been involved during his campaign.</font>

508
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,450
<font color="yellow">I intend on researching Il Jae's company, B World,</font>

509
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,330
<font color="yellow">on embezzlement of public funds.</font>

510
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,330
<font color="yellow">We're tracking any illegal activities with his campaign.</font>

511
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,730
<font color="yellow">When the time comes, we would like to disclose it on your show.</font>

512
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,660
<font color="yellow">There's no reason for me to decline.</font>

513
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,860
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm meeting an old friend.</font>

514
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we'll have to help each other out a lot.</font>

515
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,460
<font color="yellow">I'm also glad to have met you as well.</font>

516
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,660
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

517
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,700
<font color="yellow">Their course meals are great.</font>

518
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,770
<font color="yellow">I have another meeting to go to.</font>

519
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

520
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,330
<font color="yellow">We'll do it another time then.</font>

521
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,960
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

522
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,360
<font color="yellow">I'm back, Mr Hwang.</font>

523
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,430
<font color="yellow">Why is Cho Cham...</font>

524
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,130
<font color="yellow">supporting you instead of running for himself?</font>

525
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,860
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see the press conference?</font>

526
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,660
<font color="yellow">I thought I warned you.</font>

527
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,330
<font color="yellow">You must not cheat this time.</font>

528
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,560
<font color="yellow">What have you done to him?</font>

529
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,160
<font color="yellow">Honey, go to our room.</font>

530
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,530
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
-  Go inside.</font>

531
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,130
<font color="yellow">You're the one...</font>

532
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,160
<font color="yellow">who cheated to turn this election into a mess.</font>

533
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,130
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
-  Did you think...</font>

534
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,660
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't know that you organised the attack on Ji Soo?</font>

535
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,770
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

536
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,030
<font color="yellow">You probably aimed for me at first.</font>

537
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,700
<font color="yellow">Then Ji Soo accidentally got hurt in my place.</font>

538
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,800
<font color="yellow">If you can't solve it,</font>

539
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,360
<font color="yellow">then that becomes cheating.</font>

540
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,960
<font color="yellow">That incident will never be revealed to the world.</font>

541
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,300
<font color="yellow">However, what you've done...</font>

542
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,660
<font color="yellow">It will be completely buried.</font>

543
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,900
<font color="yellow">I'm capable of doing that.</font>

544
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,660
<font color="yellow">When I become the mayor of Seoul,</font>

545
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,960
<font color="yellow">I'll use all my power...</font>

546
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,960
<font color="yellow">to support you in the presidential election.</font>

547
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,770
<font color="yellow">Put your trust in me for the last time.</font>

548
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,130
<font color="yellow">It's already too late.</font>

549
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,600
<font color="yellow">He's confident about this.</font>

550
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,600
<font color="yellow">We have no choice but to trust in him.</font>

551
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,230
<font color="yellow">Il Jae...</font>

552
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,060
<font color="yellow">I'm not doubting his capability.</font>

553
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,270
<font color="yellow">It's Gi Tan.</font>

554
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,900
<font color="yellow">He's a scary man.</font>

555
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,360
<font color="yellow">It's him that worries me.</font>

556
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,830
<font color="yellow">If...</font>

557
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,560
<font color="yellow">things turn out the way you're worried about,</font>

558
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,560
<font color="yellow">what will you do?</font>

559
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,770
<font color="yellow">Then it'll be over between ll Jae and me.</font>

560
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,160
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if he's my son-in-law.</font>

561
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,900
<font color="yellow">- Tonight?
-  Yes.</font>

562
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,110
<font color="yellow">Mr Cho will be visiting the antique store tonight.</font>

563
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,860
<font color="yellow">Is the owner of that store trustworthy?</font>

564
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,200
<font color="yellow">I've been working with them for years. You don't have to worry.</font>

565
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,270
<font color="yellow">What about the money?</font>

566
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,530
<font color="yellow">When he brings in the vase, Il Jae will give me the money.</font>

567
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,060
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the money once I get it.</font>

568
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,900
<font color="yellow">Our hunt for Il Jae is finally starting.</font>

569
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,270
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

570
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,300
<font color="yellow">I came to sell something.</font>

571
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,300
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look.</font>

572
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,860
<font color="yellow">It's worth 2.5 million dollars.</font>

573
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,270
<font color="yellow">You want it in a bearer bond, right?</font>

574
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

575
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,430
<font color="yellow">If you write down your contact, I'll send someone over to you.</font>

576
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
<font color="yellow">Is this all you need?</font>

577
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

578
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. You can go now.</font>

579
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,100
<font color="yellow">Great work.</font>

580
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,240
<font color="yellow">Here's a little something for you.</font>

581
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,330
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

582
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,460
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong, deny everything.</font>

583
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,960
<font color="yellow">You'll be fine since there's no proof.</font>

584
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,130
<font color="yellow">Cho Cham just sold the vase.</font>

585
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,860
<font color="yellow">Do you have the money?</font>

586
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,330
<font color="yellow">(10,000 dollars)</font>

587
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,810
<font color="yellow">Who will give him the money?</font>

588
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,100
<font color="yellow">The owner of the antique store.</font>

589
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,560
<font color="yellow">That way, no one can trace the money back to us.</font>

590
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,360
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

591
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,200
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

592
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,430
<font color="yellow">Follow her.</font>

593
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,860
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

594
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,930
<font color="yellow">Follow her and see if she gives the money...</font>

595
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,100
<font color="yellow">to the store owner.</font>

596
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,530
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

597
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,230
<font color="yellow">(Moon Tae Gwang)</font>

598
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,300
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Moon. I'm on the way.</font>

599
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,500
<font color="yellow">You're being followed.</font>

600
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,460
<font color="yellow">I came just in case. I'm glad I did.</font>

601
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,530
<font color="yellow">Let's not meet right now.</font>

602
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,830
<font color="yellow">You just saved my life.</font>

603
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,300
<font color="yellow">I used to work at the NIS.</font>

604
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,230
<font color="yellow">What will you do now?</font>

605
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,290
<font color="yellow">I'll go to Insa-dong.</font>

606
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,730
<font color="yellow">Pick up the money there.</font>

607
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,100
<font color="yellow">We're closed for...</font>

608
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

609
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,530
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon will come by later.</font>

610
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,830
<font color="yellow">Give him this suitcase.</font>

611
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

612
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,130
<font color="yellow">It's me, Sir.</font>

613
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,630
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry about her.</font>

614
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,230
<font color="yellow">I didn't think Il Jae still doubted me.</font>

615
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,580
<font color="yellow">You should quit...</font>

616
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,230
<font color="yellow">and move out soon.</font>

617
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,230
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

618
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,330
<font color="yellow">I think I should be more proactive.</font>

619
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,630
<font color="yellow">Even if he isn't elected this time,</font>

620
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,600
<font color="yellow">he won't go down that easily...</font>

621
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,530
<font color="yellow">as long as his wife and father-in-law are around.</font>

622
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,630
<font color="yellow">We started this.</font>

623
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,230
<font color="yellow">Let's finish it.</font>

624
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,770
<font color="yellow">I have something for you.</font>

625
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,230
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

626
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,380
<font color="yellow">Were you followed?</font>

627
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,430
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

628
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,560
<font color="yellow">How much was it?</font>

629
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,960
<font color="yellow">2.5 million dollars.</font>

630
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
<font color="yellow">2.5 million?</font>

631
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,000
<font color="yellow">That's odd.</font>

632
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,460
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun said two million.</font>

633
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,900
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun promised me 2.5 million dollars.</font>

634
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,100
<font color="yellow">Would I quit campaigning for any less than that?</font>

635
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,760
<font color="yellow">Well... Maybe I was mistaken.</font>

636
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,430
<font color="yellow">Here. Check the amount yourself.</font>

637
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,180
<font color="yellow">Is it correct?</font>

638
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,110
<font color="yellow">2.5 million. It's all here.</font>

639
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I guess I misheard.</font>

640
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,230
<font color="yellow">It's a large sum. Where will you keep it?</font>

641
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:48,360
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask that?</font>

642
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,100
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun is afraid something could go wrong.</font>

643
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,960
<font color="yellow">I won't spend it for a while.</font>

644
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,500
<font color="yellow">I'll put it in a safe deposit box.</font>

645
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,230
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

646
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:18,410
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun promised me 2.5 million dollars.</font>

647
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,760
<font color="yellow">Would I quit campaigning for any less than that?</font>

648
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,730
<font color="yellow">I won't spend it for a while.</font>

649
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,600
<font color="yellow">I'll put it in a safe deposit box.</font>

650
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,600
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

651
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,290
<font color="yellow">This recording shows who gave whom how much...</font>

652
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,400
<font color="yellow">to do what.</font>

653
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:36,730
<font color="yellow">The election...</font>

654
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,330
<font color="yellow">is no longer a worry.</font>

655
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,360
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

656
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,310
<font color="yellow">When will you release this?</font>

657
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,370
<font color="yellow">Let's see how the voting goes.</font>

658
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,400
<font color="yellow">I'll release it...</font>

659
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,830
<font color="yellow">if Il Jae is voted.</font>

660
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,930
<font color="yellow">It hurts more...</font>

661
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,400
<font color="yellow">to fall from the 10th floor than the 2nd.</font>

662
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,130
<font color="yellow">Do I have...</font>

663
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,000
<font color="yellow">some land in Yongin?</font>

664
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,930
<font color="yellow">Yes. You bought it years ago.</font>

665
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,560
<font color="yellow">The price has risen a lot.</font>

666
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,400
<font color="yellow">Did you look for a way...</font>

667
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:18,010
<font color="yellow">to get back what I gave my wife and Gwang Woo?</font>

668
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,010
<font color="yellow">I'm studying the relative laws.</font>

669
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,130
<font color="yellow">Find a way before the shareholder meeting.</font>

670
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:23,930
<font color="yellow">I want...</font>

671
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,330
<font color="yellow">to make sure they end up penniless.</font>

672
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

673
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:35,000
<font color="yellow">You look very tired.</font>

674
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,030
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

675
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,030
<font color="yellow">When am I meeting Gun Woo for lunch?</font>

676
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,030
<font color="yellow">You have to leave now, Sir.</font>

677
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,700
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

678
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,860
<font color="yellow">Join us.</font>

679
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,230
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

680
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,740
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

681
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,400
<font color="yellow">Knock before you come in, woman!</font>

682
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,200
<font color="yellow">Are you that ignorant?</font>

683
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:01,590
<font color="yellow">Do you insult me in front of others because you're educated?</font>

684
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:02,730
<font color="yellow">I'd do anything...</font>

685
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,330
<font color="yellow">not to see your face for one whole day!</font>

686
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:21,730
<font color="yellow">Three, four.</font>

687
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,830
<font color="yellow">One bottle's gone already.</font>

688
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,560
<font color="yellow">He should be feeling the symptoms.</font>

689
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
<font color="yellow">- Give me that.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

690
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:46,930
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

691
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,330
<font color="yellow">Look inside.</font>

692
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,330
<font color="yellow">It's the daughter of Woojung Group's Chairman Kang.</font>

693
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,130
<font color="yellow">See if you'd like to marry her.</font>

694
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,530
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Father.</font>

695
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,130
<font color="yellow">I don't want to get married yet.</font>

696
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,330
<font color="yellow">Marriage isn't about what you want.</font>

697
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,120
<font color="yellow">It's all about timing.</font>

698
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,470
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

699
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,330
<font color="yellow">Right now, you need to get married.</font>

700
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:21,230
<font color="yellow">I know what's best for you. Do as I say.</font>

701
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,100
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

702
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,630
<font color="yellow">To the men's room.</font>

703
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,030
<font color="yellow">- Sir! Sir!
-  Father!</font>

704
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,030
<font color="yellow">- Sir! Sir!
-  Father!</font>

705
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,930
<font color="yellow">Call 911, now!</font>

706
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:43,830
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

707
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,760
<font color="yellow">- 150. Charged.
-  Clear.</font>

708
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,360
<font color="yellow">Once more.</font>

709
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,230
<font color="yellow">- Charged.
-  1, 2.</font>

710
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,330
<font color="yellow">- 200.
-  200.</font>

711
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:16,030
<font color="yellow">How is he?</font>

712
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,060
<font color="yellow">He just woke up.</font>

713
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,260
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

714
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,430
<font color="yellow">He takes his medicine every day...</font>

715
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,130
<font color="yellow">and exercises, too.</font>

716
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,100
<font color="yellow">He was getting better.</font>

717
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,430
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

718
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,930
<font color="yellow">His condition went downhill fast over the last few days.</font>

719
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,630
<font color="yellow">(Wife)</font>

720
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,200
<font color="yellow">It's the chairman's phone.</font>

721
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,380
<font color="yellow">His wife's calling.</font>

722
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,530
<font color="yellow">I'll take it.</font>

723
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,930
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

724
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,230
<font color="yellow">Why are you picking up?</font>

725
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,030
<font color="yellow">Put your father on.</font>

726
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,160
<font color="yellow">He went outside for a moment.</font>

727
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,600
<font color="yellow">Outside? Where?</font>

728
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,930
<font color="yellow">Did your father collapse?</font>

729
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,060
<font color="yellow">He was making good progress.</font>

730
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,030
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that?</font>

731
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,760
<font color="yellow">It's obvious.</font>

732
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,060
<font color="yellow">He's always grasping the back of his neck.</font>

733
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,800
<font color="yellow">Where is he that he'd leave his phone behind?</font>

734
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,900
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

735
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,900
<font color="yellow">- How is he?
-  Take him to the ward.</font>

736
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,530
<font color="yellow">Sir. Sir.</font>

737
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,860
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

738
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,860
<font color="yellow">The pills...</font>

739
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,330
<font color="yellow">finally did their job.</font>

740
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,300
<font color="yellow">It could've ended very badly if he got here any later.</font>

741
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,800
<font color="yellow">Dr Hwang, I want you to run a thorough blood test.</font>

742
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,230
<font color="yellow">Do you have his blood pressure medication?</font>

743
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,200
<font color="yellow">I always keep a bottle on me.</font>

744
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:21,700
<font color="yellow">Test these pills, too.</font>

745
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,860
<font color="yellow">I prescribed him these. There shouldn't be a problem.</font>

746
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,730
<font color="yellow">It's odd how he suddenly deteriorated.</font>

747
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,700
<font color="yellow">We'll keep him here for a while. Please run all the necessary tests.</font>

748
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,030
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

749
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,660
<font color="yellow">(Kang Gi Tan)</font>

750
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,030
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh speaking.</font>

751
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,500
<font color="yellow">I have something urgent to discuss. Can we meet?</font>

752
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,930
<font color="yellow">- Where should I go?
-  Come to Dodo Hotel.</font>

753
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,530
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be right there.</font>

754
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,000
<font color="yellow">The chief secretary called me.</font>

755
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,900
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo gave the files on B World to Soo Yeon.</font>

756
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:27,430
<font color="yellow">What does that imply?</font>

757
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,930
<font color="yellow">Doesn't that mean Gun Woo betrayed Il Jae for Soo Yeon?</font>

758
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,230
<font color="yellow">I think that's what happened.</font>

759
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,630
<font color="yellow">If Gun Woo lost his greatest support,</font>

760
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,000
<font color="yellow">this shareholder meeting will be quite the surprise.</font>

761
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,000
<font color="yellow">- Good job.
-  Good job.</font>

762
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,030
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Thank you.</font>

763
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,930
<font color="yellow">- Fight on.
-  Fight on.</font>

764
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,530
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

765
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,330
<font color="yellow">You must be excited.</font>

766
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,630
<font color="yellow">Your approval rating is through the roof.</font>

767
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,840
<font color="yellow">Are you here to see me?</font>

768
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,930
<font color="yellow">But your approval rating isn't the real issue.</font>

769
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,430
<font color="yellow">You might end up in prison...</font>

770
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,000
<font color="yellow">instead of your new office.</font>

771
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,830
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

772
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,200
<font color="yellow">We need...</font>

773
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,200
<font color="yellow">to talk in private.</font>

774
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:45,260
<font color="yellow">Do you know that Gun Woo's trying to get our father reinstated?</font>

775
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:51,130
<font color="yellow">I need you to support my mum instead.</font>

776
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,930
<font color="yellow">You're on the board.</font>

777
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,930
<font color="yellow">You have a lot of influence.</font>

778
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,760
<font color="yellow">Did you ask to see me to talk about that?</font>

779
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,000
<font color="yellow">I was hoping you'd promise so I could go from there.</font>

780
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,930
<font color="yellow">You know how things work.</font>

781
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,430
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you know first.</font>

782
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,700
<font color="yellow">Do you know that Gun Woo gave confidential information...</font>

783
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,900
<font color="yellow">on your company to Soo Yeon?</font>

784
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,530
<font color="yellow">Why would she need it?</font>

785
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,600
<font color="yellow">She wants to track your funds.</font>

786
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,400
<font color="yellow">To put you behind bars.</font>

787
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,510
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to believe you?</font>

788
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,330
<font color="yellow">Too bad if you don't.</font>

789
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,500
<font color="yellow">You go down, not me.</font>

790
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:40,100
<font color="yellow">I just don't get it.</font>

791
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,930
<font color="yellow">Why do you trust Gun Woo?</font>

792
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,860
<font color="yellow">Am I worth less than him to your political career?</font>

793
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,800
<font color="yellow">I get your point. You can go.</font>

794
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,500
<font color="yellow">Give up on him and side with me.</font>

795
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
<font color="yellow">My mother's a much better bet...</font>

796
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,230
<font color="yellow">than my father.</font>

797
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,260
<font color="yellow">I said I got it!</font>

798
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,100
<font color="yellow">Then I'll assume we have a deal.</font>

799
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,930
<font color="yellow">Give me a call.</font>

800
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,730
<font color="yellow">Find out where Soo Yeon is.</font>

801
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

802
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,800
<font color="yellow">I won't spend it for a while.</font>

803
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,430
<font color="yellow">I'll put it in a safe deposit box.</font>

804
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,330
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

805
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,760
<font color="yellow">We will play this recording...</font>

806
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,200
<font color="yellow">on your show.</font>

807
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,530
<font color="yellow">Even if we stop him from becoming mayor,</font>

808
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,600
<font color="yellow">he'll get off with probation or a fine at most.</font>

809
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,200
<font color="yellow">That's not good enough for you.</font>

810
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,830
<font color="yellow">It's nothing compared to...</font>

811
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,430
<font color="yellow">what he did.</font>

812
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,930
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

813
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:59,320
<font color="yellow">Do you have any evidence on the murder...</font>

814
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,530
<font color="yellow">of your brother?</font>

815
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,130
<font color="yellow">The doctor who did the autopsy...</font>

816
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,760
<font color="yellow">left the country.</font>

817
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,730
<font color="yellow">Give us his details.</font>

818
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,430
<font color="yellow">We'll look for him.</font>

819
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,700
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  For now,</font>

820
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,030
<font color="yellow">let's focus on the election.</font>

821
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,630
<font color="yellow">Will you have someone call the show to report this like last time?</font>

822
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,630
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

823
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,160
<font color="yellow">This time, I'll make the call myself.</font>

824
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,060
<font color="yellow">I'll mention how he embezzled from B World.</font>

825
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:58,900
<font color="yellow">See you soon.</font>

826
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,530
<font color="yellow">Call me any time.</font>

827
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:29,930
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

828
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,200
<font color="yellow">I think Gwang Woo told the truth.</font>

829
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,030
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo...</font>

830
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,160
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

831
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:08,600
<font color="yellow">- I'll turn on the light.
-  Don't.</font>

832
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,530
<font color="yellow">Leave it off.</font>

833
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,830
<font color="yellow">I can't stand it that...</font>

834
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,030
<font color="yellow">two people half my age...</font>

835
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,160
<font color="yellow">are trying...</font>

836
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,430
<font color="yellow">to ruin my whole life.</font>

837
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,760
<font color="yellow">I was looking for a way...</font>

838
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:32,860
<font color="yellow">to vent my frustration and fury.</font>

839
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,130
<font color="yellow">Did you find one?</font>

840
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,200
<font color="yellow">Choong Dong.</font>

841
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,900
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

842
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,900
<font color="yellow">Let's...</font>

843
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:43,930
<font color="yellow">kill her.</font>

844
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,830
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

845
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,800
<font color="yellow">the only way.</font>

846
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,800
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

847
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,260
<font color="yellow">Do you remember what she said to you?</font>

848
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,930
<font color="yellow">If something happens to her, people would suspect you.</font>

849
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,230
<font color="yellow">There is...</font>

850
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,430
<font color="yellow">a way.</font>

851
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:24,530
<font color="yellow">First...</font>

852
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

853
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,600
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking about?</font>

854
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,630
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

855
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,400
<font color="yellow">Don't we get along well?</font>

856
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,400
<font color="yellow">It's as if we knew each other for years.</font>

857
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,730
<font color="yellow">You share a common goal.</font>

858
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,000
<font color="yellow">That must be it.</font>

859
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:19,800
<font color="yellow">Instead of seeing her off,</font>

860
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,530
<font color="yellow">I should've asked her out for a drink.</font>

861
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,930
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

862
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,330
<font color="yellow">I have to go home.</font>

863
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:37,930
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

864
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,400
<font color="yellow">Aren't you waiting for Gun Woo?</font>

865
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,700
<font color="yellow">I'll call him on the way.</font>

866
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,100
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

867
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,000
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

868
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,030
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

869
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,430
<font color="yellow">That's Soo Yeon's car.</font>

870
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,030
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, I need you to wake up.</font>

871
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,660
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon.</font>

872
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,500
<font color="yellow">(Monster)</font>

873
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,150
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh is like a ticking time bomb.</font>

874
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,790
<font color="yellow">You didn't listen to me.</font>

875
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,680
<font color="yellow">Her blood is on your hands.</font>

876
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,530
<font color="yellow">She's Dodo Group's chairman's daughter. She's quite an airhead.</font>

877
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,930
<font color="yellow">She tried to kill me!</font>

878
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,260
<font color="yellow">I will deal with it.</font>

879
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,330
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Mayor Byun.</font>

880
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,030
<font color="yellow">I should go and congratulate him in person.</font>

881
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,930
<font color="yellow">This will be the last time you feel any happiness.</font>
