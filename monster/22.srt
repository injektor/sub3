<font color="yellow">He said he'd be there on business.</font>

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,580

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,770
<font color="yellow">Murder wasn't a part of my plan.</font>

23
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,410
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a part of ours either.</font>

24
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,510
<font color="yellow">He just killed him.</font>

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,780
<font color="yellow">So don't ever give up,</font>

49
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,680
<font color="yellow">I tell you.</font>

50
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,710
<font color="yellow">He would never kill a person.</font>

51
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,470
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you a question.</font>

52
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,970
<font color="yellow">- Did...
-  Get out.</font>

53

54
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,600
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

55
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,370
<font color="yellow">May I check yesterday's CCTV footages?</font>

56
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,880
<font color="yellow">A police officer was just here.</font>

57
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
<font color="yellow">Are you a reporter?</font>

58
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,740
<font color="yellow">No, I have to look for something.</font>

59
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,210
<font color="yellow">They've all been deleted.</font>

60
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,610
<font color="yellow">You can't prove his innocence.</font>

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,250
<font color="yellow">No, I will make sure I prove that he's not guilty.</font>

62
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,510
<font color="yellow">- There he is.
-  He's here.</font>

63
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,840
<font color="yellow">Kang was arrested for the murder of Professor Na,</font>

64
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,470
<font color="yellow">who recently created a vaccine for a mutant virus.</font>

65
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,480
<font color="yellow">His case was sent to the prosecutor's office today.</font>

66
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,070
<font color="yellow">Prosecution believes he pocketed the blueprint of the vaccine.</font>

67
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,280
<font color="yellow">They are making every effort to find the missing blueprint.</font>

68
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,450
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know who really killed Do Gwang?</font>

69
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,480
<font color="yellow">It's Gi Tan.</font>

70
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,810
<font color="yellow">Show me the blueprint of the vaccine.</font>

71
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,510
<font color="yellow">The chemical formula must be hidden in here.</font>

72
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,510
<font color="yellow">It'll take a while for us to decode.</font>

73
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,650
<font color="yellow">I'll take it with me.</font>

74
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,850
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you'll decode it?</font>

75
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,480
<font color="yellow">What is it? Don't you trust me?</font>

76
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,080
<font color="yellow">Then you should have kept me out of your plans from the beginning.</font>

77
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,510
<font color="yellow">I never planned to kill Professor Na.</font>

78
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,270
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, I found out too much.</font>

79
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,370
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

80
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,650
<font color="yellow">Sure, you can take it.</font>

81
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,000
<font color="yellow">Director Byun.</font>

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,050
<font color="yellow">If you decode it, we would reach our goal.</font>

83
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,750
<font color="yellow">People with the same dream should stick together.</font>

84
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,110
<font color="yellow">I'll call you.</font>

85
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,050
<font color="yellow">Are you sure we can trust him?</font>

86
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,150
<font color="yellow">I have control over him. He won't act rashly.</font>

87
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,880
<font color="yellow">Find out where my father-in-law is.</font>

88
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,210
<font color="yellow">Dad, Il Jae is here.</font>

89
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,180
<font color="yellow">Did you get discharged?</font>

90
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,710
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

91
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,500
<font color="yellow">You lost your seat because of my incompetency...</font>

92
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,880
<font color="yellow">I don't care for a seat at the National Assembly.</font>

93
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,280
<font color="yellow">In order to catch the big fish,</font>

94
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,550
<font color="yellow">you must learn how to free the small fish.</font>

95
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,810
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

96
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,680
<font color="yellow">Since I broke my usual rod,</font>

97
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,110
<font color="yellow">It's difficult to go out to the big waters.</font>

98
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,550
<font color="yellow">Il Jae has the blueprint...</font>

99
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,650
<font color="yellow">for the mutant virus vaccine.</font>

100
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,880
<font color="yellow">I plan on founding an international business company.</font>

101
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,280
<font color="yellow">Once the new vaccine gets patented,</font>

102
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,550
<font color="yellow">there won't be a problem moving forth with our plan.</font>

103
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,380
<font color="yellow">When I heard that Gi Tan was involved,</font>

104
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,480
<font color="yellow">I had my doubts.</font>

105
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,250
<font color="yellow">You finally have the sword in your hands.</font>

106
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,710
<font color="yellow">While I was in a state of dejection,</font>

107
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,780
<font color="yellow">you were the one who helped me back on my feet.</font>

108
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,510
<font color="yellow">A pond like this...</font>

109
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,310
<font color="yellow">doesn't suit you.</font>

110
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,510
<font color="yellow">Your aunt...</font>

111
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,980
<font color="yellow">promised to give me...</font>

112
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,250
<font color="yellow">all of her shares at Dodo Group.</font>

113
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,140
<font color="yellow">- Dad.
-  Really?</font>

114
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,010
<font color="yellow">In return, I promised to help her...</font>

115
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,410
<font color="yellow">by getting Gwang Woo out on special pardon.</font>

116
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,940
<font color="yellow">Now that you have the sword in your hands,</font>

117
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,410
<font color="yellow">the day we take over Dodo Group will come faster than we expected.</font>

118
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,680
<font color="yellow">I'll show you, Sir.</font>

119
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,180
<font color="yellow">You'll soon catch the biggest fish on Earth.</font>

120
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,710
<font color="yellow">When I take...</font>

121
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,710
<font color="yellow">a big stretch tomorrow morning,</font>

122
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,650

134
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,070
<font color="yellow">I heard the blueprint for the mutant virus disappeared.</font>

135

-  What's wrong?</font>

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,210
<font color="yellow">I lost consciousness after drinking it.</font>

159
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,850
<font color="yellow">We already checked its components and it's completely fine.</font>

160
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,080
<font color="yellow">Then ask the friend who was drinking with me.</font>

161
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,650
<font color="yellow">He'll be my alibi.</font>

162
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,950
<font color="yellow">It's true that we drank together.</font>

163
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,710
<font color="yellow">But I became unconscious before him, so I'm not sure.</font>

164
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,370
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan said that someone...</font>

165
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,450
<font color="yellow">might have put drugs in the alcohol.</font>

166
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,480
<font color="yellow">I brought that drink.</font>

167
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,950
<font color="yellow">It's just really strong. I didn't put in any drugs.</font>

168
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,510
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

169
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,850
<font color="yellow">After getting the call, Gi Tan headed for Professor Na's room.</font>

170
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,510
<font color="yellow">Maybe it was an hour later.</font>

171
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,600
<font color="yellow">When I called him, Professor Na wanted to see me.</font>

172
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,400
<font color="yellow">Did you end up seeing him?</font>

173
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,840
<font color="yellow">Yes. We talked about our contract.</font>

174
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,610
<font color="yellow">The murder happened afterwards.</font>

175
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,650
<font color="yellow">Did Professor Na say anything about Gi Tan?</font>

176
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,080
<font color="yellow">He said that he felt pressured.</font>

177
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,710
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan tends to be persistent.</font>

178
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,710
<font color="yellow">- Did you do as I told you to?
-  Yes.</font>

179
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,610
<font color="yellow">But Gi Tan lost his consciousness after drinking. How did...</font>

180
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,210
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth.</font>

181
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,870
<font color="yellow">The police will find out the truth. Don't let anyone know what you did.</font>

182
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,980
<font color="yellow">Do it for the company.</font>

183
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,680
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

184
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,710
<font color="yellow">You've tainted our company's name.</font>

185
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,710
<font color="yellow">You know more than anyone else...</font>

186
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,610
<font color="yellow">that I'm innocent.</font>

187
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,000
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I framed you?</font>

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,050
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

189
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,880
<font color="yellow">You don't have the power to do that.</font>

190
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,580
<font color="yellow">But Il Jae does.</font>

191
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,720
<font color="yellow">We'll see if you can say that in court.</font>

192
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,180
<font color="yellow">Tell Director Byun this.</font>

193
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,880
<font color="yellow">He picked the wrong person.</font>

194
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,050
<font color="yellow">- Gi Tan.
-  Also,</font>

195
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,950
<font color="yellow">you'll regret getting involved in this.</font>

196
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
<font color="yellow">I won't...</font>

197
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,310
<font color="yellow">forgive you.</font>

198
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,510
<font color="yellow">What does he mean?</font>

199
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,980
<font color="yellow">What does this have to do with Director Byun?</font>

200
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,810
<font color="yellow">He's talking nonsense since he's cornered. Ignore him.</font>

201
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,480
<font color="yellow">Dad, you know Gi Tan isn't like that.</font>

202
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,610
<font color="yellow">He was working so hard to get Professor Na's signature.</font>

203
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,550
<font color="yellow">How does the investigation look?</font>

204
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,410
<font color="yellow">There's evidence and his motives are clear.</font>

205
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,680
<font color="yellow">Even if we hire a talented attorney,</font>

206
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,700
<font color="yellow">it'll be hard to get him acquitted.</font>

207
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,580
<font color="yellow">What about probation?</font>

208
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,500
<font color="yellow">Or maybe it could be seen as accidental homicide.</font>

209
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,600
<font color="yellow">We should hire famous lawyers to...</font>

210
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,610
<font color="yellow">I disagree.</font>

211
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,550
<font color="yellow">There are suspicions that our company is involved in the murder.</font>

212
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,040
<font color="yellow">If we help Gi Tan,</font>

213
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,210
<font color="yellow">it'll only make those suspicions stronger.</font>

214
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,110
<font color="yellow">According to the prosecutors,</font>

215
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,710
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan claimed that he was framed by someone.</font>

216
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
<font color="yellow">Framed?</font>

217
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,950
<font color="yellow">Who would do that?</font>

218
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,510
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan...</font>

219
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,380
<font color="yellow">apparently mentioned Byun Il Jae.</font>

220
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,210
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae?</font>

221
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,680
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan is not the type to talk nonsense.</font>

222
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,600
<font color="yellow">Then Director Byun must be the suspect.</font>

223
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,570
<font color="yellow">As for the prosecutors, they believe...</font>

224
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,710
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan's testimony is absolutely not trustworthy.</font>

225
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,080
<font color="yellow">Form a defence counsel.</font>

226
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,450
<font color="yellow">I don't care if he is the murderer or not.</font>

227
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,450
<font color="yellow">This happened while he was working.</font>

228
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,010
<font color="yellow">It's what we should do.</font>

229
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,750
<font color="yellow">I will see to it.</font>

230
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,250
<font color="yellow">You're the best, Dad.</font>

231
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,180
<font color="yellow">(Do Gun Woo)</font>

232
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,810
<font color="yellow">Speak.</font>

233
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,980
<font color="yellow">From Dodo Group?</font>

234
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,550
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

235
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,450
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

236
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,370
<font color="yellow">It looks like Chairman will save Gi Tan.</font>

237
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,610
<font color="yellow">Do Choong?</font>

238
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,010
<font color="yellow">If he is found not guilty, things will get complicated.</font>

239
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,310
<font color="yellow">I think it's your turn to step up, Sir.</font>

240
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,610
<font color="yellow">Chairman is waiting for you.</font>

241
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,460
<font color="yellow">It's been a while, Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

242
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,480
<font color="yellow">I was too busy to visit you.</font>

243
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,920
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you didn't come.</font>

244
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,010
<font color="yellow">I heard I looked ridiculous.</font>

245
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,210
<font color="yellow">Isn't it weird?</font>

246
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,240
<font color="yellow">I don't know why Gi Tan said...</font>

247
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,880
<font color="yellow">you were the real murderer.</font>

248
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,050
<font color="yellow">Weren't you at a mental institution?</font>

249
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,540
<font color="yellow">According to Gi Tan, that means you carved up a plan...</font>

250
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,750
<font color="yellow">while pretending to have a mental disease.</font>

251
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,320
<font color="yellow">Is this why you formed a defence counsel?</font>

252
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,870
<font color="yellow">You're not the only one with connections to the prosecution.</font>

253
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,270
<font color="yellow">I have ears, too.</font>

254
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,410
<font color="yellow">Chairman is very curious about the whole story.</font>

255
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,080
<font color="yellow">We'll find out the truth once Gi Tan is out.</font>

256
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,550
<font color="yellow">Chairman...</font>

257
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,170
<font color="yellow">won't be able to form a defence counsel.</font>

258
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,350
<font color="yellow">I will give you my word.</font>

259
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,450
<font color="yellow">Anyways,</font>

260
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,780
<font color="yellow">aren't you discharged a bit too early?</font>

261
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,040
<font color="yellow">Schizophrenia isn't so easily...</font>

262
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,080
<font color="yellow">There are...</font>

263
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,530
<font color="yellow">exceptions to everything.</font>

264
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,510
<font color="yellow">Right, exceptions.</font>

265
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,480
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

266
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,710
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me...</font>

267
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,180
<font color="yellow">to stop helping Gi Tan?</font>

268
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,650
<font color="yellow">He's someone who betrayed me...</font>

269
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,950
<font color="yellow">after he pretended to help me.</font>

270
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,320
<font color="yellow">Thanks to him,</font>

271
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,250
<font color="yellow">I've been ruled out of everything.</font>

272
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,210
<font color="yellow">I cannot forgive him.</font>

273
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,250
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you didn't think I would accept your terms.</font>

274
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,350
<font color="yellow">So what is this...</font>

275
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,270
<font color="yellow">that makes you so confident?</font>

276
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,250
<font color="yellow">You are very quick-witted.</font>

277
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,080
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

278
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,880
<font color="yellow">I do not have anything with me.</font>

279
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,080
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me to do something...</font>

280
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,810
<font color="yellow">without any condition?</font>

281
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,950
<font color="yellow">Instead,</font>

282
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,320
<font color="yellow">I have buried a bomb inside of my heart.</font>

283
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,120
<font color="yellow">A bomb?</font>

284
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,880
<font color="yellow">It's a bomb...</font>

285
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,320
<font color="yellow">that will kill both of us once it's blown up.</font>

286
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,250
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

287
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,840
<font color="yellow">are you talking about?</font>

288
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,350
<font color="yellow">It's everything...</font>

289
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,320
<font color="yellow">I learned about you while I helped you.</font>

290
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,170
<font color="yellow">It's about everything that's illegal.</font>

291
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,470
<font color="yellow">Tax evasion, bribe, lobbying...</font>

292
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,680
<font color="yellow">and even women problems.</font>

293
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,350
<font color="yellow">I will expose them to the entire world.</font>

294
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,510
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

295
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,980
<font color="yellow">that you'll go down with me?</font>

296
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,010
<font color="yellow">You're the one who emptied me out...</font>

297
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,280
<font color="yellow">with Gi Tan's help.</font>

298
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,180
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to lose.</font>

299
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,250
<font color="yellow">So what can't I do at this point?</font>

300
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,010
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree, Choong?</font>

301
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,520
<font color="yellow">What happened with the defence counsel?</font>

302
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,840
<font color="yellow">I've contacted Oh Gwang...</font>

303
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,440
<font color="yellow">and asked for their best...</font>

304
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,210
<font color="yellow">- Cancel it.
-  What?</font>

305
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,250
<font color="yellow">Take your hands off...</font>

306
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,880
<font color="yellow">of Gi Tan's case.</font>

307
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,150

<font color="yellow">No one is helping Gi Tan.</font>

310
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,180

<font color="yellow">(Oh Soo Yeon)</font>

312
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,380
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

313
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,320
<font color="yellow">I got it, so stop crying.</font>

314
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,950
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying so easily these days?</font>

315
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,780
<font color="yellow">Can you go and meet with Gi Tan?</font>

316
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,270
<font color="yellow">I'll be there right after work.</font>

317
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,580
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

318
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,150
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the prosecutor's office.</font>

319
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,720
<font color="yellow">Didn't that make you feel sad, too?</font>

320
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,710
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to hear her voice anyways?</font>

321
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,250
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

322
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,540
<font color="yellow">isn't sick, is she?</font>

323
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,980
<font color="yellow">My gosh, she's a mess.</font>

324
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,240
<font color="yellow">She's been looking...</font>

325
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,550
<font color="yellow">for evidence everywhere to prove your innocence.</font>

326
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,710
<font color="yellow">Even if she's ill, she's probably holding back.</font>

327
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,540
<font color="yellow">To be honest, Soo Yeon is...</font>

328
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,210
<font color="yellow">Don't tell him that we're childhood friends.</font>

329
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,650
<font color="yellow">Why not? I thought you missed him.</font>

330
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,110
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason why...</font>

331
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,050
<font color="yellow">he didn't say anything to me.</font>

332
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,480
<font color="yellow">He may not want to get recognised...</font>

333
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,830
<font color="yellow">because he's not doing so well.</font>

334
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,310
<font color="yellow">Will you keep it a secret forever?</font>

335
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,980
<font color="yellow">I will wait until he is ready.</font>

336
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,790
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

337
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,510
<font color="yellow">It'll be better if you talk to him about that.</font>

338
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,250
<font color="yellow">What about her?</font>

339
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,350
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing.</font>

340
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,510
<font color="yellow">Now, where were we?</font>

341
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,280
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

342
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,740
<font color="yellow">Did you say people who framed you are...</font>

343
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,510
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae, Do Gun Woo and Oh Choong Dong?</font>

344
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,480
<font color="yellow">I believe my speculation is right.</font>

345
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,790
<font color="yellow">According to the prosecutor, they all have alibis.</font>

346
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,640
<font color="yellow">Did you look for Oh Choong Dong's alibi?</font>

347
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, he was in Seoul that night.</font>

348
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,850
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

349
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,780
<font color="yellow">It's not so promising.</font>

350
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,410
<font color="yellow">I didn't kill him!</font>

351
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,410
<font color="yellow">I know, I know.</font>

352
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,100
<font color="yellow">But what can I do?</font>

353
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,780
<font color="yellow">There isn't a way to prove your innocence.</font>

354
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,380
<font color="yellow">Please keep this...</font>

355
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,680
<font color="yellow">a secret from Soo Yeon.</font>

356
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,050
<font color="yellow">She'll be very curious.</font>

357
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,880
<font color="yellow">The more she tries to help me,</font>

358
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,210
<font color="yellow">the more in danger she'll be in.</font>

359
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,880
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Il Jae?</font>

360
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,960
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Min?</font>

361
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,800
<font color="yellow">Did that public defender take his case?</font>

362
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,550
<font color="yellow">The prosecutor said that he's rather good.</font>

363
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,410
<font color="yellow">I really don't like him.</font>

364
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,550
<font color="yellow">If he brings out the fact...</font>

365
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,210
<font color="yellow">that he's a first-time offender and that he was drunk,</font>

366
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,850
<font color="yellow">he may receive much less of a sentence than I expected.</font>

367
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,810
<font color="yellow">9077, you have a visitor.</font>

368
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,210
<font color="yellow">Look who this is.</font>

369
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,350
<font color="yellow">I thought you were insane but you look fine.</font>

370
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,710
<font color="yellow">It's been a while, Gwang Woo.</font>

371
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,180
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mr Byun.</font>

372
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,380
<font color="yellow">You've become quite bold.</font>

373
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,580
<font color="yellow">How dare you come visit me...</font>

374
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,980
<font color="yellow">after putting me in here?</font>

375
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,240
<font color="yellow">The one who put you in here isn't me, but Gi Tan.</font>

376
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,880
<font color="yellow">He's on your side!</font>

377
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,640
<font color="yellow">Did you think I didn't know that?</font>

378
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,430
<font color="yellow">I've been fooled by him, too.</font>

379
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,810
<font color="yellow">Stop your nonsense and be prepared to go down...</font>

380
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,180
<font color="yellow">once I'm out of here.</font>

381
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,250
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan is...</font>

382
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,080
<font color="yellow">Lee Guk Cheol.</font>

383
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,640
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

384
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,980
<font color="yellow">Lee Guk Cheol.</font>

385
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,380
<font color="yellow">He's the son of Sudo Hospital, who died because of you.</font>

386
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,570
<font color="yellow">He died.</font>

387
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,650
<font color="yellow">He didn't.</font>

388
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,480
<font color="yellow">That's why all of this happened.</font>

389
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,050
<font color="yellow">What about his eyes?</font>

390
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,770
<font color="yellow">How can he see?</font>

391
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,680
<font color="yellow">They were curable with surgery.</font>

392
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,010
<font color="yellow">He approached us on purpose.</font>

393
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,210
<font color="yellow">We were both fooled by him.</font>

394
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

395
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,870
<font color="yellow">His parents didn't die because of me.</font>

396
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,080
<font color="yellow">You killed them!</font>

397
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,880
<font color="yellow">You ordered me to kill them by threatening me!</font>

398
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,710
<font color="yellow">His trial will be soon.</font>

399
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,010
<font color="yellow">Once he's found guilty and ends up coming here,</font>

400
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,110
<font color="yellow">I intend to put him in your cell.</font>

401
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,010
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to get rid of him?</font>

402
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,810
<font color="yellow">Kill him or not,</font>

403
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,850
<font color="yellow">it's up to you.</font>

404
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,380
<font color="yellow">It'll be best to have him within your eyesight.</font>

405
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,850
<font color="yellow">Boss, why are you still up?</font>

406
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,280
<font color="yellow">Is something worrying you?</font>

407
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
<font color="yellow">Kang Gi Tan...</font>

408
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,400
<font color="yellow">might come here.</font>

409
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,210
<font color="yellow">That's good news.</font>

410
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,340
<font color="yellow">Just give me the order...</font>

411
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,000
<font color="yellow">and I'll have my boys get him.</font>

412
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,310
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

413
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,870
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

414
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,110
<font color="yellow">Don't you watch the news?</font>

415
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,640
<font color="yellow">He might have the blueprint for the vaccine.</font>

416
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,650
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

417
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,550
<font color="yellow">I hear it's worth a lot of money.</font>

418
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,010
<font color="yellow">If we can get that blueprint from Gi Tan,</font>

419
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,650
<font color="yellow">my life will turn around overnight.</font>

420
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,980
<font color="yellow">Does that mean you'll become the chairman of Dodo Group?</font>

421
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,680
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

422
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,280
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much that vaccine would sell for?</font>

423
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,180
<font color="yellow">Please let me help you.</font>

424
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,370
<font color="yellow">Blueprints and anything else.</font>

425
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,880
<font color="yellow">I'll steal it from him and then get rid of him.</font>

426
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,680
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm still up.</font>

427
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,310
<font color="yellow">How should I cook him up...</font>

428
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,850

00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,450
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

469
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,250
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Boss.</font>

470
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,510
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

471
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,080
<font color="yellow">I know you and Il Jae are the ones that put me here.</font>

472
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,780
<font color="yellow">But to be honest,</font>

473
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,710
<font color="yellow">you're innocent.</font>

474
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,880
<font color="yellow">You only did what he told you to. Aren't I right?</font>

475
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,450
<font color="yellow">The one I want to pay back is Il Jae,</font>

476
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,410
<font color="yellow">not you.</font>

477
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,750
<font color="yellow">While you're here,</font>

478
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,480
<font color="yellow">let's try and get along.</font>

479
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,950
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan didn't take...</font>

480
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,110
<font color="yellow">the MK2 vaccine's blueprint.</font>

481
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,280
<font color="yellow">Someone else is behind this.</font>

482
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,400
<font color="yellow">I'll catch the suspect...</font>

483
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,750
<font color="yellow">and bring you the blueprint, Boss.</font>

484
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,180
<font color="yellow">You two...</font>

485
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,350
<font color="yellow">are no longer in charge of this.</font>

486
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,310
<font color="yellow">- I'll get to it myself.
-  Boss.</font>

487
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,540
<font color="yellow">Even if it means killing Gi Tan,</font>

488
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,510
<font color="yellow">that blueprint must come into my hands.</font>

489
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,750
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, it's me, Chae Ryung.</font>

490
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,250
<font color="yellow">Cha Woo and I are under close surveillance by the boss.</font>

491
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,950
<font color="yellow">The boss thinks that you have the vaccine's blueprint.</font>

492
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,480
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

493
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,010
<font color="yellow">There are Huaping people in the penitentiary.</font>

494
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,710
<font color="yellow">I don't know if they're trying to kill you or to steal the blueprint.</font>

495
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,750
<font color="yellow">I can't be sure.</font>

496
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,110
<font color="yellow">What I'm sure of is that you're in danger.</font>

497
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,650
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I can't be of any help.</font>

498
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,180
<font color="yellow">What are you up to?</font>

499
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:26,110
<font color="yellow">Don't walk around alone here.</font>

500
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,770
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of insane people here.</font>

501
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,310
<font color="yellow">If you're unlucky, you might never open your eyes again.</font>

502
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,310
<font color="yellow">I have this place under control.</font>

503
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,250
<font color="yellow">If you stick with me, you won't have any problems.</font>

504
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,180
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo is the king here.</font>

505
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,170
<font color="yellow">Just trust him.</font>

506
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,450
<font color="yellow">Are you going to stay there?</font>

507
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,580
<font color="yellow">I need time to think alone.</font>

508
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,970
<font color="yellow">Hey, take the boys over there.</font>

509
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:55,980
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

510
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,780
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

511
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,350
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

512
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,080
<font color="yellow">There is something...</font>

513
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,650
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to you about businesswise.</font>

514
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,150
<font color="yellow">Don't take this the wrong way.</font>

515
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,110
<font color="yellow">- Do you happen to...
-  Vaccine's blueprint?</font>

516
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, the blueprint.</font>

517
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,110
<font color="yellow">Do you want to split it in half with me?</font>

518
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,500
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what I mean? Hand it over to me...</font>

519
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,850
<font color="yellow">and I'll give you 50 percent in royalties.</font>

520
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,880
<font color="yellow">I'll be discharged with a special pardon soon.</font>

521
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,810
<font color="yellow">I promise to get you out on parole.</font>

522
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,280
<font color="yellow">- Tell me where the blueprint...
-  I don't have it.</font>

523
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,160
<font color="yellow">Come on, you can trust me this once.</font>

524
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,080
<font color="yellow">You're barking up the wrong tree.</font>

525
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

526
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,450
<font color="yellow">how you're going to play it?</font>

527
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,850
<font color="yellow">Shall I lie and say I have it?</font>

528
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
<font color="yellow">Will you believe me then?</font>

529
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,450
<font color="yellow">Do you really not have it?</font>

530
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,980
<font color="yellow">I really don't.</font>

531
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,510
<font color="yellow">Too bad, then.</font>

532
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,850
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

533
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,000
<font color="yellow">treat me with respect.</font>

534
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,220
<font color="yellow">I don't like your tone.</font>

535
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,880
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful, Sir.</font>

536
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,080
<font color="yellow">Did you think I'd say that?</font>

537
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,580
<font color="yellow">There's nothing but fury left inside of me.</font>

538
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,250
<font color="yellow">I'm here because I was framed for murder,</font>

539
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,050
<font color="yellow">but if you provoke me, I might actually kill you.</font>

540
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,950
<font color="yellow">Watch out.</font>

541
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:15,850
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

542
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,450
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

543
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,350
<font color="yellow">We should...</font>

544
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,220
<font color="yellow">host a welcoming event for him tonight.</font>

545
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,650
<font color="yellow">Got it, Boss.</font>

546
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

547
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,360
<font color="yellow">Who's going to solitary?</font>

548
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,680
<font color="yellow">Me, Boss.</font>

549
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
<font color="yellow">Cover him up.</font>

550
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

551
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,460
<font color="yellow">You don't take me seriously, do you?</font>

552
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,340
<font color="yellow">This is your lesson.</font>

553
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,980
<font color="yellow">You arrogant piece of scum. Die!</font>

554
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,410
<font color="yellow">Die! Die!</font>

555
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,280
<font color="yellow">Die! Die! Die!</font>

556
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,010
<font color="yellow">Die!</font>

557
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,610
<font color="yellow">How dare you...</font>

558
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,550
<font color="yellow">turn your back on our boss.</font>

559
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,480
<font color="yellow">You need to be taught a lesson.</font>

560
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,310
<font color="yellow">This isn't working.</font>

561
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,150
<font color="yellow">Hold him up.</font>

562
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,250
<font color="yellow">I'll beat him up myself.</font>

563
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,550
<font color="yellow">Who did it?</font>

564
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,160
<font color="yellow">Who beat him up?</font>

565
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,640
<font color="yellow">He taunted us, so I taught him a lesson.</font>

566
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,860
<font color="yellow">You're going to solitary.</font>

567
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,880
<font color="yellow">Take him.</font>

568
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,280
<font color="yellow">Let's get ready for bed.</font>

569
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,070
<font color="yellow">What sleep?</font>

570
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,340
<font color="yellow">You won't be getting any sleep!</font>

571
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,740
<font color="yellow">Let's see how long you will hold up!</font>

572
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,150
<font color="yellow">We'll do this every day!</font>

573
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,050
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

574
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,750
<font color="yellow">I'm being nice here.</font>

575
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,610
<font color="yellow">Tell me where the blueprint is.</font>

576
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,880
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling unwell?</font>

577
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,530
<font color="yellow">Why can't you eat?</font>

578
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,880
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me.</font>

579
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,150
<font color="yellow">I have no appetite,</font>

580
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,050
<font color="yellow">no will to live and I feel depressed.</font>

581
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,850
<font color="yellow">We have doctors for a reason.</font>

582
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,110
<font color="yellow">Go and see Doctor Hwang.</font>

583
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,230
<font color="yellow">Is it depression?</font>

584
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,880
<font color="yellow">I doubt that.</font>

585
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,550
<font color="yellow">Is it...</font>

586
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,840
<font color="yellow">about Gi Tan?</font>

587
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,580
<font color="yellow">Why would I lose my appetite over him?</font>

588
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,720
<font color="yellow">It's because I didn't get the vaccine deal.</font>

589
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,250
<font color="yellow">Come by for breakfast more often.</font>

590
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

591
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,840
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

592
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,120
<font color="yellow">An extraordinary general meeting was called.</font>

593
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,610
<font color="yellow">An EGM was called?</font>

594
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,950
<font color="yellow">By whom?</font>

595
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,680
<font color="yellow">Your wife, Sir.</font>

596
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,280
<font color="yellow">What's the agenda?</font>

597
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,180
<font color="yellow">The dismissal of Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo.</font>

598
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,000
<font color="yellow">Where are your manners?</font>

599
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,310
<font color="yellow">That's what I should ask.</font>

600
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,150
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

601
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,150
<font color="yellow">Can't you see?</font>

602
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,340
<font color="yellow">I'm here skipping breakfast because I can't stand Gun Woo.</font>

603
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,780
<font color="yellow">The EGM.</font>

604
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,350
<font color="yellow">Cancel it immediately!</font>

605
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,610
<font color="yellow">Is that what this is about?</font>

606
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,240
<font color="yellow">I thought it was something serious.</font>

607
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,370
<font color="yellow">Call it off right now!</font>

608
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,860
<font color="yellow">Do you know what Gun Woo did to me?</font>

609
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,340
<font color="yellow">He stood up to me in public.</font>

610
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,880
<font color="yellow">He challenged me.</font>

611
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,050
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

612
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,940
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

613
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,780
<font color="yellow">Promote him further.</font>

614
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,380
<font color="yellow">Make him CEO if you will.</font>

615
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,550
<font color="yellow">I will still push him off the cliff.</font>

616
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,600
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

617
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,530
<font color="yellow">Don't call me that. It makes my skin crawl.</font>

618
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,080
<font color="yellow">If you keep doing this,</font>

619
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,510
<font color="yellow">I might actually make a very critical decision.</font>

620
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,780
<font color="yellow">What critical decision?</font>

621
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,160
<font color="yellow">You're not going to make Gun Woo...</font>

622
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,180
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

623
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,270

<font color="yellow">Call off the extraordinary general meeting right now.</font>

626
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,580
<font color="yellow">If you don't,</font>

627
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,960
<font color="yellow">at that very meeting,</font>

628
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,280
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo will be welcomed with a round of applause.</font>

629
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,680
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

630
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,050
<font color="yellow">you want me to cross the line.</font>

631
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,950
<font color="yellow">Be careful, Gi Tan.</font>

632
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,410
<font color="yellow">There are Huaping people in that prison.</font>

634

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,370
<font color="yellow">Is it Oh Soo Yeon?</font>

636
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,680
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Go and find out.</font>

637
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,510
<font color="yellow">You look terrible.</font>

638
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,980
<font color="yellow">Come and sit.</font>

639
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,050
<font color="yellow">This is all I can do for my own nephew.</font>

640
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,250
<font color="yellow">I didn't think...</font>

641
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,980
<font color="yellow">you would kill someone, Guk Cheol.</font>

642
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,150
<font color="yellow">Why don't you...</font>

643
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,480
<font color="yellow">hand over the blueprint?</font>

644
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,450
<font color="yellow">Stop being so creepy.</font>

645
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,110
<font color="yellow">I know you took it.</font>

646
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,250
<font color="yellow">You should have...</font>

647
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,580
<font color="yellow">died that day.</font>

648
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,510
<font color="yellow">Or never reappeared.</font>

649
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,870
<font color="yellow">This is where the real torture begins.</font>

650
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,380
<font color="yellow">Do you remember what I said?</font>

651
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,650
<font color="yellow">I said that if I survived,</font>

652
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,540
<font color="yellow">I would get my revenge.</font>

653
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, Guk Cheol. Get your revenge.</font>

654
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,780
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

655
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,250
<font color="yellow">someone else told me to kill your parents.</font>

656

<font color="yellow">Do Gwang Woo.</font>

657
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,880
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to give you,</font>

658
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,170
<font color="yellow">but I thought you'd want to know why your parents died.</font>

659
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,650
<font color="yellow">Consider it a gift.</font>

660
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,780
<font color="yellow">I heard that inmates here die of various causes.</font>

661

<font color="yellow">Lee Guk Cheol.</font>

663
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,010
<font color="yellow">I wonder who will die first.</font>

664
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,380
<font color="yellow">Whoever it may be, I will attend the funeral.</font>

665

<font color="yellow">and get out alive.</font>

668
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,550
<font color="yellow">Sorry. You can't see him.</font>

669
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,470
<font color="yellow">Can't you let me in?</font>

670
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,310
<font color="yellow">But he told us first...</font>

671

675
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,850
<font color="yellow">Did you tell him on purpose?</font>

676
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,210
<font color="yellow">Now that Guk Cheol knows, things will get interesting.</font>

677

<font color="yellow">He knows who Gi Tan is.</font>

687
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,350
<font color="yellow">How would I know? Only he knows why.</font>

693
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:01,410
<font color="yellow">Nothing. Forget about it. I have a headache.</font>

694

<font color="yellow">Oh, right, I'm in trouble.</font>

696
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,380

00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:00,880
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

782
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,750
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I got my sight back?</font>

783
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:08,050
<font color="yellow">Because I wanted to see who had killed my parents.</font>

784
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,250
<font color="yellow">I'm so grateful that we sleep in the same room.</font>

785
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,750
<font color="yellow">I can kill you whenever I want.</font>

786
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,380
<font color="yellow">Wait, Gi Tan.</font>

787
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,550
<font color="yellow">Your life ends the day you kill me.</font>

788
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,980
<font color="yellow">You still have years to live.</font>

789
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,680
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be a waste to throw it all away?</font>

790
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,380
<font color="yellow">It would be.</font>

791
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,180
<font color="yellow">Because I have the blueprint.</font>

792
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,780
<font color="yellow">But I have to rot in here for five years.</font>

793
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,580
<font color="yellow">By then, another company will have developed the vaccine.</font>

794
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,450
<font color="yellow">I'd rather kill you and avenge my parents!</font>

795
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,180
<font color="yellow">The blueprint.</font>

796
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,380
<font color="yellow">Do you have it?</font>

797
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:01,880
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do. Do you think I killed a man for fun?</font>

798
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,010
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

799
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,550
<font color="yellow">I get out soon because of a special pardon.</font>

800
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,680
<font color="yellow">Once I'm out,</font>

801
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,180
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever I can to get you out on parole.</font>

802
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:17,550
<font color="yellow">So give me the blueprint.</font>

803
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,400
<font color="yellow">When you get pardoned,</font>

804
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,780
<font color="yellow">take me with you.</font>

805
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

806
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,850
<font color="yellow">practically impossible.</font>

807
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:34,780
<font color="yellow">I'll ask for a retrial. Help me get acquitted.</font>

808
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,350
<font color="yellow">Until I get out,</font>

809
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,810
<font color="yellow">I will never give you the blueprint.</font>

810
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:43,810
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

811
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:46,410
<font color="yellow">But in return,</font>

812
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:52,280
<font color="yellow">you'd better keep your side of the bargain.</font>

813
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,410
<font color="yellow">We know what Gi Tan is.</font>

814
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,310
<font color="yellow">He's an industrial spy.</font>

815
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,500
<font color="yellow">He was caught for murder while trying...</font>

816
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,870
<font color="yellow">to steal the blueprint to the mutant virus vaccine to sell to China.</font>

817
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,700
<font color="yellow">Are you sure he killed the professor?</font>

818
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,680
<font color="yellow">The court found him guilty. Why would you ask that?</font>

819
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,380
<font color="yellow">I understand the spy part,</font>

820
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,880
<font color="yellow">- but murder...
-  Hey.</font>

821
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,180
<font color="yellow">You aren't a fortune teller.</font>

822
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,480
<font color="yellow">You have a mission to stick to.</font>

823
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

824
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,680
<font color="yellow">We have orders to get Gi Tan out of prison.</font>

825
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,680
<font color="yellow">Help him break out...</font>

826
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,380
<font color="yellow">and get the blueprint.</font>

827
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,200
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

828
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,180
<font color="yellow">If that blueprint ends up in foreign hands,</font>

829
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,870
<font color="yellow">it will cause us a huge loss.</font>

830
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:53,040
<font color="yellow">We have to prevent that.</font>

831
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,670
<font color="yellow">Jailbreak is illegal. However important our mission is...</font>

832
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:57,510
<font color="yellow">As soon as we get the blueprint,</font>

833
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,180
<font color="yellow">he will go straight back to prison.</font>

834
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,950
<font color="yellow">Do you get it?</font>

835
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

836
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,850
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll be right there.</font>

837
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,880
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

838
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,380
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

839
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,230
<font color="yellow">We last met in Hong Kong three years ago.</font>

840
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,320
<font color="yellow">I would say so.</font>

841
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,300
<font color="yellow">Sorry for calling you...</font>

842
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,550
<font color="yellow">whenever I'm in a bind.</font>

843
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,580
<font color="yellow">This is just enough.</font>

844
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:45,590
<font color="yellow">Any more calls would get me into trouble.</font>

845
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,670
<font color="yellow">How are things?</font>

846
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,110
<font color="yellow">I know an agent who knows Gi Tan very well.</font>

847
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,850
<font color="yellow">I'll send that agent in.</font>

848
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:55,650
<font color="yellow">We will get Gi Tan out of prison.</font>

849
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,030
<font color="yellow">You take care of the rest.</font>

850
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,350
<font color="yellow">How do you plan to get him out?</font>

851
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,010
<font color="yellow">That part is very simple.</font>

852
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,080
<font color="yellow">What happens next is the problem.</font>

853
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,050
<font color="yellow">That's why I asked for your help.</font>

854
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,310
<font color="yellow">Food.</font>

855
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:24,400
<font color="yellow">We aren't a bunch of goats. Is this all we get to eat?</font>

856
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,140
<font color="yellow">Don't we get any meat?</font>

857
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,860
<font color="yellow">Shut up and eat.</font>

858
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,050
<font color="yellow">8253.</font>

859
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,450
<font color="yellow">This is for you.</font>

860
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,210
<font color="yellow">- Here.
-  What soup is it?</font>

861
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,950
<font color="yellow">(The Bible)</font>

862
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:01,040
<font color="yellow">Genesis 9:20, James 1:20,</font>

863
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,450
<font color="yellow">Jeremiah 50:36.</font>

864
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,080
<font color="yellow">Are you religious?</font>

865
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,950
<font color="yellow">Who would send you a Bible?</font>

866
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:27,510
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

867
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:40,750
<font color="yellow">Sorry about that.</font>
