31
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:07,033
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

32
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:09,854
<font color="yellow">Of course he's saying he's okay.
Would he say it hurts?</font>

41
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,314
<font color="yellow">He kept mouthing off to me.</font>

42
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:39,865
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I was mouthing off?</font>

43
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:40,956
<font color="yellow">I was just joking.</font>

44
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:44,114
<font color="yellow">There is only so much I can take.
What kind of joke is that?</font>

45
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:48,018
<font color="yellow">We are doctors. We need to be the best.</font>

46
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:49,407
<font color="yellow">Can't you control yourself?</font>

47
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:51,228
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

48
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:53,788
<font color="yellow">- Why should you be sorry?
- Huh?</font>

49

<font color="yellow">Kang Soo, I've only worked with you
a little bit, so I didn't know.</font>

50
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,701
<font color="yellow">But you're not a bad guy.</font>

51
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:02,300
<font color="yellow">If someone treats you this way,
you treat them the way you see fit.</font>

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,320
<font color="yellow">You can go.</font>

53
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,401
<font color="yellow">Go now.</font>

54
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:12,463
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

55
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,185
<font color="yellow">Isn't this wrong?</font>

56
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:16,436
<font color="yellow">I think so too.</font>

57
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,265
<font color="yellow">What's with the cotton for a nosebleed?</font>

58
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,264
<font color="yellow">You are a doctor.</font>

59
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:21,877
<font color="yellow">That's for show, like in Hollywood.</font>

60
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:24,278
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to be like this?</font>

61
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:26,359
<font color="yellow">Trouble usually starts in the home so...</font>

62
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,498
<font color="yellow">If you get hit again,
you're in big trouble.</font>

63
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,046
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Let's just go eat.</font>

64
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:38,163
<font color="yellow">What a waste of your physical size.</font>

65
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,520
<font color="yellow">It was a surprise attack.</font>

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,728
<font color="yellow">What surprise attack? Come on.</font>

67
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,824
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?
Are you that tired?</font>

68
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:59,415
<font color="yellow">I'm in my first year so it's expected.</font>

69
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,652
<font color="yellow">First years don't quite have
the knack for it yet.</font>

70
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:04,843
<font color="yellow">Still, you should utilize your time.</font>

71
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:06,693
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

72
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,485
<font color="yellow">- High five.
- Yes.</font>

73
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,107
<font color="yellow">What kind of mother are you?
Can you actually eat?</font>

74
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,685
<font color="yellow">Your daughter isn't even home.</font>

75
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,790
<font color="yellow">Why are you causing such a fuss?</font>

76
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:32,889
<font color="yellow">She often didn't come home
when she was last on duty.</font>

77
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:34,346
<font color="yellow">I told you that I yelled at her.</font>

78
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:35,579
<font color="yellow">You did a good thing.</font>

79
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,795
<font color="yellow">She needs to lose some affection for you
to know how precious her mother is.</font>

80
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:41,384
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What about it?</font>

81
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:44,464
<font color="yellow">She's always been too attached to you
ever since she was little.</font>

82
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:46,108
<font color="yellow">The two of you always did leave me out.</font>

83
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:48,697
<font color="yellow">Stop saying these useless things
and go see her.</font>

84
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,925
<font color="yellow">What, exactly, did you do to her?</font>

85
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:53,834
<font color="yellow">It's not like you hit her or anything.</font>

86
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,632
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Never mind.</font>

87
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,593
<font color="yellow">Sir, how are you?</font>

88
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:05,829
<font color="yellow">It still hurts so much.</font>

89
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:07,398
<font color="yellow">Where does it hurt?</font>

90
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:09,406
<font color="yellow">My eye, right here.</font>

91
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:14,098
<font color="yellow">My head hurts too and there's something
that keeps oozing from the wound.</font>

92
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:16,206
<font color="yellow">Are you giving him antibiotics?</font>

93
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:19,057
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're getting consults from the
Internal Medicine department too.</font>

94
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:22,875
<font color="yellow">Once he gets better,
stop the TPN and give him food.</font>

95
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,947
<font color="yellow"><i>[Director Jin Myung Hoon]</i></font>

96
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:38,461
<font color="yellow">It's hard to see you.</font>

97
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

98
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,240
<font color="yellow">Didn't your father talk to you?</font>

99
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,221
<font color="yellow">I heard about the proposal for me
to become a board member.</font>

100
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,928
<font color="yellow">We will be nominating you
at the next board meeting.</font>

101
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:53,581
<font color="yellow">We're calling it a nomination,
but you're pretty much confirmed.</font>

102
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:54,968
<font color="yellow">I can't accept it.</font>

103
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,459
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have much work to do.</font>

104
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,067
<font color="yellow">You would just have to take up a spot
and help Seo Woo.</font>

105
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:02,180
<font color="yellow">I like this hospital and
I want to continue working here.</font>

106
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,819
<font color="yellow">Why don't you have any ambition?</font>

107
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,036
<font color="yellow">I like being a doctor,
a doctor who helps sick people.</font>

108
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,512
<font color="yellow">That's what I like.</font>

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,274
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Seo Woo today?</font>

110
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:15,031
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Bring her to the VIP patient room.</font>

111
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:17,790
<font color="yellow">You know that Congressman Na has
been admitted into the hospital, right?</font>

112
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,269
<font color="yellow">She should get acquainted with him.</font>

113
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:23,125
<font color="yellow">You have to do things you don't want to
for the sake of your parents.</font>

114
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,884
<font color="yellow">No matter how much freedom
Chairman Jung has given you...</font>

115
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:41,408
<font color="yellow">You look very tired.</font>

116
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:43,072
<font color="yellow">That's how it is for first years.</font>

117
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:45,461
<font color="yellow">If you get through it,
the second year will be much better.</font>

118
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:46,560
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

119
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:51,016
<font color="yellow"><i>[VIP Nurse]</i>
Gosh, he's calling me so often.</font>

120
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:54,257
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll be up soon.</font>

121
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:58,067
<font color="yellow">- Is it that congressman?
- Yes.</font>

122
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,586
<font color="yellow">Go change the dressing on Lee Jin Joo,
check her mental state, and chart it.</font>

123

but you're here, Doctor Hong.</font>

129
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:27,346
<font color="yellow">Then let's do rounds.</font>

130
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:32,035

134
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:44,278
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm still in a lot of pain.
Are you giving me the proper painkillers?</font>

<font color="yellow">- Are you controlling his pain properly?
- Yes.</font>

136
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,334
<font color="yellow">If he continues to complain,
add on NSAIDs.</font>

137
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:50,408
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

138
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:51,766
<font color="yellow">We're not going to do surgery?</font>

139
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,574
<font color="yellow">Surgery won't be necessary.</font>

140
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,060
<font color="yellow">Tests showed that your disc issues
are not severe.</font>

141
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,410

then discharge you in one week.</font>

142
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,430
<font color="yellow">How can it be so simple?</font>

143
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,598
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're correct?</font>

144
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:04,649
<font color="yellow">It is correct.</font>

145
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,379

146

since you're here?</font>

148
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,932
<font color="yellow">Let's talk a little.</font>

149
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:15,439
<font color="yellow">I would like to observe the lives of
people while I'm here in the hospital.</font>

150
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,663
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

More than 100 million won?</font>

152
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,120
<font color="yellow">Not as much as you would think.</font>

153
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,690
<font color="yellow">Should I speak to someone on your behalf?</font>

154
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,738
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

155
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,306
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

156
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,913
<font color="yellow">Oh, you were here, Doctor Yoo?</font>

157
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:57,524
<font color="yellow">How is Congressman Nam?</font>

158
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:59,625
<font color="yellow">He's fine. I'll be going. then.</font>

159
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:08,368
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo is good in the workplace.
She has the natural disposition for it.</font>

160
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,681
<font color="yellow">You already managed to escape?</font>

161
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,919
<font color="yellow">I wasn't saying anything,
so he told me to go.</font>

162
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,802
<font color="yellow">I should go with Kang Soo next time.</font>

163
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:21,859
<font color="yellow">You could do that.</font>

164
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,913
<font color="yellow">He'll be discharged in a few days,
so wait a little bit.</font>

165
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:26,883
<font color="yellow">I am. I have to make a living, don't I?</font>

166
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:27,938
<font color="yellow">You've grown up a lot.</font>

167
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,261
<font color="yellow">I'm all grown up, actually.</font>

168
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:31,841
<font color="yellow">Oh! Have you had your vitamin D today?</font>

169
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:32,923
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

170
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:34,745
<font color="yellow">I like people who are dedicated.</font>

171
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:37,243
<font color="yellow">If you start something,
you should see it through to the end.</font>

172
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,424
<font color="yellow">What about the antioxidant?</font>

173
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:39,479
<font color="yellow">You're nagging.</font>

174
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:41,732
<font color="yellow">I'm still healthy.
You don't need to take care of me.</font>

175
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,904
<font color="yellow">Still, you're nine years older than me.</font>

176
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:46,176
<font color="yellow">I don't want you dying before I do.</font>

177
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:47,899
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly bringing up death?</font>

178
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,572
<font color="yellow">It's not sudden.</font>

179
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:53,812
<font color="yellow">People whom I love can't die before I do.</font>

180
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,144
<font color="yellow">You have to do that for me.</font>

181
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:00,283
<font color="yellow">How is Lee Hae Young doing?</font>

182
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:02,482
<font color="yellow">Should we go check on her now?</font>

183
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:29,573
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm finally wearing a wedding dress.</i></font>

184
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:31,519
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

185
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,571
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

186
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,594
<font color="yellow">Our baby.</font>

187
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:39,220
<font color="yellow">I wanted us to get the formalities
over with before our baby is born.</font>

188
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,899
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry... and thank you.</font>

189
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,190
<font color="yellow">No, it was harder for you.</font>

190
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,842
<font color="yellow">You were always working
and getting our house ready.</font>

191
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:51,363
<font color="yellow">We'll get married and have our baby.</font>

192
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,363
<font color="yellow">We only have happiness in our future.</font>

193
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,980
<font color="yellow">Honey, I love you.</font>

194
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,548
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to say it back to me?</font>

195
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,192
<font color="yellow">I said I love you!</font>

196
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:32,907
<font color="yellow">Vitals?</font>

197
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:34,950
<font color="yellow">Systolic blood pressure
has stabilized at 120.</font>

198
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,326
<font color="yellow">Her body temperature is between
36 to 37 degrees Celsius.</font>

199
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,517
<font color="yellow">I know it's a lot of work,
but check on her often.</font>

200
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:42,595
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

201
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:56,423
<font color="yellow">Hey. Keep her temperature
and BP at a normal level.</font>

202
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,764
<font color="yellow">Do labs every day to check on
her hormone levels.</font>

203
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:01,886
<font color="yellow">Make a note if there are any changes.</font>

204
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:04,754
<font color="yellow">- Get obstetrics to come daily too.
- Okay.</font>

205
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:07,903
<font color="yellow">You two work really well together.</font>

206
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:11,047
<font color="yellow">What is that supposed to mean?</font>

207
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:13,187
<font color="yellow">What? It doesn't mean anything.</font>

208
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:14,979
<font color="yellow">You're being absurd.</font>

209
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:18,618
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

210
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:27,207
<font color="yellow">How long must she live
for the baby to survive?</font>

211
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:32,881
<font color="yellow">The baby has a higher chance to live if
we can incubate the baby at 24 weeks.</font>

212
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,198
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

213
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:38,085
<font color="yellow">it wouldn't be a surprise to anyone</font>

214
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:40,258
<font color="yellow">if the patient couldn't survive
even 10 minutes.</font>

215
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:49,875
<font color="yellow">I regret it so much, Doctor.</font>

216
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,605
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself.</font>

217
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:56,461
<font color="yellow">You're doing very well.</font>

218
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:57,621
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

219
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:02,678
<font color="yellow">I never told her that I loved her.</font>

220
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,610
<font color="yellow">That's what I regret the most.</font>

221
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,629
<font color="yellow">I thought that words were so precious.</font>

222
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,158
<font color="yellow">I was going to do it at the wedding
during my vows.</font>

223
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:26,823
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she knows how you feel.</font>

224
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,969
<font color="yellow">She's fighting with her dying breath
to protect the baby.</font>

225
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,938
<font color="yellow"><i>Where are you?</i></font>

226
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:52,884
<font color="yellow"><i>Going to the fellow room.</i></font>

227
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:57,842
<font color="yellow"><i>Stop and don't move.</i></font>

228
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,894
<font color="yellow"><i>[Stop and don't move.]</i></font>

229
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:50,355
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

230
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,690
<font color="yellow">I've never told you, have I?</font>

231
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:55,385
<font color="yellow">Told me what?</font>

232
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:03,792
<font color="yellow">I love you, Hye Jung.</font>

233
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:09,866
<font color="yellow">You ran here to tell me that?</font>

234
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:11,005
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

235
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,207
<font color="yellow">No matter when or what the situation,
I didn't want to end up regretting it.</font>

236
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,431
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

237
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:58,751
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't keep doing this
in the hospital.</font>

238
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,505
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you doing it?</font>

239
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:11,317
<font color="yellow">Doing what?</font>

240
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:15,135
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to say it.</font>

241
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:16,774
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

242
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,745
<font color="yellow">They're such precious words.
I don't want to say them out loud yet.</font>

243
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:26,288
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung.</font>

244
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,448
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do that assignment later.</font>

245
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:36,663
<font color="yellow">I won't be seeing you again today.</font>

246
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,846
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

247
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,326
<font color="yellow">Doctor Pi, where did
Doctor Ahn Joong Dae run away to?</font>

248
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:01,406
<font color="yellow">It's a big mystery.</font>

249
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,996
<font color="yellow">I worried about him for no reason.</font>

250
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,594
<font color="yellow">Lee Mi Ja is on painkillers, right?</font>

251
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:09,873
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Increase by half an ampoule.</font>

252
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:11,663
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

253
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,157
<font color="yellow">Young Gook.</font>

254
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,078
<font color="yellow">I thought about it.</font>

255
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,990
<font color="yellow">Why? Were you feeling conflicted
after the bad thing I did?</font>

256
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,281
<font color="yellow">A little.</font>

257
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:34,799
<font color="yellow">I don't want to ask about your feelings.
I'm the important one here.</font>

258
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:38,263
<font color="yellow">I want us to continue being friends.</font>

259
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:40,382
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

260
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:45,021
<font color="yellow">No... I just changed my mind.</font>

261
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,057
<font color="yellow">I'm suddenly curious about your feelings.</font>

262
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,299
<font color="yellow">I don't want to tell you.</font>

263
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,569
<font color="yellow">We're just friends, anyway.</font>

264
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:56,612
<font color="yellow">Friends.</font>

265
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:22,259
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

266
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:30,835
<font color="yellow">You don't give up, do you?</font>

267
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,390
<font color="yellow">Aren't you tired of
hearing the same thing?</font>

268
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,617
<font color="yellow">That's why I brought something new.</font>

269
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,990
<font color="yellow">I noticed you accessed
my grandma's medical files.</font>

270
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,150
<font color="yellow">This was before they were destroyed.</font>

271
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,406
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

272
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:58,009
<font color="yellow">You have the anesthesiology
records, don't you?</font>

273
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,690
<font color="yellow">Why would I have those?</font>

274
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,909
<font color="yellow">If you had no intentions of keeping them</font>

275
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,263
<font color="yellow">why did you open and access files
of a surgery that happened 10 years ago?</font>

276
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,710
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything better to do?</font>

277
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:13,633
<font color="yellow">Even if you tell me,
no one's life is going to change.</font>

278
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,339
<font color="yellow">It's legally too late to do anything.</font>

279
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:20,773
<font color="yellow">You would just be telling me
as a fellow doctor.</font>

280
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,575
<font color="yellow">Give me time to think about it.</font>

281
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:36,799
<font color="yellow">Joong Dae...
Gosh, my head hurts. Can you...</font>

282
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:46,104
<font color="yellow">My head, my head...</font>

283
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:57,500
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo, what are you looking for?</font>

284
00:19:58,214 --> 00:19:59,884
<font color="yellow">Acetaminophen.</font>

285
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,958
<font color="yellow">You seem to get headaches often.</font>

286
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,961
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

287
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,729
<font color="yellow">I just don't like it
even if hurts a little.</font>

288
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:08,119
<font color="yellow">I take medicine if it hurts a little
or even if it seems like it will hurt.</font>

289
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:11,489
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you can't handle pain.</font>

290
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,182
<font color="yellow">Move aside.</font>

291
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:14,979
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

292
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,597
<font color="yellow">- Here it is.
- Thank you.</font>

293
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:20,818
<font color="yellow">Water.</font>

294
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,423
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

295
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,228
<font color="yellow">Okay. All better.</font>

296
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,729
<font color="yellow">Young Gook!</font>

297
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,787
<font color="yellow">I'm here to pick up
what I ordered yesterday.</font>

298
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:38,909
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes.</font>

299
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:44,044
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

300
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,394
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

301
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:48,365
<font color="yellow">Wow! Joong Dae, you're studying hard.</font>

302
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:49,990
<font color="yellow">You'll become a professor.</font>

303
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,871
<font color="yellow">Studying like this for 100 days
won't help you get high grades.</font>

304
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,700
<font color="yellow">You need to get good study notes.</font>

305
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:58,041
<font color="yellow">- Young Gook, do you have study notes?
- No.</font>

306
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,165
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to study?</font>

307
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:02,363
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do well on the test.
It doesn't really matter.</font>

308
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:03,891
<font color="yellow">I'll suffer through the embarrassment.</font>

309
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:07,529
<font color="yellow">I'm so hungry. Order some food.</font>

310
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,767
<font color="yellow">Uh... that won't be on the test.</font>

311
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,030
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

312
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,368
<font color="yellow">When did our department
get so cold and fickle?</font>

313
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:20,924
<font color="yellow">You guys are hungry, right?</font>

314
00:21:20,924 --> 00:21:24,009
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! What is this? Wow!</font>

315
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,144
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

316
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:28,529
<font color="yellow">Hey, eat.</font>

317
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,476
<font color="yellow">Wow! It looks so good.</font>

318
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,402
<font color="yellow">Wow, is it some sort of special day?</font>

319
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:33,633
<font color="yellow">I was hungry so this is great.</font>

320
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:36,962
<font color="yellow">This must be about Professor Hong.
Do you have a rivalry with him?</font>

321
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,112
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how to accept things
with a pure heart?</font>

322
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,892
<font color="yellow">I am very sorry.</font>

323
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:43,488
<font color="yellow">It looks so delicious.</font>

324
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:45,778
<font color="yellow">I think I need to lie down.</font>

325
00:21:45,778 --> 00:21:47,400
<font color="yellow">This is a historical day.</font>

326
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,718
<font color="yellow">Doctor Jung's buying us food
after my three years here.</font>

327
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:51,306
<font color="yellow">Hey, you guys are really funny.</font>

328
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:54,051
<font color="yellow">Didn't I pay for us when we
went to hospital outings?</font>

329
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,627
<font color="yellow">- I don't recall that.
- Neither do I.</font>

330
00:21:56,627 --> 00:22:00,098
<font color="yellow">I think I might remember if I eat this.</font>

331
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:02,170
<font color="yellow">This is getting more
and more interesting.</font>

332
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,991
<font color="yellow">What? What do you want to eat?</font>

333
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,090
<font color="yellow">You pigs. Round face, one and two.</font>

334
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:10,577
<font color="yellow">Round face? Who is one?</font>

335
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:12,284
<font color="yellow">One... and two.</font>

336
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:14,546
<font color="yellow">That hurts, that hurts...</font>

337
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:17,066
<font color="yellow">Don't hit Joong Dae.
He's going to leave again.</font>

338
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,193
<font color="yellow">I get tired when he's gone.</font>

339
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:20,653
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'll be two. You're right.</font>

340
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,939
<font color="yellow">We really are round though.</font>

341
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,824
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I help you with something?</i></font>

342
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:42,682
<font color="yellow">No, don't do a thing.</font>

343
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:57,857
<font color="yellow">I get to eat the first thing
Yoo Hye Jung has ever cooked.</font>

344
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,527
<font color="yellow">Are you testing it out on me
before you give it to Teacher Hong?</font>

345
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:05,820
<font color="yellow">Are you watching a different
genre of TV dramas lately?</font>

346
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,998
<font color="yellow">Things with conspiracies,
lies, and deceit in them.</font>

347
00:23:08,998 --> 00:23:11,009
<font color="yellow">You sure hold a grudge.</font>

348
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:16,233
<font color="yellow">Doctor Ahn Joong Dae was asking me
to hide him, so what could I do?</font>

349
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,320
<font color="yellow">He had nowhere to go.</font>

350
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,528
<font color="yellow">Do you take in everyone
with nowhere to go?</font>

351
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,557
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

352
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:25,423
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's been so long
since I've had time like this.</font>

353
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,310
<font color="yellow">Did something good happen today?</font>

354
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,375
<font color="yellow">I feel more relaxed
about my life these days.</font>

355
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,741
<font color="yellow">Teacher Hong has accomplished a lot.</font>

356
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,611
<font color="yellow">How could I be here today
if I didn't have you?</font>

357
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:41,400
<font color="yellow">I feel the same way.</font>

358
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,340
<font color="yellow">I think things might work out
with my grandma too.</font>

359
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,295
<font color="yellow">I think a doctor who was in the
operating room might talk to me.</font>

360
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:50,070
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo came and asked me about it.</font>

361
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,151
<font color="yellow">She asked me if I knew why
you were at Gookil Hospital.</font>

362
00:23:54,352 --> 00:23:56,521
<font color="yellow">I told her that I didn't know why.</font>

363
00:23:56,521 --> 00:24:01,030
<font color="yellow">How can I tell her that her dad
led the surgery on your grandma?</font>

364
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,109
<font color="yellow">I couldn't say that to her.</font>

365
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,901
<font color="yellow">Cheon Soon Hee, I like you so much.</font>

366
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:11,865
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung, I like you so much too.</font>

367
00:24:14,116 --> 00:24:15,821
<font color="yellow">But, you know...</font>

368
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,000
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bring up your grandma to you.</font>

369
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:24,558
<font color="yellow">So, I had hoped that you would find
happiness with Teacher Hong.</font>

370
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,878
<font color="yellow">Then I thought that you would
forget about your grandma.</font>

371
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,348
<font color="yellow">You didn't, though.</font>

372
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:33,269
<font color="yellow">My grandma is my grandma and
Doctor Hong is Doctor Hong.</font>

373
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:36,353
<font color="yellow">He's actually helping me out with this.</font>

374
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,441
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I think we need to
get divorced now.</font>

375
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:42,887
<font color="yellow">We've lived together for too long.</font>

376
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:50,118
<font color="yellow">Still... you look happy, so I'm happy.</font>

377
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:51,877
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

378

380
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,006

to Kim Tae Soo?</font>

381
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,924

- As for pain... hold on.</font>

385
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,369
<font color="yellow">It's my younger brother in the army.</font>

386

<font color="yellow">Are you doing okay?</font>

389
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:28,223
<font color="yellow">I'm so busy that I had
no time to go visit you.</font>

390
00:25:31,204 --> 00:25:33,673
<font color="yellow">You were given an explanation
of the surgery, right?</font>

391
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:34,726
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

392
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,118
<font color="yellow">Your arm has good strength too.
Don't worry too much.</font>

393
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:42,788
<font color="yellow">Get a central line in</font>

394
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:45,608
<font color="yellow">and we'll need to go to the ICU
after surgery, so prepare for that.</font>

395
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:46,755
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

VVIP patient during your surgery?</font>

399
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,769
<font color="yellow">I have to say it's okay even if it's not.</font>

400

I hope he hasn't gotten worse.</font>

401
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,700

They'd call Professor Hong then.</font>

00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:32,256
<font color="yellow">It hurts everywhere.</font>

407
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:37,276
<font color="yellow">You can't tell me in such vague terms.
You need to tell me more details.</font>

You can give me the shot, Doctor Yoo.</font>

Can you keep an eye on him for me?</font>

00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:12,222
<font color="yellow">It's Kang Soo. I called for him.</font>

603
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:13,572
<font color="yellow">I had some questions for him.</font>

604
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,148
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

605
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,693
<font color="yellow">We need to know all the facts
to have a countermeasure.</font>

606
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:26,983
<font color="yellow">That's my theory.</font>

607
00:42:26,983 --> 00:42:29,090
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's sort things out.</font>

608
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:31,648
<font color="yellow">There's some empty time.</font>

609
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:34,936
<font color="yellow">The VIP nurse called Doctor Jin.</font>

610
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:36,670
<font color="yellow">She couldn't reach her,
so she called Doctor Yoo.</font>

611
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,599
<font color="yellow">She couldn't reach Doctor Yoo.
She called you, Kang Soo.</font>

612
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,306
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you go up
when you got the call?</font>

613
00:42:41,306 --> 00:42:43,103
<font color="yellow">That's the thing...</font>

614
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:45,427
<font color="yellow">That's the thing that's driving me crazy.</font>

615
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:48,498
<font color="yellow">I never got a call from the VIP nurse.</font>

616
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:50,384
<font color="yellow">- Kang Soo.
- Yes?</font>

617
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:52,634
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to criticize you.</font>

618
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:54,764
<font color="yellow">This issue isn't about one person.</font>

619
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:57,492
<font color="yellow">A Neurosurgery fellow and
residents are all involved in this.</font>

620
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,132
<font color="yellow">We all need to survive.</font>

621
00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:05,253
<font color="yellow">I'm really telling the truth here.</font>

622
00:43:12,878 --> 00:43:14,503
<font color="yellow"><i>[Choi Kang Soo]</i></font>

623
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,436
<font color="yellow">Wow! Is a ghost playing tricks on me?</font>

624
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:21,047
<font color="yellow">She really did call me.</font>

625
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:23,896
<font color="yellow">She did call you.</font>

626
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:26,199
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you she didn't.
It has to be an error.</font>

627
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:29,757
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look at mine.</font>

628

631
00:43:45,614 --> 00:43:46,724
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

632
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:51,293
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong with your brain?
How come you can't remember?</font>

633
00:43:54,574 --> 00:43:56,224
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

634
00:43:56,856 --> 00:43:59,009
<font color="yellow">I will go and tell them.</font>

635
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:00,655
<font color="yellow">No, I'm responsible for it.</font>

636
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:02,876
<font color="yellow">He was a patient assigned to me.</font>

637
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:04,936
<font color="yellow">There's nothing you should be
held responsible for.</font>

00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,217
<font color="yellow"><i>[Director's Office]</i></font>

639
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,882
<font color="yellow">This is Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

00:44:18,882 --> 00:44:20,871
<font color="yellow"><i>The director would like to see you.</i></font>

641
00:44:28,976 --> 00:44:31,347
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about what happened today.</font>

642
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:33,998
<font color="yellow">I'll take responsibility for it.</font>

643
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:35,347
<font color="yellow">I like that attitude.</font>

644
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:40,367
<font color="yellow">You'll come before the disciplinary
committee and will be held responsible.</font>

645
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:45,626
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you may think,
but this is the kind of person I am.</font>

646
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:47,934
<font color="yellow">I am reasonable and generous.</font>

647
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:50,376
<font color="yellow">I let you off once before.</font>

648
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,842
<font color="yellow">Not this time.</font>

649
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:55,315
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

650
00:45:10,286 --> 00:45:12,847
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- What happened?</font>

651
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:18,894
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo will be getting disciplined.</font>

652
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:20,547
<font color="yellow">I can't shield her.</font>

653
00:45:20,547 --> 00:45:23,900
<font color="yellow">All of the fellows and residents of
our department are mixed up in it.</font>

654
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,554
<font color="yellow">They need a sacrificial lamb.</font>

655
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:26,726
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

656
00:45:27,235 --> 00:45:29,445
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo was his doctor.</font>

657
00:45:29,445 --> 00:45:32,081
<font color="yellow">Even if he wasn't critical,
she shouldn't have been careless.</font>

658
00:45:32,844 --> 00:45:35,914
<font color="yellow">Or she should have put him in the care
of someone she could trust.</font>

659
00:45:35,914 --> 00:45:37,914
<font color="yellow">You can't allow a disciplinary committee.</font>

660
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:41,099
<font color="yellow">If this goes to the committee,
it will disgrace her name as a doctor.</font>

661
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,661
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I know that?</font>

662
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,027
<font color="yellow">But I can't make this into a
Neurosurgery department issue.</font>

663
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:58,351
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming from that direction?</font>

664
00:45:58,351 --> 00:46:00,309
<font color="yellow">Are you coming from
the fellow room?</font>

665
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:01,440
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

666
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,690
<font color="yellow">Were you comforting Hye Jung?</font>

667
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,485
<font color="yellow">If I can be a source of comfort...</font>

668
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,681
<font color="yellow">Why would you bother doing
something so pointless?</font>

669
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,231
<font color="yellow">You can do that for 100 days.
She'll only love Hong Ji Hong.</font>

670
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:13,626
<font color="yellow">It's love because I'm doing
pointless things.</font>

671
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:16,050
<font color="yellow">Did you always have
this naive side to you?</font>

672
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,192
<font color="yellow">I did. It was just in a
deep sleep inside my heart.</font>

673
00:46:19,192 --> 00:46:22,347
<font color="yellow">Whatever, I don't know.
I don't care about Doctor Yoo's problems.</font>

674
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,152
<font color="yellow">You are really a sad sight.</font>

675
00:46:24,152 --> 00:46:27,896
<font color="yellow">Don't you hate Hye Jung?
She won't even accept your feelings.</font>

676
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:31,989
<font color="yellow">I'm doing what I feel and
Doctor Yoo is doing what she feels.</font>

677
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,797
<font color="yellow">We're both just following our hearts.</font>

678
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:37,166
<font color="yellow">Well, aren't you just a saint?</font>

679
00:46:52,168 --> 00:46:53,510
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

680
00:46:59,177 --> 00:47:03,208
<font color="yellow">Isn't it wrong for Doctor Yoo to
take the blame all by herself?</font>

681
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,719
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

682
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:07,547
<font color="yellow">I wish Congressman Na Min Soo
would wake up.</font>

683
00:47:07,547 --> 00:47:09,996
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't, things could get
really problematic.</font>

684
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:11,577
<font color="yellow">Isn't this all unfair though?</font>

685
00:47:11,577 --> 00:47:14,364
<font color="yellow">How can anyone know about a hypertensive
brain hemorrhage until it happens?</font>

686
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,610
<font color="yellow">You only know when it happens.</font>

687
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:16,811
<font color="yellow">It doesn't show up in tests.</font>

688
00:47:16,811 --> 00:47:19,347
<font color="yellow">- How can anyone be held responsible?
- You're right.</font>

689
00:47:19,347 --> 00:47:20,920
<font color="yellow">They want people to be held
responsible for everything.</font>

690
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,675
<font color="yellow">- It should be fine if he recovers.
- Yeah.</font>

691
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:42,958
<font color="yellow">Just go to sleep, would you?</font>

692
00:47:49,652 --> 00:47:51,840
<font color="yellow">You seem to get headaches often.</font>

693
00:47:53,512 --> 00:47:54,690
<font color="yellow">Yes, Nurse.</font>

694
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,851
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong with your brain?
How come you can't remember?</font>

695
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:21,974
<font color="yellow">One shot, one shot, one shot!</font>

696
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:39,144
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Oh, hey! You're here?</font>

697
00:48:42,304 --> 00:48:44,364
<font color="yellow">I have a favor to ask.</font>

698
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,505
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

699
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,454
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

700
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:03,518
<font color="yellow">Professor.</font>

701
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:05,425
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo, what is it?</font>

702
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:08,300
<font color="yellow">I had something to ask you.
Do you have time?</font>

703
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,019
<font color="yellow">Yes, come sit down.</font>

704
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:15,222
<font color="yellow">These are my friend's CT and MRI scans.</font>

705
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:16,960
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you could take a look.</font>

706
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,521
<font color="yellow">He must have a doctor if he has CT scans.</font>

707
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,650
<font color="yellow">He's scared and very nervous.</font>

708
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,072
<font color="yellow">So, he wants to get second opinions
from other hospitals too.</font>

709
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:28,590
<font color="yellow">Can't you give your opinion?</font>

710
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:30,342
<font color="yellow">I can.</font>

711
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:32,420
<font color="yellow">It looks like a meningioma.</font>

712
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,068
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a meningioma
near the sphenoid bone.</font>

713
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:37,659
<font color="yellow">It's very large too.</font>

714
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:42,750
<font color="yellow">He's also experiencing absence seizures.</font>

715
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:45,539
<font color="yellow">He's been zoning out and blacking out.</font>

716
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:47,518
<font color="yellow">He's having trouble remembering things.</font>

717
00:50:47,518 --> 00:50:50,889
<font color="yellow">A meningioma along with absence seizures.
That's pretty unique.</font>

718
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,889
<font color="yellow">Tell him to get it treated quickly.
Is he a close friend of yours?</font>

719
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:28,219
<font color="yellow">I just saw Director Jin.</font>

720
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:31,056
<font color="yellow">This issue will proceed according to
the rules and procedure.</font>

721
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,664
<font color="yellow">I was going to go meet the director now.</font>

722
00:51:34,664 --> 00:51:37,786
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to make any
requests to him on my behalf.</font>

723
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:39,949
<font color="yellow">It's not because it's you.</font>

724
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:42,489
<font color="yellow">I would do it for anyone
who had to go through this.</font>

725
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:46,188
<font color="yellow">I would to protect my pride,
at least with him.</font>

726
00:51:48,262 --> 00:51:51,641
<font color="yellow">I was the congressman's doctor.
It is my fault.</font>

727
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:57,240
<font color="yellow">I met with Section Chief Kim Chi Hyun.
He was different than before.</font>

728
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,614
<font color="yellow">I have hope that I can resolve my
grandma's issue soon.</font>

729
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:03,753
<font color="yellow">Good. That's a relief.</font>

730
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:07,579
<font color="yellow">To a person who likes
rules and procedures</font>

731
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:10,266
<font color="yellow">I want to deal with him in that same way.</font>

732
00:52:11,974 --> 00:52:14,226
<font color="yellow">I want you to just to watch over me.</font>

733
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:17,019
<font color="yellow">Watch how I deal with it instead.</font>

734
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:19,161
<font color="yellow">It's not so easy for me.</font>

735
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:24,168
<font color="yellow">Not doing anything in this situation
is very hard for me.</font>

736
00:52:28,751 --> 00:52:31,027
<font color="yellow">What did I say you should do
in times like this?</font>

737
00:52:31,728 --> 00:52:33,737
<font color="yellow">I know I taught you.</font>

738
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:37,186
<font color="yellow">I can't do it here.</font>

739
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:40,708
<font color="yellow">We can find a place
where we can be alone.</font>

740
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,065
<font color="yellow">Doctor...</font>

741
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:09,989
<font color="yellow">You're right. Someone might come.</font>

742
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:20,463
<font color="yellow"><i>Congressman Na Min Soo has received
surgery from a brain hemorrhage.</i></font>

743
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,422
<font color="yellow"><i>He is currently unconsciousness.</i></font>

744
00:53:23,422 --> 00:53:26,382

<font color="yellow">What is Congressman Na's illness
and what are his symptoms?</font>

750
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:39,271
<font color="yellow">He had a hypertensive brain hemorrhage.</font>

751
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:42,231
<font color="yellow">His capillaries and veins were
being damaged for a long time.</font>

752
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:45,291
<font color="yellow">The blood vessels could no longer
withstand the pressure and ruptured.</font>

753
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:49,005
<font color="yellow">It was not caused by any external factor.
It was a brain hemorrhage.</font>

754
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:52,822
<font color="yellow">What state is he in right now?</font>

755
00:53:52,822 --> 00:53:54,291
<font color="yellow">Is there a chance he will wake up?</font>

756
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:56,152
<font color="yellow">The surgery was a success.</font>

757
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:58,041
<font color="yellow">We are checking his progress.</font>

758
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:01,501
<font color="yellow">You say that,
but he is still unconscious.</font>

759
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:04,186
<font color="yellow">That is common for patients
who have had brain surgery.</font>

760
00:54:04,186 --> 00:54:08,034
<font color="yellow">I cannot give you a
conclusive statement right now.</font>

761
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:09,202
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

762
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:34,298
<font color="yellow">He's gone from a semi-coma to a stupor.</font>

763
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:43,264
<font color="yellow">Now it's done.</font>

764
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:47,543
<font color="yellow">Check his vitals often
and change his dressing.</font>

765
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:52,380
<font color="yellow">He should be okay now.</font>

766
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,099
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

767
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:55,762
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

768
00:54:55,762 --> 00:54:58,771
<font color="yellow">I'll use this opportunity to set this
hospital on the right path again.</font>

769
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:01,130

of Doctor Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

770

<font color="yellow">Why did you call me?</font>

771
00:55:29,684 --> 00:55:32,775
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It's all my fault.</font>

772
00:55:32,775 --> 00:55:34,211
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

773
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:36,260
<font color="yellow">This should be happening to me.</font>

774
00:55:37,264 --> 00:55:39,025
<font color="yellow">I'll take responsibility for everything.</font>

775
00:55:40,434 --> 00:55:42,927
<font color="yellow">Do you think just anyone can take
responsibility for things?</font>

776
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:46,483
<font color="yellow">It's because it's me that I can do it.
I'm kind of great.</font>

777
00:55:49,773 --> 00:55:53,673
<font color="yellow">Even the way you comfort people
is on a different level.</font>

778
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:56,583
<font color="yellow">Thanks for recognizing
that I was comforting you.</font>

779
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:58,099
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

785

I was in your dream?</font>
