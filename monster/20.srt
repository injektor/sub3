1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,850
In Dodo Group's...

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,250
Strategic Planning Department...

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,700
is a man called Byun Il Jae.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,350
He's Congressman Hwang's son-in-law.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,680
I was investigating him for embezzlement...

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,070
when I realised that money...

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,420
was going from him to Congressman Hwang.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,640
That is how I first found out about...

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,380
the deep-set corruption surrounding the defence industry.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,350
Gun Woo betrayed you.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,550
Sir.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,420
Sir.

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,350
What is going on?

14
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,480
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,630
No! Don't come to me!

16
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,920
I didn't do it! I did nothing wrong!

17
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,220
Go away!

18
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,640
I didn't do it.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,550
It wasn't me.

20
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,970
Can a person suddenly become schizophrenic?

21
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,080
It may happen when one is exposed with severe impact.

22
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,610
- When will he be diagnosed?
 -  We'll begin as soon as...

23
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,820
he calms down.

24
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,400
It's not me. I didn't do it.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,180
Please, no.

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
No.

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,340
Congressman Hwang, please say something.

28
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,540
What is your relationship with the defence industry?

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,780
Do you agree with...

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,540
- Get these reporters away.
 -  the given charge?

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,710
- Sir, please.
 -  Say something.

32
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,520
- Congressman.
 -  Say something.

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,230
Is it true that you are Chairman Do Choong's second son?

34
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,510
Please say a word about these rumours.

35
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,940
We won't take any private questions.

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,950
Please move.

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,420
I'm sorry, please move away.

38
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,220
Great job, Vice Chairman Do.

39
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,650
Forget about everything else...

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,700
and just focus on keeping the company profitable.

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,780
Yes,

42
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
Father.

43
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,650
What did he say?

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,610
Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo, who exposed this incident, was...

45
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,410
the second son...

46
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,350
- of Chairman Do Choong.
 -  Idiots.

47
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,120
Mum! Why are you taking this out on me?

48
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,720
My goodness!

49
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,640
There are rumours that Do Gun Woo will become...

50
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,310
a candidate for the next chairman in place of Do Gwang Woo,

51
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,340
who's serving a sentence for creating slush fund.

52
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,720
Do Gun Woo that scumbag!

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,880
Darn it!

54
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,910
Let go of me!

55
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,770
I'm going to kill him! Do Gun Woo!

56
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,710
Let go of me!

57
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,280
Let go!

58
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,940
What happened?

59
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,670
What do you mean that he's mentally ill?

60
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,220
He was shocked deeply after watching the hearing.

61
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,420
You should see him.

62
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,180
Are you sure Il Jae turned crazy?

63
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,120
We'll see when the results are out.

64
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,710
What about Choong Dong?

65
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,940
We searched his place and anywhere he might go to,

66
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,050
but there's no sign of him.

67
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,580
Why hasn't he shown himself to Il Jae?

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
It's weird.

69
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,550
I asked Cha Woo to check on the departure list with immigration.

70
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,250
Don't worry.

71
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,090
In Il Jae's state, nothing will change even if Choong Dong shows up.

72
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,010
Don't come near me! It's not my fault!

73
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,090
Don't come near me!

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,670
Honey, it's me. What's wrong with you?

75
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,810
- Don't come near me!
 -  Be careful, he's dangerous.

76
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,120
Let me go! He's my husband.

77
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,920
Honey.

78
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,970
Honey, please put this down.

79
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,450
Don't be like this.

80
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,250
That's right. It's me, Ji Soo.

81
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,450
Your wife.

82
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,980
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,180
I didn't know you were suffering so much.

84
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,550
It's okay now.

85
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,420
I'll stay by your side.

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,220
- Die!
 -  Honey.

87
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,470
Do you think you can fool me? You can't trick me!

88
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,080
- Die!
 -  Honey!

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,120
Die! Die!

90
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,510
Die! Die!

91
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,080
- Honey...
 -  Die!

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,250
Honey.

93
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,520
The result is out.

94
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,480
It's worse than we thought.

95
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,420
Congresswoman Hwang.

96
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
It's okay.

97
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,610
How bad is it?

98
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,010
He will have to get treatment for at least a year.

99
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,950
Will he get better if he's treated?

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,280
Gi Tan, the result is out.

101
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,350
Il Jae has gone crazy for sure. It's serious.

102
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,380
The chairman plans on bringing you back to the office.

103
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,580
I won't be going back.

104
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,380
Do you still think...

105
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,450
you have more left to fight with Il Jae?

106
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,880
He's gone insane.

107
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,010
I don't know what it is, but...

108
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,150
No one knows when he'll be back to normal.

109
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,020
Jae Man...

110
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,750
is also looking for a way to get back, too.

111
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,310
When should the chairman expect you back?

112
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,350
Once this is all over,

113
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,820
I want to live an ordinary life.

114
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,050
- Ordinary?
 -  Yes.

115
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,050
I want to get married and have kids like everyone else.

116
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,050
I want to live my life...

117
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,920
appreciating the smallest things.

118
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,680
What do you think about Shin Young?

119
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,620
I think the chairman has you in mind for her.

120
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,580
I have someone I love.

121
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Of course.

122
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,050
Getting married to a rich girl...

123
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,450
is far from being ordinary.

124
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,670
Perfect timing. Get on.

125
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,110
I told you not to come.

126
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,520
What's the big deal? I was passing anyway.

127
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,180
- What is it?
 -  I think I saw Choong Dong.

128
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,420
He's in the United States.

129
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,410
Are you sure about that?

130
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,690
Cha Woo found his name on a flight to Los Angeles.

131
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,910
I'm sure it was him.

132
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,480
You're just tired. Go home and get some rest.

133
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,280
Why is he telling me to come over so early in the morning?

134
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,980
Wait a minute. He can't be...

135
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,750
Are you here?

136
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,750
What if he's trying to come onto me?

137
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
No way.

138
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,080
Why would Gun Woo do that to me?

139
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,420
No, you never know with men.

140
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,350
What should I do?

141
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,950
What are you doing in front of the door?

142
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,690
I won't go in.

143
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,180
Why not?

144
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,190
How can I go into a bachelor's place?

145
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,150
You're here already?

146
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,140
Did you sleep over last night?

147
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,050
Sleep? We worked all night.

148
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,480
I bought some burgers. Would you like one?

149
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,150
This is your schedule for the day.

150
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,540
My schedule?

151
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,180
You have back-to-back interviews with the media this afternoon.

152
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,580
Do you expect me to interview?

153
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,520
You had many interview requests.

154
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,620
We'll deal with the media aggressively now.

155
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,670
Hae Il wrote the manuscript last night,

156
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,680
so memorise it.

157
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,470
Hae Il, go to the office...

158
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,940
and gather up the new SPDs by 9am.

159
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,020
Yes, Sir.

160
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,080
Is it because you went to the United States? You're so pretty.

161
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,250
Thank you.

162
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,120
By the way, why is the vice chairman gathering us?

163
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,580
Why did he call for us?

164
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,450
Starting today,

165
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,780
you will be in charge of a special project.

166
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,740
We only have six months to bring our sales back to normal.

167
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,520
So get ready to work overtime.

168
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,350
The Secretary's Office...

169
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,050
will be in charge of reviewing all...

170
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,480
the affiliated companies.

171
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,770
You should focus on...

172
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,910
finding out the truth behind corruptions of suspected companies.

173
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,970
The Business Department...

174
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,010
Why is he acting like he works hard?

175
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,410
Why do you think? He's trying to get...

176
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,580
brownie points from the chairman.

177
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,340
Is he attempting to swallow the company whole?

178
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,680
Does he really want to fight?

179
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,020
Vice Chairman.

180
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,520
I need to talk to you.

181
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,180
I'm in a meeting. Why don't you come down?

182
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,180
Did he just give an order in front of the employees?

183
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,620
Just go shoot that commercial with Soo Yeon. What's with the act?

184
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,320
You're making a ruckus.

185
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,680
Tomorrow at this time, I'll expect you to report me the updates.

186
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,580
You're dismissed.

187
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,920
Don't move.

188
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,440
Let me say this as your supervising director.

189
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,870
I said, you're dismissed.

190
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,450
If any one of you move, you'll regret it.

191
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,320
Hey, you! Hey!

192
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,520
Those rats.

193
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,680
The chairman assigned me to be in charge of this project.

194
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,650
I won't ask for your help, so don't get in the way.

195
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,450
How dare they ignore me?

196
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,620
I'll kill them all.

197
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,210
You must have been heartbroken after getting fired.

198
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,870
Can you share how you felt?

199
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,870
Firstly, I would like to thank the chairman and my family...

200
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,550
at Dodo Group for reaching out to me first.

201
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,630
I heard you are in charge of product quality control, too.

202
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,110
Yes, I am taking part in product safety test.

203
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,940
I am watching them very closely,

204
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,520
so you may trust our product once again.

205
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,640
Does that mean recent products made by Dodo Group...

206
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,400
are safe to use?

207
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,120
Of course, you can trust them.

208
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,150
You're a good talker.

209
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,580
Your script was excellent.

210
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,270
- Are those your only clothes?
 -  Pardon?

211
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,880
You're wearing the same clothes for every interview.

212
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,880
Can't you think?

213
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,750
What can I do about my lack of clothes?

214
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,320
What time is our ad shooting at?

215
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,550
We have less than two hours left.

216
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,820
Only Soo Yeon will follow me.

217
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,820
I'll take everything on this rack in her size.

218
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,120
Are you getting all of these?

219
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,820
Pack up everything on this shelf in her size.

220
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,440
Gosh. Why did we get so many when we just need one?

221
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,220
Be quiet. I'm doing this for the company, not you.

222
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,580
- I'll return these later.
 -  Who'll take used clothes?

223
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,010
May I sell these, then?

224
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,650
Don't you dare sell them. I will find you.

225
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
That little...

226
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,820
People are our hope.

227
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,240
Us here at Dodo Group would like to open the door to the future...

228
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,390
with you all.

229
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,480
I love you.

230
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,680
Cut, that was good.

231
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,740
We'll keep that one and try once more.

232
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,750
Okay.

233
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,850
Wow, Soo Yeon looks so pretty.

234
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,650
She does.

235
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,380
Sung Ae, you're prettier.

236
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,230
You're embarrassing. Stop it.

237
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,280
Okay.

238
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,720
Hey, look at him.

239
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,950
Ready, action.

240
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,440
People are our hope.

241
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,010
Us here at Dodo Group would like to open the door to the future...

242
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,220
with you all.

243
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,380
I love you.

244
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,440
How is Gun Woo doing?

245
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,350
He's working overtime every day.

246
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,900
There are rumours in the company...

247
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,520
after he was exposed to the media.

248
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,470
What is it?

249
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,040
People say that he will become your successor...

250
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,910
if he successfully carries out this project.

251
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,050
You can take care...

252
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,310
of odd rumours like that.

253
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,530
Yes, Sir.

254
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,890
You may leave.

255
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,070
Is there a chance that he'll consider...

256
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,130
Gun Woo as his successor?

257
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,280
He likes competent people,

258
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,530
so there may be a chance.

259
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,980
That will have a huge impact.

260
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,120
The shareholders will take anyone who makes more profit,

261
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,350
but Ms Hwang is the problem.

262
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,050
How dare he try to put Gun Woo as his successor?

263
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,180
I hope...

264
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,420
you don't make a mistake.

265
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,320
I don't know how I would react.

266
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,550
Number 9077, you have a visitor.

267
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,450
Father.

268
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,110
What brings you here?

269
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,480
Why else would I be here...

270
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,680
if it wasn't for you?

271
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,920
I can't face you right now.

272
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,920
Please leave.

273
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,980
Do you blame me?

274
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,310
You reaped what you've sown.

275
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,280
You don't have the rights to blame anyone.

276
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,650
Why do you think I made that slush fund?

277
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,660
Do you think I made it only for my own sake?

278
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,680
Then what?

279
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,840
What were you going to do?

280
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,950
I was going to make...

281
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,580
connections with people in business and politics.

282
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,050
And I wanted to enlarge our business.

283
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,220
I was sick of hearing...

284
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,680
that I am incompetent...

285
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,550
from you.

286
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,680
That's exactly where you went wrong.

287
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,080
You don't know your place.

288
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,020
Whom do I take after?

289
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,980
I am your son.

290
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,780
I was born like this. What can I do?

291
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,440
You keep saying that I am incompetent, but that's me.

292
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,050
What can I do?

293
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,220
I did not...

294
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,890
wish for much.

295
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,680
I just wanted you...

296
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,580
to tell me that I did a good job.

297
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,020
Had you only said...

298
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,250
that you trusted me,

299
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,120
I wouldn't have turned out like this.

300
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,680
You are the one...

301
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,180
who made me into a criminal.

302
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,250
I...

303
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,320
respected you a lot.

304
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,350
Even when you were hard on me,

305
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,980
I believed you were a great man.

306
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
But...

307
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,450
I won't...

308
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,720
do that any more.

309
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,620
I will spend my years in here.

310
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,450
You can take Gun Woo...

311
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,450
and have your happy life.

312
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,120
You are my eldest son.

313
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,550
When something happens to the both of you,

314
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,180
I'll be hurt deeper with you.

315
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,680
That's because you are my first son...

316
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,820
and the eldest.

317
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,220
I don't care if you blame me or if you're angry at me.

318
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,220
When you come out,

319
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,350
I hope...

320
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,750
you will understand...

321
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,550
at least a little bit of my heart.

322
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,580
Don't turn on the lights, Guk Cheol.

323
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,650
I...

324
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,150
don't want to see my nephew's face.

325
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,320
You should have...

326
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,840
never returned,

327
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,080
Guk Cheol!

328
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,580
Il Jae,

329
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,620
you should just live the rest of your life as a lunatic.

330
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,720
Even if you wake up,

331
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,680
Jae Man won't be there to help you fulfil your ambition.

332
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,950
I will...

333
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,120
destroy everything.

334
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,940
Congressman Hwang must leave his post...

335
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,270
for deceiving people!

336
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,540
- Leave your post!
 -  Leave your post!

337
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,110
Congressman Hwang must leave post due to his corruptions!

338
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,410
- Leave your post!
 -  Leave your post!

339
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,940
- Hwang Jae Man must leave his post!
 -  Hwang Jae Man must leave his post!

340
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,370
A protest was held to demand Congressman Hwang Jae Man...

341
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,450
to leave his office after his corruption was exposed.

342
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,140
The special investigation bureau is determined to demolish...

343
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,410
all deep-set corruptions among the defence industry,

344
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,410
the army and the politicians.

345
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,470
Even under these accusations,

346
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,910
Congressman Hwang has not made a public appearance...

347
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,780
and is keeping silent.

348
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,420
(Kim Dae Woo)

349
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,150
- Yes.
 -  Where are you? Let's meet.

350
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,380
I'm a bit drunk.

351
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,340
I'll send you a car. Come over.

352
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,450
Also, be careful about being tailed.

353
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,210
Okay, what's your plan?

354
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,220
You know what I'm like.

355
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,220
Nothing can...

356
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,910
stop me from going my way.

357
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,850
That's what I wanted to say.

358
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,020
We've been through so much just trying...

359
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,220
to put you in the Blue House.

360
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,700
We went through thick and thin.

361
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,410
We've seen and done everything to get all the way here.

362
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,920
It'd be a waste to give up now.

363
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,120
I hear you're under investigation.

364
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,980
Make sure to hide a tail behind you.

365
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,080
Someone has to take the blame for you.

366
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm saying, be prepared...

367
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,420
to give away that tail when they get to you.

368
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,050
Were you ready to give away your tail?

369
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,250
All of my underlings are from the military.

370
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,020
No one will hesitate...

371
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,680
to go if I give them the order.

372
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,150
Which one are you planning...

373
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,350
to give up as your scapegoat?

374
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,720
Il Jae.

375
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,080
Il Jae.

376
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,450
Byun Il Jae?

377
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,680
You're going to make your son-in-law take the bullet?

378
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,550
I never got any money from you.

379
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,170
My son-in-law received it as an investment for his business.

380
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,150
I never gave you any money either.

381
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,510
My underling handed it over.

382
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,580
It seems like...

383
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,750
we can close things off here.

384
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,750
They won't be able to interrogate a madman.

385
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,650
You're extraordinary.

386
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,280
The problem is...

387
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,480
the impact I'll get as a politician.

388
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,940
People started to question my morals.

389
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,720
Don't mind them.

390
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,480
Don't you know?

391
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,650
People don't vote for candidates that are innocent.

392
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,350
The ones that are innocent are incompetent.

393
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,640
During war, a scar on your face...

394
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,210
shows your competence.

395
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,520
How will the citizens know what you're thinking?

396
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,820
They can only vote based on people's looks.

397
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,920
(Prosecution Services)

398
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,840
I'm Special Prosecutor Jung Han Soo.

399
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,120
All right. Let's get this over with.

400
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Follow me.

401
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,120
I'm not sure if the prosecutors will be able to handle him.

402
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,320
That prosecutor is a friend of mine.

403
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,010
He's a man of integrity. It'll be fine.

404
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,900
There are a lot of politicians trying to protect...

405
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,920
Jae Man.

406
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,840
Is it possible to get up-to-date progress on the investigation?

407
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,350
I'll talk to my friend and find out.

408
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,120
- Is he still keeping quiet?
 -  He finally opened his mouth,

409
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,230
but he says his son-in-law took it all as investment for his business.

410
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,570
His son-in-law is in a mental institute right now.

411
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,850
I know. That's why this is getting complicated.

412
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,140
The investigation won't end here, will it?

413
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,820
The chief prosecutor intends on interrogating himself, so we'll see.

414
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,720
You haven't been coming out to the reunions.

415
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,850
I finally get to see you here.

416
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,250
This is confidential. Turn the switch off.

417
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,510
How was dinner?

418
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,580
I had a few spoonful's of soup...

419
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,080
and now, I don't feel so good.

420
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,550
If you don't cooperate,

421
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,980
you'll feel worse.

422
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,880
Didn't the attorney general...

423
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,790
say anything to you?

424
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,840
He told me, "Good luck".

425
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,120
The investigation...

426
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,850
on the defence industry is finished.

427
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,150
The truth is out,

428
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,710
so what else do you need?

429
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,880
What we want...

430
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,350
isn't the tip of the iceberg.

431
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,080
We must know who received how much money as a bribe.

432
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,120
If you cooperate, I'll make sure...

433
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,350
you get the minimum number of years.

434
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,820
All right.

435
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,850
Write down what I tell you.

436
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,520
Park Gwang Soo, the attorney general.

437
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,370
Prime Minister Go Joon Tae.

438
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,150
Chief Secretary Lee Seok Goo.

439
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,520
Jang Min Gook, the minister of national defence.

440
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
What's wrong?

441
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,980
Is that pen out of ink?

442
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,320
I have about 30 more on my list.

443
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,820
Listen.

444
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,450
Do you know how far the roots...

445
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,780
of a 1000-year-old gingko tree can reach?

446
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,920
Its roots get tangled up with roots of other trees.

447
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,570
You'd have to cut down the oak, zelkova,

448
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,220
pine and the empress.

449
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,050
That's the only way you can pull out the gingko tree.

450
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,380
If you don't have the courage to dig up the mountain,

451
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,250
don't even dare think about holding onto an axe.

452
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,380
You should...

453
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
add your name on that list.

454
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,450
I've been paying for your alumni membership.

455
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,150
- Are you all right?
 -  I'm just tired.

456
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,880
- How is Il Jae?
 -  He's still looking bad.

457
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,780
I need to take a rest.

458
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,420
The congressmen...

459
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,350
have requested for your termination.

460
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,120
According to Congresswoman Hwang,

461
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,580
the party's leader told you to hang in there.

462
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,780
Schedule...

463
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,280
a press conference tomorrow.

464
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Due to my son-in-law's...

465
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,720
disgraceful acts,

466
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,920
we have raised so much concern in everyone.

467
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,980
We deeply apologise from the bottom of our hearts.

468
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:50,350
(Hanguk Party)

469
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,450
I will be taking full responsibility...

470
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,850
for what happened...

471
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,620
and will voluntarily resign from my position.

472
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,510
The resignation of the previous representative...

473
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,770
of the Hanguk Party, Congressman Hwang Jae Man,

474
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,920
influenced the running candidates for presidential election.

475
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,420
The Hanguk Party is holding an emergency meeting...

476
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,550
to deal with...

477
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,650
Honey.

478
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,350
What should I do?

479
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,050
There's nothing I can do by myself.

480
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,620
Wake up!

481
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,720
Il Jae!

482
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,020
Il Jae!

483
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,720
Please come back.

484
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,750
Please...

485
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,080
Il Jae is doomed.

486
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,280
Have someone keep an eye on him.

487
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,620
A care centre would work.

488
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,520
I'll find a place.

489
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,920
Your nose is bleeding. Tilt your head back.

490
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,220
It's dripping everywhere.

491
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,050
I'm not surprised. You barely sleep.

492
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,010
You stopped calling me "Sir".

493
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,180
Only because I was in shock.

494
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,300
Go home.

495
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,080
You can't...

496
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,790
Will you stay up, Sir?

497
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,950
Take a break.

498
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,080
You're acting like your life depends on this.

499
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,790
It does.

500
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,790
If I don't prove myself,

501
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,050
I lose a father, too.

502
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,350
I'm standing on a cliff's edge.

503
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,550
If I doze off, I fall and die.

504
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,320
Go home.

505
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,850
What?

506
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,290
Yes, Sir.

507
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,790
See you tomorrow.

508
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,010
- Hi, Gi Tan.
 -  Are you still at work?

509
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,380
I was just leaving.

510
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,300
Didn't you get my text?

511
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,850
I said I'd be late.

512
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,820
- Shall I pick you up?
 -  No thanks.

513
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,710
- Soo Yeon, I need to...
 -  I'm sorry,

514
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,250
but can we meet up tomorrow?

515
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,250
I'm not done working.

516
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,420
I feel bad leaving Gun Woo alone.

517
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,820
- Soo Yeon.
 -  Sorry, Gi Tan.

518
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,150
I need to earn my keep. I hope you understand.

519
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,120
I'll treat you to dinner tomorrow.

520
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,850
I'll call you.

521
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,520
I'm in the lobby. I'll wait until you're done.

522
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,720
I'll make the coffee.

523
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,470
Why are you back?

524
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,420
I want to claim overtime.

525
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,290
What coffee do you want?

526
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,350
The darker the better if you're going to stay up.

527
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,180
Don't you know what I like?

528
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,980
Do you not care about me?

529
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,120
I apologise.

530
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,010
Make a guess.

531
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,790
Not knowing your boss' taste means you're incompetent.

532
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,940
Concentrate on me.

533
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,050
Yes, Sir.

534
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,950
You should go home to change at least.

535
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,220
Gi Tan.

536
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,030
Why are you here?

537
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,290
Didn't you get my text?

538
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,320
Your text?

539
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,380
(I'm in the lobby. I'll wait until you're done.)

540
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,950
Were you here since then?

541
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,210
You should've called me.

542
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,020
Let's go. I'll take you home.

543
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,200
Let's not do this any more.

544
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,550
I feel terrible.

545
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,880
The sun will rise soon.

546
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,720
You wasted your time.

547
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,880
Jeong Eun, this is the first time we held hands.

548
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,850
It's so nice and warm.

549
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,790
Il Jae.

550
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,020
This lady will look after you from now on.

551
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,220
How are you?

552
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,090
Can you go to his room and change the sheets, please?

553
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,220
Of course.

554
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,620
She has a lot of experience. He will be in good hands.

555
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,350
Thank you, Gi Tan,

556
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,110
for helping us out during the tough times.

557
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,680
You need to stay strong.

558
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,480
You just have to figure out...

559
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,080
if he's faking it.

560
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,650
Okay.

561
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,840
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

562
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,880
Yes, Ma'am.

563
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,180
Fire that woman.

564
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,120
Gi Tan did this to us.

565
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,080
Don't say things like that.

566
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,290
I'm not crazy, Ji Soo.

567
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,320
Honey.

568
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,890
I'm pretending to be crazy...

569
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,750
to find out who betrayed us.

570
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,620
I'm sorry.

571
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,050
But I need you to understand.

572
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,450
What happened?

573
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,990
I met Choong Dong.

574
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,320
I am Congresswoman Hwang Ji Soo.

575
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,600
Before we begin the hearing, Congressman Hwang Jae Man,

576
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,650
the head of the committee, will give a speech.

577
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,420
Do you know how much...

578
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,160
Byun Il Jae speaking.

579
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,120
It's me, Choong Dong.

580
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,820
The men who kidnapped me...

581
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,470
are at your hospital.

582
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,650
Kidnapped?

583
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,410
By whom?

584
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,850
I have no time to explain.

585
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,380
Kang Gi Tan.

586
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,250
Beware of him.

587
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,720
Are you saying...

588
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,410
Gi Tan was behind all this?

589
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,910
If it wasn't me or Gun Woo,

590
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,120
who else knew all about our plans?

591
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,350
I'll try to visit you...

592
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,550
when they let their guards down.

593
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,820
They spoke Mandarin?

594
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,320
That's how they communicated.

595
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,380
Does Gi Tan have any Chinese contacts?

596
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,120
Ok Chae Ryung is a Chinese expat.

597
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,650
She was Jung Man Ok's secretary at Sudo Hospital.

598
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,150
I overheard Gi Tan mention the name "Cha Jeong Eun".

599
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,310
I'm thinking he could be Guk Cheol.

600
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,420
That's impossible.

601
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,420
You saw him fall into the water.

602
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,720
But we never found his body.

603
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,950
Gi Tan and Guk Cheol are two different people.

604
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,050
(Not the same person.)

605
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,620
Guk Cheol's blood is kept at Sudo Hospital.

606
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,150
Check if that sample has MK2 antibodies.

607
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,880
That's why you deceived me and pretended to be crazy?

608
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,550
He's slowly...

609
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,410
strangling us.

610
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,820
If we don't find out the truth and stop him, we'll all die...

611
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,780
just like Guk Cheol's parents and Man Ok did.

612
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,920
Mr Oh.

613
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,980
I have the results of Guk Cheol's blood.

614
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,570
(Blood Serum Test)

615
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,140
His blood sample doesn't have MK2 antibodies.

616
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,180
That means...

617
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,740
someone swapped out...

618
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,380
Guk Cheol's blood sample.

619
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,080
Kang Gi Tan is...

620
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,780
Lee Guk Cheol.

621
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,220
Lee Guk Cheol...

622
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,820
is still alive.

623
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,250
What should we do?

624
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,280
Listen to me carefully.

625
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,920
I am still crazy.

626
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,950
That will put him at ease.

627
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,110
The hospital director's in on it,

628
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,970
so you have to keep up the act.

629
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:18,020
Okay.

630
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,350
I will get rid of Gi Tan.

631
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,550
No.

632
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,420
You can't kill him until I get the 50 million...

633
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,170
he took from me.

634
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,940
We know who he is.

635
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,670
Why don't you force him to...

636
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,570
You know what he's capable of!

637
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,270
He duped me completely...

638
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,850
and ruined my father-in-law.

639
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,320
He even has the backing of an unknown Chinese triad.

640
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,080
If we touch him,

641
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,940
it will only backfire.

642
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,150
What will you do then?

643
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,210
I will use Gun Woo.

644
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,480
He already betrayed you to gain Chairman Do's affection.

645
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,420
That's why I'll use him.

646
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,950
I'll get rid of Guk Cheol...

647
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,080
and win Gun Woo back.

648
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,020
Will he side with you again?

649
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,480
I know him very well.

650
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,780
He will choose to work with me.

651
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,550
You can't visit Mr Byun today.

652
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,310
Is something wrong?

653
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,080
His condition worsened, so we isolated him.

654
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,340
Here, take this!

655
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,480
Take your money back!

656
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,740
- What's wrong?
 -  He is...

657
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,480
just too crazy.

658
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,010
I could do with the money,

659
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,080
but if I have to put up with him, forget it.

660
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,420
Hello, Gun Woo.

661
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,740
Drive to a quiet spot.

662
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,480
We need to talk.

663
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,220
So your attempt to buy the shares failed...

664
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,640
because of Gi Tan.

665
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,550
He has my money.

666
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,720
We need it...

667
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,550
if you're ever to take over Dodo Group.

668
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,120
Will you help?

669
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,850
What if I refuse?

670
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:58,020
Chairman Do is beginning to trust me.

671
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:02,420
I think I can take over the company without your help.

672
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,420
You can't do it without me for two reasons.

673
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,350
One, Gwang Woo will be released soon.

674
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,020
Once he gets out,

675
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,750
you won't have a free rein any more.

676
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,920
Because you were born from Do Choong's mistress.

677
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,850
You will feel the difference...

678
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,420
in how you're treated.

679
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,980
And the second reason?

680
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,680
Do you not regret killing your stepfather?

681
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,450
No, I don't.

682
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,280
Watch what you say.

683
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,980
Your life ends...

684
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,120
the second you're branded a killer.

685
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,650
I don't think what I did was murder.

686
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,320
He never was human to begin with.

687
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,350
In exchange for betraying me,

688
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,220
that recording will be sent to the press.

689
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,080
Chairman Do...

690
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,550
isn't merciful enough to accept a killer as his son.

691
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,080
Well?

692
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,780
That explains...

693
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:44,140
why you cannot do anything without my help.

694
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,150
Doesn't it?

695
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,150
It does.

696
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,340
When I saw you on TV, stabbing me in the back,

697
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,980
I prayed for you.

698
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,080
I prayed that you would gain Do Choong's utmost trust.

699
00:49:58,950 --> 00:49:59,950
That way,

700
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,580
we can create the world we dream of.

701
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,280
I want you to deal with Gi Tan.

702
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,420
Get back...

703
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,580
the money he took from me.

704
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,850
What then?

705
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,180
That is all...

706
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,450
that you need to do.

707
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,750
I'm glad that...

708
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,750
Gi Tan's the target.

709
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,340
- Gi Tan's here.
 -  Welcome.

710
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,480
How are you?

711
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,070
Not very well.

712
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,580
My family's a mess and my brother's in trouble.

713
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,520
You two should talk. I'll bring something to drink.

714
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:11,420
Have a seat.

715
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,510
I called you over today to ask...

716
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,020
a favour of you.

717
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,650
What is it?

718
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,380
Come back to work.

719
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,720
Gwang Woo's in prison and Il Jae was fired.

720
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:33,280
I can't stand the way things are going in Dodo Group.

721
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,670
I want you to go back...

722
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,580
and work for me.

723
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,280
- What must I do?
 -  It's Gun Woo.

724
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,650
He's running wild.

725
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,620
I want you to stop him.

726
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,880
If we let him be,

727
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,850
he might take over the company.

728
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,350
I heard that...

729
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,090
you were the only trainee who was able to beat him.

730
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:04,350
I need someone to rein in and tame the mad colt.

731
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,480
He's now a vice chairman...

732
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,150
and your husband's son.

733
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,550
There's Shin Young.

734
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,680
Use her.

735
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:21,150
You should be able to keep him in check.

736
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,020
If you need anything else, I will help as best I can.

737
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280
He's the reason...

738
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,750
our families are in shambles right now.

739
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,820
Please help us, Gi Tan.

740
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,820
For poor Il Jae's sake.

741
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,820
Please deal with...

742
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,320
Gun Woo for us.

743
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,780
Are you going to go back to Dodo Group?

744
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,580
- I might.
 -  Gi Tan.

745
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,020
I need a reason to stay close to Il Jae.

746
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,780
I came this far.

747
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,750
I want to end it.

748
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,610
To catch a beast,

749
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,950
the hunter's eye must move even quicker.

750
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,310
If Gi Tan returns to the company,

751
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,280
it'll be much easier for you.

752
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,550
Okay. I understand.

753
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,680
Where were we?

754
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,680
Right, Gi Tan's Chinese backers.

755
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,850
They're firearms dealers called Huaping.

756
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,220
They're smugglers,

757
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,820
but they do legal trades and lobby, too.

758
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,420
Tell me more.

759
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,290
They're mainly Chinese expats from Southeast Asia.

760
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:01,680
Nothing much else is known.

761
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,270
Little is known about the boss, too.

762
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,640
Are you saying Gi Tan is one of them?

763
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,720
Ok Chae Ryung.

764
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,780
She's a lobbyist.

765
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,950
And I think she's helping him.

766
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,960
But they kidnapped you, which means...

767
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,580
he's involved with them.

768
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,800
I'll find out more about them.

769
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,620
No. You don't have to.

770
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,050
There's a way to see them work in person.

771
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,780
My eyes...

772
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,020
will be quicker than your feet, Gi Tan.

773
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,180
Kang Ga Din, why are you ignoring my calls?

774
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,490
I hired someone to help you out.

775
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:03,120
Kang Ga Din, if you come back, I'll pay you double.

776
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,810
Miss Do.

777
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,620
He's a very talented person.

778
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,710
He'll be a lot of help.

779
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,950
Shoot.

780
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,950
Don't bother.

781
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,850
How talented can someone be?

782
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,950
I have to go.

783
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,450
Kang Ga Din!

784
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,350
Welcome back to the company.

785
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,270
Is he the person you hired?

786
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,350
Thank you, Sir.

787
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,910
Do you like your new manager title?

788
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,070
I don't deserve it.

789
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,080
For now,

790
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,650
forget everything else and focus on her.

791
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,820
You bet he should.

792
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,180
I feel like I just found my long-lost puppy.

793
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,640
Try to make a human out of her.

794
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,070
Dad, it's not like I'm a ghost or something.

795
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,350
I'm giving you a special mission,

796
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,720
okay?

797
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,710
Do anything but hit her.

798
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,810
Other than that, do what it takes to get some sense into her.

799
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:08,920
Yes, Sir.

800
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,650
You can't give my secretary a special mission.

801
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,250
If, for some reason,

802
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,420
she doesn't obey you,

803
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,960
come and tell me right away.

804
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,720
I will ban her from entering from that day onward.

805
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,550
Is this why he's back?

806
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,850
Gosh. Why did you have to accept the offer?

807
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,120
Gi Tan.

808
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,110
Is something wrong?

809
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:47,720
You don't look pleased.

810
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,520
Someone's been following me.

811
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,580
Who's that?

812
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,020
I plan to find out today.

813
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:16,980
Sir.

814
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,980
Gi Tan's coming over.

815
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,180
Uncle.

816
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,680
It's me, Guk Cheol.

817
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,750
Lee Guk Cheol.

818
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:00,750
I almost...

819
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,520
fell for it.

820
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,520
Uncle.
