<font color="yellow">Ji Soo,</font>

158
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,590
<font color="yellow">can you take Mum home?</font>

159
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,000
<font color="yellow">Why would I go there? You should go.</font>

160
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,960
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to someone from the court today.</font>

161
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,380
<font color="yellow">I need to get our restraining order lifted.</font>

162
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,960
<font color="yellow">How would you lift that?</font>

163
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,750
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you looking down on him right now?</font>

164
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,800
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

165
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,130
<font color="yellow">I'm not looking down on him.</font>

166
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,560
<font color="yellow">Stop complaining and come right out.</font>

167
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,300
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

168
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,230
<font color="yellow">You won't last much longer.</font>

169
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,040
<font color="yellow">Is he doing very bad?</font>

170
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,490
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's much worse today.</font>

171
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,500
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

172
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,060
<font color="yellow">Who's this?</font>

173
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
<font color="yellow">He doesn't recognise you, so make something up.</font>

174
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,230
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

175
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,360
<font color="yellow">your new assistant as of today.</font>

176
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
<font color="yellow">My assistant?</font>

177
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,000
<font color="yellow">Did you hire him?</font>

178
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,530
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

179
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,130
<font color="yellow">He looks like someone I know.</font>

180
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

181
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,130
<font color="yellow">Why aren't we getting ready to go to Mr Hwang's house?</font>

182
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,130
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  I want to go see Gwi Ja.</font>

183
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,030
<font color="yellow">He's been looking for her since early in the morning.</font>

184
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,160
<font color="yellow">We should just let him see her.</font>

185
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,460
<font color="yellow">Let's get him to the hospital.</font>

186
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

187
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

188
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,380
<font color="yellow">Let's get dressed...</font>

189
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,990
<font color="yellow">so we can go and see Mrs Hwang.</font>

190
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,760
<font color="yellow">- Sure.
-  Okay.</font>

191
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,360
<font color="yellow">- Mrs Hwang.
-  Who are you people?</font>

192
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,480
<font color="yellow">They are here to diagnose him on a court order...</font>

193
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,500
<font color="yellow">to announce your father as incompetent.</font>

194
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,480
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

195
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,500
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

196
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

197
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,830
<font color="yellow">When did you hire...</font>

198
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,860
<font color="yellow">a new housekeeper?</font>

199
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,260
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

200
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
<font color="yellow">You don't even...</font>

201
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,900
<font color="yellow">recognise me any more.</font>

202
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,800
<font color="yellow">He recognised you last time.</font>

203
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,900
<font color="yellow">Get out of here. You're on a restraining order so...</font>

204
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,800
<font color="yellow">Did you think I wouldn't know that he has dementia?</font>

205
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,160
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

206
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,630
<font color="yellow">He's my new assistant.</font>

207
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,630
<font color="yellow">Did he do something wrong?</font>

208
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,270
<font color="yellow">This is definite.</font>

209
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,700
<font color="yellow">He doesn't recognise his wife and calls his son his assistant.</font>

210
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,460
<font color="yellow">Diagnose him with dementia.</font>

211
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

212
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,300
<font color="yellow">Take him and go.</font>

213
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,570
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong, Gwi Ja loves cake.</font>

214
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,060
<font color="yellow">We should get some on our way.</font>

215
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,660
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

216
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,660
<font color="yellow">I never hid the fact that he has dementia.</font>

217
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,980
<font color="yellow">Stop lying.</font>

218
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,650
<font color="yellow">I already heard from Dr Hwang.</font>

219
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,000
<font color="yellow">I just didn't see the need to tell you people.</font>

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,260
<font color="yellow">Of course you needed to.</font>

221
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,930
<font color="yellow">Your father wrote his will before he met you.</font>

222
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,800
<font color="yellow">You hid his illness because you knew you didn't have a part in his will.</font>

223
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,460
<font color="yellow">You're just like your mother.</font>

224
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,700
<font color="yellow">You're a liar and are good at stabbing someone's back.</font>

225
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,800
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Ji Soo.</font>

226
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,830
<font color="yellow">What happened...</font>

227
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,200
<font color="yellow">to finding someone who can write like Father?</font>

228
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,160
<font color="yellow">I found someone.</font>

229
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,230
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do?</font>

230
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,580
<font color="yellow">Meals here aren't that great.</font>

231
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,880
<font color="yellow">Everything here was...</font>

232
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,850
<font color="yellow">made by Lawyer Oh at home. They're very good.</font>

233
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,900
<font color="yellow">Have some.</font>

234
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,800
<font color="yellow">Il Jae never came to visit, did he?</font>

235
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,160
<font color="yellow">I never saw his name on your records.</font>

236
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,630
<font color="yellow">Dream all you like.</font>

237
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,530
<font color="yellow">I will never betray him.</font>

238
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,000
<font color="yellow">My goodness. If you were this loyal in the army,</font>

239
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
<font color="yellow">you'd be a general by now.</font>

240
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,160
<font color="yellow">Instead, you came to prison to rot because of Il Jae.</font>

241
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,060
<font color="yellow">I told Il Jae that I'm meeting you.</font>

242
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,100
<font color="yellow">I told him how you wouldn't give in, and he seemed very pleased.</font>

243
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,730
<font color="yellow">But he is...</font>

244
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,600
<font color="yellow">suspicious about everything.</font>

245
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,980
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if this will be all right.</font>

246
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,000
<font color="yellow">We're going to come every day.</font>

247
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,680
<font color="yellow">If you'd like a specific dish, you can tell me.</font>

248
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,760
<font color="yellow">Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

249
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,300
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to see me,</font>

250
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,260
<font color="yellow">tell me at least where the doctor...</font>

251
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,530
<font color="yellow">who performed Dong Soo's autopsy is hiding.</font>

252
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,330
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll tell you?</font>

253
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,330
<font color="yellow">- That means you do know.
-  Exactly.</font>

254
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,130
<font color="yellow">He does know.</font>

255
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,570
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything that you like in particular?</font>

256
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,600
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh is good at cooking meat dishes.</font>

257
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

258
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,700
<font color="yellow">you can persuade me with this?</font>

259
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,570
<font color="yellow">I have to try anything.</font>

260
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,280
<font color="yellow">If you were me,</font>

261
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,400
<font color="yellow">would you just sit around when your brother died a wrongful death?</font>

262
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,160
<font color="yellow">I'll be back tomorrow.</font>

263
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,700
<font color="yellow">You can take your time and eat them all.</font>

264
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,100
<font color="yellow">Come on. Eat up. They look great.</font>

265
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,100
<font color="yellow">If you don't eat everything, I'll sue you.</font>

266
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,630
<font color="yellow">The chairman's writing is on the right...</font>

267
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,860
<font color="yellow">and the left is a copy of his handwriting.</font>

268
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
<font color="yellow">Put them together.</font>

269
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
<font color="yellow">There are small differences.</font>

270
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,390
<font color="yellow">Experts say they are 90 percent identical.</font>

271
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,730
<font color="yellow">How long until 100 percent?</font>

272
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,680
<font color="yellow">One more week.</font>

273
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,760
<font color="yellow">Once it's finished,</font>

274
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,070
<font color="yellow">let handwriting experts take a look.</font>

275
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,530
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

276
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,280
<font color="yellow">Once I have Father's handwritten will,</font>

277
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,570
<font color="yellow">it wouldn't matter even if he's declared incompetent.</font>

278
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,400
<font color="yellow">You're really late. I told you to be on time.</font>

279
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,860
<font color="yellow">I'm not that late.</font>

280
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,030
<font color="yellow">We're late. Let's go.</font>

281
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,530
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

282
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,130
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

283
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,760
<font color="yellow">Do you remember Chainsaw So?</font>

284
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,030
<font color="yellow">He's going to hand me his matured bonds.</font>

285
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,570
<font color="yellow">It's a very important meeting. Do not make any mistakes.</font>

286
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,730
<font color="yellow">To Gi Tan, you're nothing but a family member of his enemy.</font>

287
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,500
<font color="yellow">He'll just use you...</font>

288
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,130
<font color="yellow">and leave you in misery.</font>

289
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,860
<font color="yellow">Say hello. This is Chainsaw...</font>

290
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,260
<font color="yellow">I mean,</font>

291
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,700
<font color="yellow">Chairman So Gil Du.</font>

292
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,860
<font color="yellow">I'm Do Shin Young, Dodo Hotel's CEO.</font>

293
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,780
<font color="yellow">I heard Chairman Do had a shrew for a daughter.</font>

294
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,940
<font color="yellow">That must be you.</font>

295
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,300
<font color="yellow">A shrew?</font>

296
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,430
<font color="yellow">Do I look like a shrew?</font>

297
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,530
<font color="yellow">Hey, Shin Young.</font>

298
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,430
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

299
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,670
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

300
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,730
<font color="yellow">bring this girl?</font>

301
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,460
<font color="yellow">Shin Young...</font>

302
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,130
<font color="yellow">will be the next chairwoman of Dodo Group.</font>

303
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,720
<font color="yellow">The next chairwoman?</font>

304
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,660
<font color="yellow">We plan on changing the holding company of Dodo Group...</font>

305
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,330
<font color="yellow">from Dodo Pharmaceutical to Dodo Hotel.</font>

306
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,730
<font color="yellow">Is that the best...</font>

307
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,000
<font color="yellow">you came up with by using my bonds?</font>

308
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,860
<font color="yellow">Ms Do and I have signed a shareholders' voting agreement.</font>

309
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,930
<font color="yellow">I'll be participating in Dodo Group's management.</font>

310
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,760
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

311
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,430
<font color="yellow">How much bonds did you get so far?</font>

312
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,800
<font color="yellow">It's really nothing compared to...</font>

313
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,830
<font color="yellow">what you have.</font>

314
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,870
<font color="yellow">During the next creditors' meeting﻿,</font>

315
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,800
<font color="yellow">a voting will take place on the extension of the bonds.</font>

316
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,500
<font color="yellow">I have about 30 percent in bonds.</font>

317
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,830
<font color="yellow">You have to persuade the others to get the majority to vote.</font>

318
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,630
<font color="yellow">I'll be supporting you.</font>

319
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,130
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to secure the other 20 percent myself?</font>

320
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,160
<font color="yellow">Then did you think that things would...</font>

321
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,600
<font color="yellow">automatically sort out?</font>

322
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,660
<font color="yellow">If the majority votes for you,</font>

323
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,930
<font color="yellow">I'll pass over the bonds and give you the loan as well.</font>

324
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,330
<font color="yellow">You're trying to test me.</font>

325
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,460
<font color="yellow">This is a huge bet for me.</font>

326
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,900
<font color="yellow">I should at least test you.</font>

327
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,400
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

328
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,900
<font color="yellow">I'll get the majority on my side before the creditors' meeting.</font>

329
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,360
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

330
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,500
<font color="yellow">Most of them are on Chairman Do Choong's side.</font>

331
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,330
<font color="yellow">Ms Do will help me.</font>

332
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,800
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that right?
-  What?</font>

333
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,730
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

334
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,560
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

335
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,560
<font color="yellow">I just hope Vice Chairman Do will sit still.</font>

336
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,530
<font color="yellow">You heard him, right?</font>

337
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,100
<font color="yellow">Yes. About making me into the chairwoman?</font>

338
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,170
<font color="yellow">Not that.</font>

339
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,410
<font color="yellow">We have to persuade 20 percent of the creditors.</font>

340
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,000
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, I'll help you.</font>

341
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,700
<font color="yellow">We better meet the creditors right away.</font>

342
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,330
<font color="yellow">Please set meetings with the ones that will be easier to persuade.</font>

343
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

344
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,900
<font color="yellow">- Gi Tan met with Chainsaw So?
-  Yes.</font>

345
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,130
<font color="yellow">He even took Shin Young with him.</font>

346
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,070
<font color="yellow">Doesn't this mean Chainsaw So is siding with him?</font>

347
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,800
<font color="yellow">Find out where Chainsaw So is right now.</font>

348
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

349
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,830
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

350
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,600
<font color="yellow">Hello, Vice Chairman Do.</font>

351
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,530
<font color="yellow">If you didn't eat yet, why don't you join me?</font>

352
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,430
<font color="yellow">I ate.</font>

353
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,800
<font color="yellow">I've been coming to this place for 30 years now.</font>

354
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,530
<font color="yellow">I almost lost it to Kang Gi Tan.</font>

355
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,230
<font color="yellow">Why did you see him?</font>

356
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,230
<font color="yellow">Did you promise him your bonds?</font>

357
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,860
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

358
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,500
<font color="yellow">That means there's a possibility.</font>

359
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,200
<font color="yellow">I'll see at the next creditors' meeting.</font>

360
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,330
<font color="yellow">That's not what you promised.</font>

361
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,400
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

362
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,570
<font color="yellow">still believe in promises?</font>

363
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,960
<font color="yellow">I don't believe in anything without a signature.</font>

364
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,230
<font color="yellow">- Sir...
-  He'll be persuading the creditors.</font>

365
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,600
<font color="yellow">You can try to stop him yourself.</font>

366
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,200
<font color="yellow">I'm going to root for Gi Tan.</font>

367
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,960
<font color="yellow">If 20 percent or more support him...</font>

368
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,830
<font color="yellow">along with my 30 percent,</font>

369
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,430
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group...</font>

370
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,540
<font color="yellow">will be in trouble.</font>

371
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,710
<font color="yellow">What if I block the majority?</font>

372
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,800
<font color="yellow">If that's the case,</font>

373
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,560
<font color="yellow">my 30 percent will be used on you.</font>

374
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
<font color="yellow">When that happens,</font>

375
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,830
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan won't ever get a chance to step into this world.</font>

376
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,000
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that you trust Gi Tan more than me?</font>

377
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,060
<font color="yellow">No, I don't trust either of you.</font>

378
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,230
<font color="yellow">But what can I do?</font>

379
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,360
<font color="yellow">I'll have to push out the one I trust even less.</font>

380
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,900
<font color="yellow">Get the list of the creditors...</font>

381
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,980
<font color="yellow">and set meetings in the order of percentage.</font>

382
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

383
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,030
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan already secured Chainsaw So's 30 percent.</font>

384
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,360
<font color="yellow">How is this going to work?</font>

385
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,660
<font color="yellow">I have to try my best until the creditors' meeting.</font>

386
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
<font color="yellow">You won't extend the bonds?</font>

387
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,150
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  I'm against it.</font>

388
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,460
<font color="yellow">How is it any good for us if Dodo Group goes under?</font>

389
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,430
<font color="yellow">The company won't be ruined.</font>

390
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,760
<font color="yellow">I'm saying we'll revive the company through some restructuring.</font>

391
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,160
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang.</font>

392
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
<font color="yellow">How much bonds do you have right now?</font>

393
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,330
<font color="yellow">Over 30 percent.</font>

394
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,260
<font color="yellow">Do you think we're blind?</font>

395
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,200
<font color="yellow">I believe you only have 6 to 7 percent.</font>

396
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,060
<font color="yellow">(Chairman So)</font>

397
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,760
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang. What is it?</font>

398
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,830
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't I get you to sign a contract...</font>

399
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,440
<font color="yellow">to support me during the next creditors' meeting?</font>

400
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,960
<font color="yellow">You're as doubtful as me, aren't you?</font>

401
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,900
<font color="yellow">I love contracts, that's all.</font>

402
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,500
<font color="yellow">Come any time. I'll sign it for you.</font>

403
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,160
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

404
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,730
<font color="yellow">You all know that Chairman So Gil Du...</font>

405
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,230
<font color="yellow">has over 30 percent in bonds, right?</font>

406
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,760
<font color="yellow">That Gi Tan...</font>

407
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,230
<font color="yellow">He's borrowing my power...</font>

408
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,060
<font color="yellow">to grab this golden opportunity.</font>

409
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,560
<font color="yellow">Even if that's the case,</font>

410
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,930
<font color="yellow">we're loyal to the Do family.</font>

411
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,700
<font color="yellow">We can't betray them overnight.</font>

412
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,630
<font color="yellow">- Why is she so late?
-  She'll be here soon.</font>

413
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,000
<font color="yellow">CEO Do Shin Young is here.</font>

414
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,030
<font color="yellow">Long time no see.</font>

415
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,200
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

416
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,400
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what this is about?</font>

417
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,590
<font color="yellow">I came because Chairman Kang asked me. Should I leave?</font>

418
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,600
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

419
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,930
<font color="yellow">Do you support Chairman Kang?</font>

420
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,760
<font color="yellow">You all know what a mess my family is in.</font>

421
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,560
<font color="yellow">The company is my priority.</font>

422
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,430
<font color="yellow">In order to save it,</font>

423
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,960
<font color="yellow">I believe Chairman Kang's plan is the right way.</font>

424
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,530
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan is securing more creditors.</font>

425
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,730
<font color="yellow">He seems to be doing well since he has Shin Young on his side.</font>

426
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,310
<font color="yellow">Is she crazy?</font>

427
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,300
<font color="yellow">I warned her, and yet she's still helping him?</font>

428
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,030
<font color="yellow">I've never considered Shin Young...</font>

429
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,630
<font color="yellow">in my predictions.</font>

430
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,000
<font color="yellow">How is it looking on Gun Woo's side?</font>

431
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,830
<font color="yellow">He's meeting with creditors with more bonds.</font>

432
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,700
<font color="yellow">Since Chainsaw So is supporting Gi Tan,</font>

433
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,560
<font color="yellow">he's at a disadvantage.</font>

434
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,700
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you help Gun Woo?</font>

435
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,860
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo or Gi Tan, it's all the same to me.</font>

436
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,200
<font color="yellow">You can't leave Gi Tan to take over Dodo Group.</font>

437
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,700
<font color="yellow">If I bring Chainsaw So to my side,</font>

438
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,830
<font color="yellow">I could be the winner of this battle.</font>

439
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,960
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you'll try to take over Dodo Group?</font>

440
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,330
<font color="yellow">Chainsaw So...</font>

441
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,000
<font color="yellow">isn't going to be easy to persuade.</font>

442
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,100
<font color="yellow">I'll have to offer him a better deal than Gi Tan did.</font>

443
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,130
<font color="yellow">You have a visitor.</font>

444
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,660
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

445
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,400
<font color="yellow">It's the ex-Seoul mayor candidate, Byun Il Jae.</font>

446
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,430
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you this just in case.</font>

447
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,080
<font color="yellow">If a man named Byun Il Jae comes to you, don't see him.</font>

448
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,580
<font color="yellow">Is he interested in Dodo Group as well?</font>

449
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,200
<font color="yellow">He's a greedy person.</font>

450
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he'll be drooling somewhere.</font>

451
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
<font color="yellow">Should I bring him in?</font>

452
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

453
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,630
<font color="yellow">I'll go outside to see him.</font>

454
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,300
<font color="yellow">I'm So Gil Du. What is this about?</font>

455
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,460
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you. I'm Byun Il Jae.</font>

456
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,630
<font color="yellow">I know you very well.</font>

457
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,700
<font color="yellow">I voted you for Seoul Mayor...</font>

458
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,700
<font color="yellow">and almost wanted to cut off my hand.</font>

459
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

460
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,000
<font color="yellow">Actually, I have something...</font>

461
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
<font color="yellow">I'd like to discuss with you.</font>

462
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,960
<font color="yellow">Kang Gi Tan told me you'd come to see me.</font>

463

<font color="yellow">He asked me to give this to you.</font>

464
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,730

466

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

467
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,900
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

468
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,700

469
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,730
<font color="yellow">Get out of here.</font>

470

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

474
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,160

<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you...</font>

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,500
<font color="yellow">Didn't Gi Tan say he'd help you?</font>

483
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,130
<font color="yellow">Dirty money...</font>

484
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,130
<font color="yellow">can be spent wisely.</font>

485
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,460
<font color="yellow">Dangerous money, however, you must never touch.</font>

486
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,180
<font color="yellow">Il Jae's money is just as dangerous.</font>

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,530
<font color="yellow">I can...</font>

488
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,630
<font color="yellow">get rid of Il Jae at any time.</font>

489

494
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,070
<font color="yellow">because of Chairman So and Ms Do.</font>

495
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,200

00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,200
<font color="yellow">Can I go now?</font>

505
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,130

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

621
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,700
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

622
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,930
<font color="yellow">Your request.</font>

623
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,900
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

624
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,980
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

<font color="yellow">In return,</font>

626
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,000
<font color="yellow">I expect you to keep your promise.</font>

627
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,560
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

628
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,930
<font color="yellow">Did he say yes?</font>

629
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,230
<font color="yellow">We did it.</font>

630
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,660
<font color="yellow">Sir. Do you feel better?</font>

631
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,830
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

632
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

633
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,330
<font color="yellow">am I doing here?</font>

634
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

635
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,000
<font color="yellow">Do I...</font>

636
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,860
<font color="yellow">have an illness?</font>

637
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,530
<font color="yellow">You have dementia.</font>

638
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,500
<font color="yellow">Dementia?</font>

639
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,600
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Father.</font>

640
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,060
<font color="yellow">You'll get better if you receive treatment.</font>

641

<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

642
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,730
<font color="yellow">What about my will?</font>

643
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,930
<font color="yellow">You can make it once you recover.</font>

644
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,030
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

645
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,160
<font color="yellow">I'll do that.</font>

646
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,860
<font color="yellow">You need intensive care.</font>

647
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,500
<font color="yellow">I think you should stay here.</font>

648
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,560
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

649
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,260

00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,800
<font color="yellow">it's over for me.</font>

657
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,600
<font color="yellow">You should...</font>

<font color="yellow">take over Dodo and...</font>

659
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,610
<font color="yellow">Please stay strong.</font>

660
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,900
<font color="yellow">I can't live without you, Father.</font>

661
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,000
<font color="yellow">You can beat this.</font>

662
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,660

667
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,430
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Soo Yeon,</font>

<font color="yellow">Will you stay?</font>

674
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,970
<font color="yellow">I should stay with him.</font>

675
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I can't take you home.</font>

676

<font color="yellow">You're early.</font>

00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,100
<font color="yellow">I'm meeting the creditors before the meeting.</font>

685
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,330
<font color="yellow">You look pretty confident.</font>

686
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,260
<font color="yellow">Why put on a show when we both know the other's hand?</font>

687
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,400
<font color="yellow">We have 58 percent, so you must have 42 percent.</font>

<font color="yellow">Shin Young, let's have a word.</font>

692
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,230
<font color="yellow">Don't you know why he wants the matured bonds?</font>

693
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,260
<font color="yellow">We'll go bankrupt if the creditors don't extend it.</font>

694
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,360
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

695
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,930
<font color="yellow">If you're still helping him,</font>

696
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,430
<font color="yellow">that means you betrayed your father and the company.</font>

697
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,900
<font color="yellow">I trust Gi Tan.</font>

698

00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,400
<font color="yellow">You don't know what kind of person he is.</font>

701
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,610
<font color="yellow">I know very well.</font>

702
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,930
<font color="yellow">He almost died when you framed him for murder.</font>

703
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,030
<font color="yellow">I won't let Father accept and acknowledge someone like you.</font>

704
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,740
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm helping him.</font>

705
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,330

-  Then...</font>

709

<font color="yellow">you must also know that Gi Tan's using you.</font>

710
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,560
<font color="yellow">If he really wanted to use me,</font>

711
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,430
<font color="yellow">he wouldn't have refused my wedding proposal.</font>

712
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,600
<font color="yellow">He will not go back on his word.</font>

713
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,100
<font color="yellow">He's not like you.</font>

714

<font color="yellow">As soon as the meeting is over,</font>

715
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,630
<font color="yellow">I will have you ousted from the company.</font>

716
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,530

720
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,030

<font color="yellow">I'm hanging up.</font>

777
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,830
<font color="yellow">I'm probably the only one who can take care of this.</font>

778
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,700
<font color="yellow">Won't you even ask me for a favour?</font>

779
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,070
<font color="yellow">You must not be too desperate.</font>

780
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,430
<font color="yellow">I already know that you won't help me.</font>

781
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,530
<font color="yellow">I don't like Gun Woo.</font>

782
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,760
<font color="yellow">He's very impudent just like his father.</font>

783
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,130
<font color="yellow">Does that mean...</font>

784
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,130
<font color="yellow">you may help me?</font>

785
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,960
<font color="yellow">That may happen.</font>

786
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,500
<font color="yellow">Don't try to sound me out. Goodbye.</font>

787
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,400
<font color="yellow">Who was that? My uncle?</font>

788
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,120
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

789
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,660
<font color="yellow">You should've let me talk to him.</font>

790
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,900
<font color="yellow">He may do this if I asked.</font>

791
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,330
<font color="yellow">Even if you asked,</font>

792
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,730
<font color="yellow">I doubt Mr Hwang will help me.</font>

793
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, Commissioner Lee.</font>

794
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,460
<font color="yellow">It's me, Jae Man.</font>

795
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,880
<font color="yellow">Isn't there...</font>

796
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,360
<font color="yellow">a team named Private Loan Task Force?</font>

797
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,060
<font color="yellow">One of my friends...</font>

798
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,000
<font color="yellow">named So Gil Du was...</font>

799
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,700
<font color="yellow">just arrested by them.</font>

800
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,860
<font color="yellow">Chairman So.</font>

801
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:04,900
<font color="yellow">I guess the Chinese Embassy is powerful.</font>

802
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,200
<font color="yellow">The Chinese Embassy?</font>

803
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,700
<font color="yellow">I heard Jae Man let me out.</font>

804
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,490
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

805
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,030
<font color="yellow">I heard it with my own ears.</font>

806
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,300
<font color="yellow">I heard Jae Man let me out.</font>

807
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,030
<font color="yellow">Your call cannot be connected.</font>

808
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,470
<font color="yellow">He can't take your call because the meeting already began.</font>

809
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,400
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
-  Your call...</font>

810
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,320
<font color="yellow">cannot be connected. Please leave your message...</font>

811
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,800
<font color="yellow">This meeting is...</font>

812
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:38,630
<font color="yellow">about renewing the contract of your matured bonds.</font>

813
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,930
<font color="yellow">Please share your thoughts freely...</font>

814
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,860
<font color="yellow">if you'd like to speak.</font>

815
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:53,000
<font color="yellow">(Creditors' Meeting for Dodo Group)</font>

816
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,300
<font color="yellow">I'd like to make...</font>

817
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:59,760
<font color="yellow">a formal request to Dodo Group.</font>

818
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,030
<font color="yellow">If you'd like a renewal of our contract,</font>

819
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,130
<font color="yellow">you will have to change...</font>

820
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:07,330
<font color="yellow">your holding company...</font>

821
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,760
<font color="yellow">from Dodo Pharmaceutical to Dodo Hotel.</font>

822
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,600
<font color="yellow">The current speaker is the second large shareholder of Dodo Hotel.</font>

823
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,330
<font color="yellow">He's currently plotting a scheme with the largest shareholder,</font>

824
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,430
<font color="yellow">CEO Do Shin Young, to take Dodo Group for themselves.</font>

825
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,900
<font color="yellow">Vice President Do Gun Woo.</font>

826
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,200
<font color="yellow">Didn't you recently inspect your subsidiaries?</font>

827
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,500
<font color="yellow">This is a report of his inspection,</font>

828
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,630
<font color="yellow">which I got a few days ago.</font>

829
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,200
<font color="yellow">According to this report,</font>

830
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,500
<font color="yellow">there are seven subsidiaries...</font>

831
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:51,260
<font color="yellow">that have more accumulated deficit than their capital.</font>

832
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,100
<font color="yellow">That means seven subsidiaries...</font>

833
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,430
<font color="yellow">may go bankrupt within the year.</font>

834
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,730
<font color="yellow">You may refute me if I'm wrong, Vice President Do.</font>

835
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,660
<font color="yellow">Here is the most important fact.</font>

836
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,100
<font color="yellow">Among the subsidiaries, the biggest deficit...</font>

837
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,730
<font color="yellow">belongs to Dodo Pharmaceutical.</font>

838
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,030
<font color="yellow">- What does that mean?
-  Dodo Pharmaceutical?</font>

839
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,060
<font color="yellow">I tell you,</font>

840
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,710
<font color="yellow">if this goes on,</font>

841
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:26,060
<font color="yellow">no one sitting in this room...</font>

842
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,330
<font color="yellow">will be able to get his or her principal back.</font>

843
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,760
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

844
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,500
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  That's absurd.</font>

845
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,100
<font color="yellow">I applaud you for trying,</font>

846
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,160
<font color="yellow">but it's already over.</font>

847
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,430
<font color="yellow">I own 42 percent...</font>

848
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,630
<font color="yellow">and you have 28 percent without Chainsaw So's shares.</font>

849
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,800
<font color="yellow">And now,</font>

850
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:14,210
<font color="yellow">we will vote yes or no...</font>

851
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,200
<font color="yellow">on renewing the contract.</font>

852
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:17,930
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

853
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,830
<font color="yellow">Before we vote, someone would like to say a word.</font>

854
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,160
<font color="yellow">I was...</font>

855
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,260
<font color="yellow">just arrested by the police.</font>

856
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,660
<font color="yellow">Someone here...</font>

857
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,030
<font color="yellow">reported me for giving out illegal private loans.</font>

858
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,430
<font color="yellow">Well, need I say more?</font>

859
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,100
<font color="yellow">Let us...</font>

860
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,360
<font color="yellow">vote.</font>

861
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,860
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

862
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:12,000
<font color="yellow">not Gi Tan or Gun Woo, but Il Jae will be taking it over?</font>

863
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,500
<font color="yellow">Yes. If things go as he planned.</font>

864
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,930
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

865
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,000
<font color="yellow">Did you let Chainsaw So out...</font>

866
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,360
<font color="yellow">not to help Gi Tan but...</font>

867
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,930
<font color="yellow">I've taken Il Jae's side.</font>

868
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,700
<font color="yellow">I will announce the result.</font>

869
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,300
<font color="yellow">(Yes, No)</font>

870
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,200
<font color="yellow">(Yes, No)</font>

871
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,000
<font color="yellow">(Yes, No)</font>

872
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,200
<font color="yellow">Just as I promised,</font>

873
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,810
<font color="yellow">I will sell my bonds to you.</font>

874
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,210
<font color="yellow">I need a loan, too.</font>

875
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,070
<font color="yellow">Make sure you pay your interest.</font>

876
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:36,100
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

877
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,210
<font color="yellow">You should take him back home.</font>

878
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

879
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,600
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

880
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,630
<font color="yellow">I do not understand why Jae Man took our side.</font>

881
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,360
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's up to something.</font>

882
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,500
<font color="yellow">But I'm not sure what it is.</font>

883
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:57,260
<font color="yellow">Who cares? Dodo Group is ours.</font>

884
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,090
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak.</font>

885
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,660
<font color="yellow">Will you take Shin Young back to the hotel?</font>

886
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,900
<font color="yellow">Aren't you coming?</font>

887
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,120
<font color="yellow">We should celebrate.</font>

888
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,630
<font color="yellow">We'll celebrate later. You can go ahead, Shin Young.</font>

889
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,400
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

890
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,130
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

891
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,630
<font color="yellow">I am going to confess my love to Soo Yeon today.</font>

892
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,330
<font color="yellow">I destroyed Gun Woo today.</font>

893
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,360
<font color="yellow">You can't stop me any more.</font>

894
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,260
<font color="yellow">I do not mind,</font>

895
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,500
<font color="yellow">but I'm afraid your headache may start again.</font>

896
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,060
<font color="yellow">I'd rather have that headache.</font>

897
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,630
<font color="yellow">Whenever I see her,</font>

898
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,130
<font color="yellow">my heart aches so much...</font>

899
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,760
<font color="yellow">that I can't stand it.</font>

900
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,960
<font color="yellow">Your fight against Gi Tan was...</font>

901
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,930
<font color="yellow">very intriguing.</font>

902
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,360
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd ask for my help,</font>

903
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,660
<font color="yellow">but you went to Mr Hwang instead.</font>

904
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,700
<font color="yellow">Do you see now, Gun Woo?</font>

905
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,760
<font color="yellow">You can't win against Gi Tan without my help.</font>

906
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,500
<font color="yellow">I want to be alone.</font>

907
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,530
<font color="yellow">So please leave.</font>

908
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,100
<font color="yellow">Don't change...</font>

909
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,300
<font color="yellow">your holding company to Dodo Hotel.</font>

910
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,710
<font color="yellow">In that case, Gi Tan will take out all of his matured bonds.</font>

911
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:36,860
<font color="yellow">Let him do it.</font>

912
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,360
<font color="yellow">We're in no financial position to prevent bankruptcy.</font>

913
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,360
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

914
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,960
<font color="yellow">a plan.</font>

915
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,760
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

916
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

917
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,000
<font color="yellow">I'd like to talk to you.</font>

918
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,330
<font color="yellow">See you at home.</font>

919
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:26,960
<font color="yellow">Let's go somewhere else.</font>

920
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,900
<font color="yellow">What do you want to say?</font>

921
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,630
<font color="yellow">A man...</font>

922
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:49,000
<font color="yellow">fell in love three times.</font>

923
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,100
<font color="yellow">Would you believe if I said it was with the same woman?</font>

924
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,430
<font color="yellow">The first time,</font>

925
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,830
<font color="yellow">the man was unable to see.</font>

926
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,760
<font color="yellow">10 years later...</font>

927
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,330
<font color="yellow">when he met her again after regaining his sight,</font>

928
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:19,000
<font color="yellow">he didn't know she was the one he was looking for.</font>

929
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,030
<font color="yellow">And he fell in love again.</font>

930
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,260
<font color="yellow">Then the man...</font>

931
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,930
<font color="yellow">lost his memory.</font>

932
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,960
<font color="yellow">Being the fool he was,</font>
