1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,310
Your future stands...

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,040
with Dodo Group.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,970
(Dodo Group)

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,170
Who... Who are you?

5
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,410
Please don't let go.

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,110
You'll go six feet below, Byun Il Jae.

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,280
You are...

8
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,440
Sir.

9
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,240
Gi Tan's coming over.

10
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,270
Uncle.

11
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,040
It's me, Guk Cheol.

12
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,040
Lee Guk Cheol.

13
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,810
I almost...

14
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,540
fell for it.

15
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,540
Uncle.

16
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,970
I finished it.

17
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,010
Listen to me.

18
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,670
Nothing will change no matter if you're sane...

19
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,010
or insane.

20
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,510
From now on, where I stand...

21
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,270
will become your fire pits of torture.

22
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,770
No, it's all broken.

23
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,370
I won't let you have it!

24
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,790
I won't fall for this.

25
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,140
I will never fall for this!

26
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,170
Everything will be mine!

27
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
No, let go of me!

28
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,900
Hey, let go of me!

29
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,630
- No!
 -  Calm him down.

30
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,940
No! It's mine!

31
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Are you okay?

32
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,870
I'm fine.

33
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Yes.

34
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,970
Welcome back to the fire pits of torture,

35
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,210
Guk Cheol.

36
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,250
Since Guk Cheol showed his true identity,

37
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,940
There is no need for you to stay here any more.

38
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,410
He was just testing me.

39
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,470
He doesn't care if his identity is revealed.

40
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,610
There is no need to play his game.

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Are you saying you'll stay here?

42
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,440
I left things in Gun Woo's hands. We'll see.

43
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,370
Choong Dong,

44
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,510
I want you to look for a girl named Cha Jeong Eun.

45
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,470
She has to be someone around Gi Tan.

46
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,470
If I remember correctly,

47
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,040
her younger brother was suffering from a rare disease.

48
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,910
What was it again?

49
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,960
Right. It's Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,440
That would be the fastest way to find her.

51
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,260
I'll do that.

52
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,510
(This disease is an epileptic encephalopathy.)

53
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,810
What is he drawing?

54
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,970
It's the eyesight test chart.

55
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,970
He just had his eyes tested.

56
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,360
He remembered it just from seeing it once?

57
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,230
The doctor told me that...

58
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,330
he can remember anything he sees like a photograph in his brain.

59
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,760
I see. He has photographic memory?

60
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,430
(The ability to remember what one sees and hears like a photograph.)

61
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,140
He really is a genius.

62
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,110
I wish he could use his talent.

63
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,810
What is this?

64
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,340
It's a pigeon?

65
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,500
I have to go to Gi Tan's. Are you heading out, too?

66
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,570
Do you visit him at his place now?

67
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,500
I owe him for something so I offered to treat him.

68
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,040
Then he asked me to cook for him instead.

69
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,900
That's an old trick.

70
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,470
He just wants to be alone with you. Does he want ramyeon?

71
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,740
No, he wants home food.

72
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,570
He's sick of eating out.

73
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,270
Il Jae is acting his illness?

74
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,270
Aren't you being too sensitive?

75
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,510
Choong Dong has been tailing me.

76
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,970
We can't let our guards down.

77
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,260
We need to keep an eye on Il Jae.

78
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,310
I thought...

79
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,710
our business was over.

80
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,270
What do you mean?

81
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,740
- Cha Woo.
 -  We succeeded...

82
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
in developing the MK2 vaccine.

83
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,870
Gi Tan, just ignore him.

84
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,000
If there is anything I can help with...

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,110
Good. I was getting sick of drawing blood.

86
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,670
I'll take care of Il Jae.

87
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,870
Thanks for all your help.

88
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,370
Gi Tan!

89
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,960
Chae Ryung, wake up.

90
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,810
- Let me go.
 -  If we don't...

91
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,210
collect the MK2 vaccine from Na Do Gwang,

92
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,740
we'll both die in boss' hands.

93
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,310
We can't afford to help Gi Tan any more.

94
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,470
Are you sure the vaccine works on the mutant virus?

95
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,910
That could only explain...

96
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,010
why Do Gwang ran away with the vaccine's blueprints.

97
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,710
What is this about an MK2 vaccine?

98
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,710
Hi, Soo Yeon.

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,770
Where are you?

100
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,910
Sorry, I forgot.

101
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,960
Where are you?

102
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,170
I'm in front of your place. I already bought groceries.

103
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,770
I'll give you the password. You can go inside.

104
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,740
How long will you take?

105
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,210
Okay. That's enough time for me to cook and set up.

106
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,970
All right. See you soon.

107
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,940
Where was the kitchen again?

108
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,340
Why would you ring your own doorbell?

109
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,280
Where did you get that apron?

110
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,470
I got it while buying groceries.

111
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Aren't you coming in?

112
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,110
What?

113
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,540
Right.

114
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,810
How did you make all this?

115
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,540
Have some before it's cold.

116
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,840
How is it?

117
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,610
It's so good.

118
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm a pretty good cook.

119
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,040
I know it's good, but you should talk while you eat.

120
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,540
By the way, when was your first love?

121
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,570
What kind of question is that? You're so corny.

122
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,610
Don't tell me you never had a first love.

123
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,440
Come on, what do you take me for?

124
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,780
Then tell me. When was it?

125
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,010
It was during high school.

126
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,540
Okay. Then who was it?

127
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,010
He was a super rich boy.

128
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,870
His mother was the director of a hospital.

129
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,080
That must have been nice.

130
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,840
No way. He was really rude and temperamental.

131
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,740
But...

132
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,510
He was really handsome.

133
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,240
Although he was a boy, he had beautiful eyes.

134
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,410
Do you still...

135
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,770
miss him?

136
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,570
That's enough. Just eat.

137
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,610
Okay.

138
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,340
Don't eat so fast. You'll get sick.

139
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,970
It's delicious.

140
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,040
What?

141
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,210
Why is he calling me all the time?

142
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,310
Yes, Sir.

143
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,870
You have to work tonight. Come to the office.

144
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,500
What? But I am currently with a friend.

145
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,800
Don't you know you have a commercial tomorrow?

146
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,470
Enough whining and get over here.

147
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,840
If he wasn't my boss, I would've...

148
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,040
What is it? Is Gun Woo bothering you?

149
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
That little...

150
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,370
We're shooting a commercial tomorrow. I should go.

151
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm sorry. I'll cook you something better next time.

152
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,910
I'm here.

153
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,870
Where is Hae Il?

154
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,410
He's not coming.

155
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,810
Sit down.

156
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,710
We decided to do a pictorial instead for the shoot tomorrow.

157
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,670
No.

158
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,610
Read it here.

159
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,170
I'll do it at my desk.

160
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,730
Do you feel uncomfortable with me?

161
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,740
No, it's not that...

162
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,910
I'm just a little awkward.

163
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,510
We used to be colleagues.

164
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,710
You used to joke and make fun of me.

165
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,340
I thought we'd get closer with your new job.

166
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,940
What's going on between you and Gi Tan?

167
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,970
What?

168
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,640
You can take those documents home.

169
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,270
May I go home?

170
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:36,970
Soo Yeon.

171
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,940
Don't be late tomorrow.

172
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,310
No.

173
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,540
Mum, are you going somewhere nice today?

174
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,570
Why are you dressing up?

175
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,660
Did you find out Soo Yeon's schedule?

176
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,330
Yes, she has an commercial shooting at a park in the morning.

177
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,130
Get a car ready in time.

178
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,170
Yes, Ma'am.

179
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,560
Are you going after her?

180
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,330
Gun Woo said that he'll save the company...

181
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,540
along with Soo Yeon in just six months.

182
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,130
Yes, they are both real eyesores.

183
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,540
I can't bear to see him succeed.

184
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,670
And he's with Soo Yeon.

185
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,110
- I'm coming, too.
 -  You stay out of this.

186
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,870
I'd rather do this by myself.

187
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,270
Mum, you can do it.

188
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,680
Can you look over here? That's excellent.

189
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,100
All right, great.

190
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,810
Let's try the other hand.

191
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,930
Okay, great.

192
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,550
Can you turn a little? Good.

193
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,570
All right.

194
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,370
She's not so bad now.

195
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,770
Can you turn a little and face forward?

196
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,590
Okay, great job.

197
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,660
All right.

198
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,910
You're here, Ma'am.

199
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,120
What are you doing?

200
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,830
I'm shooting for the company...

201
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,940
Who said you could do such a thing?

202
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,570
- I'm sorry.
 -  Don't be sorry.

203
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,030
What brings you here?

204
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,540
I heard you flirted with Gwang Woo, too.

205
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,630
I never did that.

206
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,740
Nonsense.

207
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,460
Did you move onto him because Gwang Woo wouldn't budge?

208
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,300
Was the love child easier to seduce?

209
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,490
Ma'am.

210
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,730
Stop this right now!

211
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,190
You can't let a humdrum like her become the face of the company.

212
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,760
Does Dodo Group look that stupid to you?

213
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,930
No...

214
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,040
Stop it!

215
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,860
Did you just shout at me?

216
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,730
- Sir.
 -  It's not Soo Yeon's fault.

217
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,770
I chose her. I am the one responsible.

218
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,310
So what?

219
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,230
You can talk to me.

220
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,760
I know you're Chairman's wife,

221
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,980
but you can't treat an employee like...

222
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,240
My son is in prison because of this witch.

223
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,910
You got hit instead of her. That's what you get for covering.

224
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,210
- You can hit me again.
 -  What?

225
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,230
You're going to pick on her again, right?

226
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,270
You can pay your dues right here.

227
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,330
What kind of a man are you?

228
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,210
I am Chairman's son! And he's your husband.

229
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,480
Are you insane?

230
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,330
Just hit me.

231
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,230
He did nothing wrong.

232
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,540
You two are unbelievable.

233
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,030
I will make sure I watch how far...

234
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,170
you lowly people make it.

235
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,610
Sir.

236
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,210
- What time is the meeting?
 -  You can leave now.

237
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,710
Finish up the shooting before you return to the office.

238
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,330
(Dodo Group)

239
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,410
Who on earth...

240
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,810
invented the vaccine for the mutated influenza virus?

241
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,170
He's a biotech professor named Na Do Gwang.

242
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,610
Na Do Gwang?

243
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,540
Are you sure...

244
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,140
the vaccine works on the mutant virus?

245
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,870
That could only explain...

246
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,940
why Do Gwang ran away with the vaccine's blueprints.

247
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,930
Then what will happen with the vaccine we're creating?

248
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,530
Not only us, but everyone who's been developing...

249
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,840
vaccines for this virus will be affected greatly...

250
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,670
by his creation.

251
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,400
What on earth is this vaccine about?

252
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,170
It treats mutant influenza viruses.

253
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,920
We can...

254
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,440
expect to make around three billion dollars...

255
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,110
once it's developed.

256
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,570
Make sure you approach Na Do Gwang...

257
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,670
and make sure you buy off the vaccine from him.

258
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,580
Who can take this?

259
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,670
- I can.
 -  I'll do it.

260
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,740
Gun Woo has a project,

261
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,210
so Shin Young can take it.

262
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,570
I'm only letting her do this...

263
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,820
because she's with you, Manager Kang.

264
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,910
Yes, Chairman.

265
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,290
Did you say it was Huaping?

266
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,700
Is that Ok Chae Ryung's association?

267
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,410
Their boss is a man named Jo Gi Ryang.

268
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,100
Jo Gi Ryang?

269
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,740
This is the information about him.

270
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,840
(French arms transferred to Pakistan under Jo Gi Ryang.)

271
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,710
He sells arms to troubled areas of this world.

272
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,010
He speaks fluent Korean and he's from Beijing.

273
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,140
Other than that, there is no more information about him.

274
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,960
Is Gi Tan a member of Huaping?

275
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,670
I don't think he's directly associated.

276
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,660
Speak.

277
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,910
Let's meet right now.

278
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,210
What is it?

279
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,980
I thought of a great way to get back at Gi Tan.

280
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,740
He has his eyes on you, so be careful on your way out.

281
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,400
Did the vaccine really get stolen?

282
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,570
That vaccine is...

283
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,740
actually the MK2 vaccine made with Gi Tan's blood.

284
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,660
That must be why Ok Chae Ryung has been helping him.

285
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,840
If we take the vaccine,

286
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,310
Jo Gi Ryang will get his revenge.

287
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,010
That revenge will be done on Gi Tan, not us.

288
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,340
I will make sure that happens.

289
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,570
You aren't so bad.

290
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,910
I may be able to kill two birds with just one stone.

291
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,770
Tell me about the specifics.

292
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,310
Na Do Gwang.

293
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,740
(Na Do Gwang, a biotechnology doctor)

294
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,440
He's a biotechnology doctor who once served as a professor.

295
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,710
He loved gambling too much...

296
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,370
that he almost went bankrupt after he was fired from the university.

297
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,830
(Na Do Gwang)

298
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,740
But he succeeded in creating a vaccine for the mutant virus.

299
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,170
Na Do Gwang is infamous for his odd personality.

300
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,510
But...

301
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,870
I beg to differ.

302
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,570
He's not so great as he seems.

303
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,240
It's a hot day.

304
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,870
Right, Miss Do.

305
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,110
Do you like flowers?

306
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,970
Why do I keep seeing him in slow motion?

307
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,170
- Are my eyes acting up?
 -  He was treated as an outsider.

308
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,640
If you're sleepy, go wash your face.

309
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,510
I'm not sleepy.

310
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,540
So what? Where is this Na Do Gwang?

311
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,640
He returned to Korea a few days ago.

312
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,130
Everyone at Secretary's Office are looking for him in casinos,

313
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,740
so we'll find him soon.

314
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,470
These are the contracts we need to fill out with him.

315
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,510
This place is suffocating.

316
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,810
I'll check it at a cafe.

317
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,040
Bring me the contracts which Gi Tan wrote.

318
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,320
Gi Tan.

319
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,440
I have to be on my way.

320
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,310
You can take your time. I'll take care of Miss Do.

321
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,110
Look, I'm seeing him in slow motion again.

322
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
It's for you.

323
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,030
I don't like sweet drinks.

324
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,470
You need sugar when you're tired.

325
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,510
How is it? Doesn't it make you feel better?

326
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,270
No, it makes me more tired.

327
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,870
Why does he look so sparkly? It's so annoying.

328
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,740
Book me an appointment with an optometrist.

329
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,610
- Do your eyes hurt?
 -  Yes.

330
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,500
They're in critical condition.

331
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,100
So find me a good doctor.

332
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,240
They look fine to me.

333
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,470
Let me see.

334
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,410
Stop!

335
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,320
- Don't come within a metre radius.
 -  What?

336
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,040
I said, keep a distance from me.

337
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,940
Is that better?

338
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,470
Don't laugh.

339
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,610
You're making me feel bad. Don't laugh.

340
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,670
You're strange today.

341
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,210
I'm completely normal aside from my eyes.

342
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,410
Are you kidding me?

343
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,570
What kind of contract is this?

344
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,510
I'll explain, so listen carefully.

345
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,310
What are they doing?

346
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,200
They seem to be looking at work documents.

347
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,640
That's what I mean. Why would they do work there?

348
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,710
Don't mind them. Let's go.

349
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,430
I heard from the secretary's office...

350
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,470
that the chairman is considering Gi Tan as his son-in-law.

351
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,400
- Really?
 -  Yes.

352
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,040
That's why he got that crazy promotion.

353
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,010
Good for him.

354
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,910
They look good together, right?

355
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,310
Yes, you're right.

356
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,810
We found Do Gwang.

357
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,470
Where is he?

358
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,370
Hwang Hae Hotel in Incheon.

359
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,810
Let's go.

360
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,740
Here is the contract Gi Tan prepared.

361
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,360
Na Do Gwang is at the Hwang Hae Hotel in Incheon.

362
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,540
Go there and take Gi Tan with you.

363
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,210
Yes, Sir.

364
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,370
Vice Chairman.

365
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,470
Hurry up, I'm busy.

366
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,870
Once this job is over...

367
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,670
- Didn't you tell him?
 -  I did.

368
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,240
I want to hear it from you.

369
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,140
I'll rehire you under me with a 20 percent increase on your salary.

370
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,870
You'll become my family.

371
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,110
Thank you.

372
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,510
Do you think we can trust Soo Tak?

373
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,970
He had a difficult childhood, so he has strong desires for success.

374
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,010
We'll write ours with five percent less in royalties.

375
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,310
Are you letting him win on purpose?

376
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,600
We'll leave in two hours.

377
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,910
Don't let Soo Yeon find out.

378
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,540
Okay.

379
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Gi Tan.

380
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,940
Let's end our match here.

381
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,940
(Advanced correction for the better of the future)

382
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,240
- Boss.
 -  Boss.

383
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,440
I told you not to act like you know me.

384
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,430
How can we not?

385
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,040
You're as high as the skies to me.

386
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
The skies?

387
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,910
Why would you spit at the skies?

388
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,540
I need to speak to you about that.

389
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,230
Forget it.

390
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,810
Aren't you curious about who did this to you?

391
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,360
What do you mean?

392
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,540
You have a traitor amongst your closest people.

393
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,040
He's the reason why you're in here.

394
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,940
Well, who is it?

395
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,210
If you can get them to put me...

396
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,370
in your cell,

397
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,470
I'll tell you then.

398
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,570
You want to come to my cell?

399
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,940
I miss our old days.

400
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,270
Please give me another chance.

401
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,210
There's no reason for you to stay here overnight.

402
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,040
I thought you said it'd take days to convince Professor Na.

403
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,040
Soo Tak and I can do it.

404
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,210
Book the best room here.

405
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,340
Check her in. I'll find out where Professor Na is staying.

406
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,010
Okay.

407
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,210
Professor Na.

408
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,200
Chae Ryung. You're as talented as I thought.

409
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,560
You found me so fast.

410
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,640
I won't beat around the bush.

411
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,770
Just give us the MK2 vaccine.

412
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,710
I was on a roll. Don't jinx me.

413
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,740
What are you doing? Go ahead.

414
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,270
Do you want to die?

415
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,240
I know you people are scary.

416
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,340
But money scares me more.

417
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,950
Money isn't more precious than life.

418
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,010
You can't kill me.

419
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,710
I got rid of every documentation...

420
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,170
on the MK2 vaccine.

421
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,310
It's all gone.

422
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,810
There is no MK2 vaccine any more.

423
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,370
Where do you think it went then?

424
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,040
Right in here. It's in my head.

425
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,910
Do you want to kill me?

426
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,670
Are you willing to throw away billions of dollars...

427
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,610
for it?

428
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,200
Tell your boss this.

429
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,970
I'll return his advancement money with the penalty fee.

430
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,210
I had fun.

431
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,540
Are you Professor Na?

432
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,390
- And you?
 -  I'm from Dodo Group.

433
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,410
(Kang Gi Tan)

434
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,270
Gi Tan.

435
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,940
What? The MK2 vaccine...

436
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,200
is the mutant virus' vaccine?

437
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
You have to help us.

438
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,210
If we don't get the blueprints back,

439
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,240
the organisation will terminate us.

440
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,740
Things really got tangled up.

441
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,510
Tell me all you know about Na Do Gwang.

442
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,000
Are you going to help us?

443
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,540
There's no reason for me to help Dodo Group.

444
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,770
You've helped me so far.

445
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,990
I should pay you back.

446
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,040
Thank you.

447
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,370
What's wrong?

448
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,340
I thought I heard shutter sounds.

449
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,010
I didn't hear anything.

450
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,530
That man on the piano is Professor Na.

451
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,280
I wouldn't have expected it, but he's really good.

452
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,400
Most of the customers here...

453
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,570
are people from different pharmaceutical companies.

454
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,430
Professor Na's hobbies are gambling and piano.

455
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,520
- Anything else?
 -  He dislikes women.

456
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,340
He was conned a few times.

457
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,020
Why waste time? Let's sign the contract.

458
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,780
You should stay out of it.

459
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,900
Why?

460
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,040
I got a tip that Do Gwang dislikes women.

461
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,340
It depends on the woman.

462
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,640
Watch me put on my charm.

463
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,110
That lady bought you a drink.

464
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,040
She just got rejected.

465
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Gi Tan, look.

466
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,010
May I join you?

467
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,310
Of course.

468
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,610
C16H30O.

469
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,140
You wear a nice perfume.

470
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,740
I apologise for what I did earlier. I dislike cocktails.

471
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,540
I see.

472
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,140
Thank you for the lovely music.

473
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,690
I'd never heard that piece before.

474
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,840
You know your music.

475
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,570
I wrote it myself.

476
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,310
I'm glad you liked it.

477
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,670
Did you write it?

478
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,970
I thought you only did research, but you write music, too.

479
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,820
Who are you?

480
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,040
Sorry for the late introduction.

481
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,510
This is about business.

482
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,110
I don't read the contracts myself.

483
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,340
Hand yours to my assistant. Goodbye.

484
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,240
I don't do things myself.

485
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,340
My assistant does the work for me.

486
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,440
Let's let our assistants do all the work.

487
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,170
Would you like a drink with me?

488
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,110
How about a bottle of whiskey?

489
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,170
I was afraid she'd make a mess of it.

490
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,520
She's not bad with people.

491
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,540
You're right.

492
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,740
Where's Gi Tan?

493
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,710
He's in the lounge.

494
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,540
Cheers.

495
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,140
Excuse me. Are you Professor Na?

496
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,100
Why do you ask?

497
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,740
I'm Do Gun Woo, Vice Chairman of Dodo Group's SPD.

498
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,040
These are our conditions. I hope you review them.

499
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,040
What do you think you're doing?

500
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Don't you see me?

501
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,940
You're from the same company. Aren't you a team?

502
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,730
We aren't. He's just a...

503
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,430
We're two separate teams.

504
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,460
Our conditions will be different.

505
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,610
My business card's inside. I hope to hear from you.

506
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,840
Competition within the company...

507
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,840
I'll call you when I'm ready.

508
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,380
Goodbye.

509
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,010
Are you leaving already? The bottle isn't empty yet.

510
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,140
Give me your contract.

511
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,610
Here it is, Sir.

512
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,310
Goodbye.

513
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,510
Thank you for taking me back.

514
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,530
I will serve you with my life.

515
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,470
Forget about all that.

516
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,470
Finish what you were saying earlier today.

517
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,440
Who betrayed me?

518
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,210
Byun Il Jae.

519
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,700
What? My brother-in-law?

520
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,480
Don't even call him that.

521
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,040
He colluded with the prosecutor to put you behind bars.

522
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,460
What for?

523
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,310
I don't know why.

524
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,080
He told me to cooperate in exchange for a shorter sentence.

525
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,710
That's why I wasn't able to tell you until now.

526
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,380
You mean...

527
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,880
I let Il Jae use me.

528
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,160
Like a fool.

529
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,570
You let people take advantage of you like some idiot...

530
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,510
I apologise.

531
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,240
I have to add...

532
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,420
one more name on my hit list.

533
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,170
Oh, and that other guy.

534
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,340
Kang Gi Tan.

535
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,710
He's one of them.

536
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,330
What? Gi Tan as well?

537
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,640
He's Il Jae's right-hand man.

538
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,270
Yes, Kang Gi Tan...

539
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,040
You wait and see.

540
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,270
The day I get out, all of you...

541
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,240
will be taught a lesson.

542
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,010
Are you sure you can beat me?

543
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,510
If I weren't sure,

544
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,320
I wouldn't have come to this dump.

545
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,240
Gi Tan has taught you a lot. You care about business now.

546
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,400
Where's Soo Yeon?

547
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,410
You kept her so close until now.

548
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,440
She's very busy trying to revive our company.

549
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,880
Have you heard the rumour?

550
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,770
They say you're her sponsor.

551
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,370
What? Is it wrong to look out for someone poor?

552
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,710
Watch what you say.

553
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,590
Why is she poor?

554
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,900
What did you just say?

555
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,210
Fire me if you want. I don't mind.

556
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,670
Do you think I can't?

557
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,520
If you dare touch him,

558
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,140
we'll see who gets fired first.

559
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,510
You two make a lovely couple.

560
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,560
So do you and Soo Yeon.

561
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,700
Good luck with her.

562
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,710
Thanks.

563
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,910
How long does he need to read our contracts?

564
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,540
You sound confident.

565
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,820
I'm just curious.

566
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,740
I wonder who Do Gwang will sign with.

567
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,210
(Do Gun Woo)

568
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,970
(Kang Gi Tan)

569
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,740
Kang Gi Tan speaking.

570
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,610
I'll come right up.

571
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,830
Was it him?

572
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,040
I guess he liked our offer.

573
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,610
I'll be right back.

574
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,410
Yes!

575
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,810
See? I said we'd win.

576
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,540
- Drink up. Bottom's up.
 -  Yes, Ma'am.

577
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,710
Gi Tan.

578
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,140
I will make you shed tears of blood very soon.

579
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,810
Manager Kang. Have a seat.

580
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,210
Does this mean I decide what I want?

581
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,670
Yes.

582
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,930
What if I demand too much?

583
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,630
Whatever it is that you want, it can never be too much.

584
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,430
The bear who does the tricks should take most of the profit.

585
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,740
That is only fair.

586
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,270
As the developer of the vaccine, that's a very important issue to me.

587
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,340
You seem to understand.

588
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,940
I respect and honour your demands.

589
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,740
Use that pen to write whatever it is you want.

590
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,070
I have some beer in the fridge. Do you want some?

591
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,510
- Yes, thank you.
 -  Just a moment.

592
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,210
Isn't that what you played?

593
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,610
I've never seen a music sheet like that.

594
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,560
Did you compose that piece?

595
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,070
I really dislike it when...

596
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,040
others touch my belongings.

597
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,270
I apologise.

598
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,070
Can I have the beer?

599
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,070
There's no need to apologise. I'm sorry.

600
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,810
I'm tired, so I overreacted.

601
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,170
I heard you like to play games.

602
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,730
Would you like to play baccarat tomorrow?

603
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,510
I never say no to gambling.

604
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,710
Here you go.

605
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,770
Just a moment.

606
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,900
Can I use your bathroom?

607
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,470
Sure. It's down that way.

608
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,210
I'm Do Gun Woo, Vice Chairman of Dodo Group.

609
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,910
- I'm listening.
 -  Did you see the photo?

610
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,930
Kang Gi Tan is a member of Huaping, a group Ok Chae Ryung belongs to.

611
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,770
He approached you to get the vaccine.

612
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,860
I'm at the bar in the basement.

613
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,810
I'll see you here in an hour.

614
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,260
Shall I get more beer?

615
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,540
No. Actually...

616
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,770
I'm very tired.

617
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,310
Could we meet again tomorrow?

618
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,140
Of course.

619
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,630
The music sheet is the vaccine blueprint?

620
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,930
He got very upset when I touched it.

621
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,500
I think I'm right.

622
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,100
How can musical notes represent a chemical formula?

623
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,170
I thought about it.

624
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,900
There are a little over 100 chemical elements.

625
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,370
There are 88 keys on a piano.

626
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,770
The sheet music...

627
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,130
included notes that aren't on a standard piano.

628
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,210
Cha Woo and I will try to get our hands on it.

629
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,070
You can stop now.

630
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,510
He's closely watched.

631
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:35,270
The professor trusts me, so I should wrap up...

632
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,070
What is it?

633
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,210
I heard someone.

634
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,310
Thanks for helping out today.

635
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,810
I was glad when you agreed to help so willingly.

636
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,310
Shouldn't you leave Huaping?

637
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,310
It's my destiny.

638
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,700
I can't leave until I die.

639
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,940
If this works out, try talking to your boss.

640
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,940
The work is taking its toll on you.

641
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:27,310
Now that we don't need your blood, you won't want to see me.

642
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,010
I want to live a normal life.

643
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,510
You should go home.

644
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,370
I know where the vaccine's blueprint is.

645
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,240
The music sheet Do Gwang has...

646
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,240
That's it.

647
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,210
Good job.

648
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,510
It just got much easier.

649
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,110
Tell Soo Tak to get ready.

650
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,840
Yes, Sir.

651
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,940
Make Gi Tan drink this.

652
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,440
It's spiked with a sedative.

653
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,960
- A sedative?
 -  Our vice chairman...

654
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,900
will finalise the deal tonight.

655
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,940
We can't let Gi Tan interrupt,

656
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,770
so we'll put him to sleep.

657
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,670
I don't believe this.

658
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:59,260
He can't be a spy.

659
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,940
All you have to do is drink and have a good night's sleep.

660
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,770
Then you'll get to take the credit for the whole thing.

661
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,970
What's this?

662
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:20,440
I brought a bottle from home to share with you.

663
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:24,230
I had a lot of beer. I don't want any more.

664
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,730
Come on, don't say that.

665
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,570
I brought this for you.

666
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,670
Okay, then. Let's just have a little.

667
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,870
A toast to a successful deal.

668
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:39,840
Cheers.

669
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,670
Soo Tak.

670
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,440
Are you drunk already?

671
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,270
(Kim Hae Il)

672
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,660
I got Gi Tan's fingerprint.

673
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,470
Give it to Oh Choong Dong.

674
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,910
- I apologise.
 -  It's fine.

675
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,240
If it hadn't been for you,

676
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,540
I could've gotten into trouble.

677
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,610
Get rid of Do Gwang.

678
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,070
Sorry?

679
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,270
The MK2 vaccine...

680
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:32,210
will earn us more money than you can ever imagine.

681
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,940
The 50 million that Gi Tan took is nothing compared to that.

682
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,010
If we're to make a profit,

683
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:42,070
we have to kill Professor Na...

684
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,810
and pin it on Gi Tan.

685
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,010
Gun Woo plans to make Gi Tan look like an industrial spy.

686
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,160
If he finds out we killed him, he could retaliate...

687
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,470
He can't do anything about spilt milk.

688
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,640
He won't be able to think of a way to turn things around.

689
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,770
I'm ready.

690
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,960
Let's sign the contract.

691
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,040
But...

692
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:18,470
you offered 20 percent of the total profit,

693
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,400
and that's not quite enough.

694
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,580
I will offer you the blank cheque deal...

695
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,940
that Gi Tan did.

696
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,680
Do you mean that?

697
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,220
My father is Chairman Do Choong.

698
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,490
Does that help?

699
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,410
It does.

700
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,540
In exchange,

701
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,210
promise me that...

702
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,810
you won't consider any other contract.

703
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,810
Cheers.

704
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,170
Goodnight, Sir.

705
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,800
Mr Choi, you all had a long day. You can retire for the night.

706
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,870
Wake me up at 7am tomorrow.

707
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:45,330
That's it for the day. Get some rest.

708
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,440
- Okay.
 -  Okay.

709
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,880
How did it go?

710
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,970
It's a success.

711
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,310
Well done.

712
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,270
I brought dumplings, your favourite.

713
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,060
Where is Guk Cheol?

714
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,340
I miss Guk Cheol.

715
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,500
Guk Cheol isn't with us any more.

716
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,780
What?

717
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:14,810
No.

718
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,780
Stop it, Dong Soo. What's wrong?

719
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,760
Why don't you be honest? You don't want...

720
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,070
Soo Yeon to find out that Gi Tan is Guk Cheol.

721
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,860
Why don't you be honest? You don't want...

722
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,040
Soo Yeon to find out that Gi Tan is Guk Cheol.

723
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:32,240
What are you talking about?

724
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:38,910
Is Gi Tan...

725
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,970
Guk Cheol?

726
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,410
Yes.

727
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,440
Tell me.

728
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:47,940
Is Gi Tan...

729
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,710
really Guk Cheol?

730
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,470
Yes. Guk Cheol.

731
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,270
He cried.

732
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,470
Did Gi Tan...

733
00:58:58,210 --> 00:58:59,540
cry in front of you?

734
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,440
He cried.

735
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,070
Guk Cheol cried.

736
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,040
I miss Guk Cheol.

737
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,440
I miss Guk Cheol.

738
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,440
(Oh Soo Yeon)

739
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,740
Guk Cheol, I'm Jeong Eun.

740
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:50,710
Please pick up.

741
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,310
(Oh Soo Yeon)

742
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,170
You mean Gi Tan...

743
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,510
is your friend from a long time ago?

744
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,540
Yes.

745
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,010
No wonder.

746
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:33,710
I could tell that he liked you a lot.

747
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,640
That explains a lot.

748
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,110
But why didn't he tell you?

749
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:47,910
Whatever the reason, he tried very hard to help you.

750
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:52,040
He's the one who settled Dong Soo's hospital bills.

751
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,390
The Hwang Hae Hotel in Incheon?

752
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,370
He said he'd be there on business.

753
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,170
Why aren't you picking up?

754
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:52,710
Professor Na.

755
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,440
Professor Na.

756
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,070
Professor.

757
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,140
Professor.

758
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,540
Are you awake?

759
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,070
Professor!

760
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,370
Is something wrong?

761
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,240
Open the door!

762
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,940
He's still alive.

763
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:28,810
Call 911!

764
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,310
Get him first.

765
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,010
Professor.

766
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,610
Professor.

767
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:34,970
Professor.

768
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,690
Professor. Who hurt you?

769
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,890
Tell us!

770
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,040
Who did this?

771
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:50,410
Professor!

772
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:21,600
(Monster)

773
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,190
Go and tell Il Jae that...

774
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:24,800
he picked on the wrong guy.

775
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,290
You shouldn't have gotten involved, Gun Woo.

776
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:29,690
The chairman wants to help Gi Tan.

777
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:31,660
I need your help, Mr Hwang.

778
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,600
To catch a big fish,

779
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,800
you need to learn to let go of the little ones.

780
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,430
Will that make you the next chairman of Dodo Group?

781
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:42,140
Let me out! Let me out!

782
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,710
Let me out of here this instant!
