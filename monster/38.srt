2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,490
<font color="yellow">You look beat up.</font>

3
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,560
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,330
<font color="yellow">Who beat up the Seoul mayor?</font>

5
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,490
<font color="yellow">If I tell you,</font>

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,330
<font color="yellow">are you going to get them back for me?</font>

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,530
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,260
<font color="yellow">How dare they touch my precious meal?</font>

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,590
<font color="yellow">Was it Gun Woo?</font>

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,160
<font color="yellow">I guess I got it right.</font>

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,160
<font color="yellow">You must be really hurt...</font>

12
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,530
<font color="yellow">to get stabbed in the back.</font>

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,960
<font color="yellow">I know very well how that feels.</font>

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,460
<font color="yellow">I've been betrayed by people before, too.</font>

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,230
<font color="yellow">How did you get stuck in solitary confinement?</font>

16
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,490
<font color="yellow">Seoul Mayor is now in solitary confinement...</font>

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,690
<font color="yellow">Your life is so pathetic.</font>

18
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,360
<font color="yellow">It's too early for you to celebrate. Don't make me laugh.</font>

19
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,860
<font color="yellow">Do you know why a food chain exists?</font>

20
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,690
<font color="yellow">It's not because the weak committed a crime.</font>

21
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,430
<font color="yellow">That's just how the food pyramid is built.</font>

22
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,830
<font color="yellow">Money and power determine who goes to the top of the pyramid.</font>

23
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,060
<font color="yellow">I've let my place go for a moment,</font>

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,530
<font color="yellow">but I still have power left in me.</font>

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,230
<font color="yellow">I'll be out soon, Guk Cheol.</font>

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,160
<font color="yellow">B World.</font>

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
<font color="yellow">Your goose that lays golden eggs...</font>

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,160
<font color="yellow">will soon be put to death.</font>

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,860
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat that goose, and that will be the end of it.</font>

30
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,960
<font color="yellow">Your supporter Hwang Jae Man will abandon you without B World.</font>

31
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,790
<font color="yellow">I'm curious to see how you'll get out of jail.</font>

32
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,830
<font color="yellow">Enjoy, Uncle.</font>

33
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,990
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

34
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,100
<font color="yellow">my last goodwill to you.</font>

35
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,590
<font color="yellow">Kang Gi Tan...</font>

36
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,290
<font color="yellow">Do Gun Woo!</font>

37
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,260
<font color="yellow">Mum, what do you think about this jacket? It's for today's meeting.</font>

38
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,430
<font color="yellow">I think it's the new blood pressure medication he started taking.</font>

39
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,520
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with the new medication?</font>

40
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,660
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem to suit him. Also, the stress must have...</font>

41
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,330
<font color="yellow">caused a temporary mental derangement.</font>

42
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,050
<font color="yellow">By temporary, do you mean that he'll be back to normal?</font>

43
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,190
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's not dementia, so please do not worry.</font>

44
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,400
<font color="yellow">Can he still attend the general meeting?</font>

45
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,430
<font color="yellow">I think we should wait and see when he wakes up.</font>

46
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,330
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

47
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,590
<font color="yellow">Come on, what do you think? Is it too much?</font>

48
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,940
<font color="yellow">Tell your father to come out for his meal.</font>

49
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,050
<font color="yellow">Are you going to make him food?</font>

50
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,360
<font color="yellow">I need to check how he's doing.</font>

51
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,060
<font color="yellow">Okay. All right.</font>

52
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,160
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

53
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,230
<font color="yellow">you can attend the general meeting today?</font>

54
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,660
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

55
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,030
<font color="yellow">I won't do you a favour by not going.</font>

56
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,060
<font color="yellow">Dr Hwang was right.</font>

57
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,860
<font color="yellow">Why does he have to be normal today?</font>

58
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,960
<font color="yellow">You're not very well.</font>

59
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,140
<font color="yellow">I think you should rest today.</font>

60
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,460
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to just sit and watch...</font>

61
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,160
<font color="yellow">while the two of you try to steal my money away?</font>

62
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,890
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant. I was just worried about you.</font>

63
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,690
<font color="yellow">When this general meeting is over, you two will get...</font>

64
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,590
<font color="yellow">what you deserve!</font>

65
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,760
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

66
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,860
<font color="yellow">No one will care about you even if you come.</font>

67
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,960
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

68
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,460
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Mother eating?</font>

69
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,460
<font color="yellow">Father...</font>

70
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,330
<font color="yellow">Go and get her right away.</font>

71
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,960
<font color="yellow">I should greet her before I'm off to work.</font>

72
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,890
<font color="yellow">Chairman...</font>

73
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,060
<font color="yellow">Your mother...</font>

74
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,470
<font color="yellow">didn't want to eat because there's no meat today.</font>

75
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,560
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you make any meat dishes?</font>

76
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,860
<font color="yellow">This is the reason why I'm always being scolded!</font>

77
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,790
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Honey.</font>

78
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,760
<font color="yellow">We ran out of meat today.</font>

79
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,060
<font color="yellow">Go and buy some meat right now.</font>

80
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,860
<font color="yellow">If you don't, I won't let you...</font>

81
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,490
<font color="yellow">step inside my house!</font>

82
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,430
<font color="yellow">Did you see that?</font>

83
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,160
<font color="yellow">This is how your father treated me all these years.</font>

84
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,830
<font color="yellow">He treated me like a maid and a slave.</font>

85
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,830
<font color="yellow">He was arrogant and commanding.</font>

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
<font color="yellow">We won't have to worry about today's general meeting.</font>

87
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,290
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

88
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,430
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mum.</font>

89
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,990
<font color="yellow">She's gone. You should finish your meal.</font>

90
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,060
<font color="yellow">That witch.</font>

91
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,460
<font color="yellow">How can she treat my mother like that?</font>

92
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,530
<font color="yellow">- I told you, she's gone.
-  This is a problem.</font>

93
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,140
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take Mother out for a meal.</font>

94
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,740
<font color="yellow">Go and get prepared.</font>

95
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,360
<font color="yellow">Sir, your mother passed away.</font>

96
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,260
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

97
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,530
<font color="yellow">I just said goodnight to her last night!</font>

98
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,460
<font color="yellow">Weren't you putting up an act?</font>

99
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,830
<font color="yellow">Your mother died 20 years ago.</font>

100
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,420
<font color="yellow">What do you mean my mother died?</font>

101
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,530
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

102
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,890
<font color="yellow">She suffered so much.</font>

103
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,150
<font color="yellow">I was going to treat her well now. What do you mean she died?</font>

104
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,160
<font color="yellow">No, Sir. I'll go and get her right away.</font>

105
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,160
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

106
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,090
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

107
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,190
<font color="yellow">You were...</font>

108
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,690
<font color="yellow">just joking, right?</font>

109
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,630
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

110
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,060
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

111
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,660
<font color="yellow">Go and get Mother. Go on.</font>

112
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,260
<font color="yellow">It's me, Gun Woo.</font>

113
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,160
<font color="yellow">The chairman has really gone strange.</font>

114
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,160
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's temporary.</font>

115
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,360
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's not dementia?</font>

116
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,860
<font color="yellow">Why would I lie to you?</font>

117
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,660
<font color="yellow">Then what is this shot for?</font>

118
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,830
<font color="yellow">It's a kind of sedative to reduce your anxiety.</font>

119
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,500
<font color="yellow">You can attend the general meeting since you got the shot.</font>

120
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,160
<font color="yellow">I knew it. It's impossible...</font>

121
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,670
<font color="yellow">to get dementia at this age.</font>

122
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,690
<font color="yellow">Please rest up.</font>

123
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,500
<font color="yellow">The general meeting is at 4pm today, so rest up until then.</font>

124
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,590
<font color="yellow">Who else has seen the video...</font>

125
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,160
<font color="yellow">of her switching pills?</font>

126
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,690
<font color="yellow">Just the shareholders on our side.</font>

127
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,660
<font color="yellow">I guess it won't be leaked then.</font>

128
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,590
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

129
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,360
<font color="yellow">What's your plan?</font>

130
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,690
<font color="yellow">You know that your father won't be at the general meeting, right?</font>

131
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,630
<font color="yellow">Didn't Mr Gong call you?</font>

132
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,890
<font color="yellow">He's on and off. It's impossible for him to leave home.</font>

133
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,260
<font color="yellow">How can we let him be the chairman in that condition?</font>

134
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,090
<font color="yellow">I don't need him there, so don't worry.</font>

135
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,630
<font color="yellow">You're still so proud, aren't you? You're just like your father.</font>

136
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,760
<font color="yellow">How disgusting.</font>

137
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,600
<font color="yellow">- Did you find yourself a house yet?
-  What house?</font>

138
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,930
<font color="yellow">Father told me that he told you to move out.</font>

139
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,290
<font color="yellow">I guess you didn't start looking yet.</font>

140
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,260
<font color="yellow">How did he even remember to tell you that?</font>

141
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,530
<font color="yellow">Your mum's life came to an end because she trusted him too much.</font>

142
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,360
<font color="yellow">You should find another way to live, too.</font>

143
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,730
<font color="yellow">You're so pathetic and poor.</font>

144
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,130
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

145
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,930
<font color="yellow">I guess today is...</font>

146
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,090
<font color="yellow">the last day I'll see you.</font>

147
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,030
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

148
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,590
<font color="yellow">we have 4 hours and 47 minutes until the general meeting.</font>

149
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,660
<font color="yellow">Do you want to resign beforehand?</font>

150
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,060
<font color="yellow">If so, I'll give you a lot of severance pay...</font>

151
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,460
<font color="yellow">so that you can live the rest of your life doing nothing.</font>

152
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,560
<font color="yellow">It's detestable...</font>

153
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,030
<font color="yellow">to see a broken family like us.</font>

154
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,160
<font color="yellow">You can find a way to live,</font>

158
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,590

<font color="yellow">I did and he does have dementia.</font>

270

<font color="yellow">It is dementia?</font>

271
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, he definitely has dementia.</font>

<font color="yellow">If I do the same thing Il Jae did to me,</font>

311
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,860
<font color="yellow">that wouldn't be revenge.</font>

312
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,460
<font color="yellow">My revenge...</font>

313
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,560
<font color="yellow">will be more beautiful...</font>

314
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,700
<font color="yellow">and classy.</font>

315
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,590
<font color="yellow">I gave you my warning.</font>

316
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,160
<font color="yellow">I told you to let go of Il Jae.</font>

317
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,460
<font color="yellow">You have a great set of lawyers lined up.</font>

318
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,890
<font color="yellow">I admit, I was amazed.</font>

319
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,230
<font color="yellow">If he gets probation or acquittal, your name will be added...</font>

320
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,160
<font color="yellow">to my hit list.</font>

321
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,730
<font color="yellow">The day his mayoral position was nullified,</font>

322
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,390
<font color="yellow">you already went on my hit list.</font>

323
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,120
<font color="yellow">I guess one of us will have to disappear then.</font>

324
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,930
<font color="yellow">You're holding the key right now.</font>

325
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,700
<font color="yellow">If you give up on the revenge,</font>

326
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,210
<font color="yellow">there won't be any fights.</font>

327
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,490
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

328
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,860
<font color="yellow">My fight already started.</font>

329
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,360
<font color="yellow">I ate dog food when I was a homeless.</font>

330
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,560
<font color="yellow">I will never forget its taste.</font>

331
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,360
<font color="yellow">That's why I plan on letting Il Jae try some.</font>

332
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,560
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what I'm talking about?</font>

333
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,230
<font color="yellow">I'll turn...</font>

334
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,590
<font color="yellow">Il Jae into a homeless.</font>

335
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,360
<font color="yellow">He'll be poor and useless.</font>

336
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,130
<font color="yellow">Just abandon him then.</font>

337
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,630
<font color="yellow">That's the only chance you can avoid...</font>

338

341
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,260
<font color="yellow">You sold all of your Dodo Pharmaceutical shares.</font>

342
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,960

344
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,130

345
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,760
<font color="yellow">Come sit at the front with me.</font>

346
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,130

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,060
<font color="yellow">I can if I want to. Leave me alone.</font>

353
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,560
<font color="yellow">Just let her be.</font>

-  Pardon?</font>

368
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,390
<font color="yellow">This is urgent. You need to contact him as soon as possible.</font>

369
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,530
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

370

<font color="yellow">Where is Chairman Do Choong?</font>

372
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,130
<font color="yellow">His condition has gotten worse. He won't be able to attend.</font>

373
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,230
<font color="yellow">I heard that he was getting better.</font>

374
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,260
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure who is spreading such rumours,</font>

375
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,490
<font color="yellow">but he can barely take care of himself.</font>

376
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,590
<font color="yellow">What is his condition? How bad is it?</font>

377
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,920
<font color="yellow">That's his privacy, so I'll tell you in person later.</font>

378
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,530
<font color="yellow">Just know that he won't be able to attend today.</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

390
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,260

391
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,960
<font color="yellow">You're not well. Why did you bother coming here?</font>

392

<font color="yellow">Mr Han.</font>

393
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,590

00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,830

400
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,660
<font color="yellow">I'm healthy as I can be.</font>

401
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,160
<font color="yellow">Don't be fooled.</font>

402
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,660
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do Choong has dementia.</font>

403
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,560
<font color="yellow">Dementia?</font>

404
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,460
<font color="yellow">I don't have dementia.</font>

405
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,030
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

406
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,730
<font color="yellow">It's a crime to lie to our shareholders.</font>

407
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,860
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo, check where Dr Hwang is.</font>

408
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,260
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,130
<font color="yellow">Dr Hwang. Where are you right now?</font>

410
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,160
<font color="yellow">I see. He's almost here.</font>

411
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,410
<font color="yellow">Once his doctor arrives,</font>

412
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,130
<font color="yellow">you'll all find out that he has dementia.</font>

413
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,230
<font color="yellow">Even if he's the founder,</font>

414
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,490
<font color="yellow">we can't let someone with dementia run the company.</font>

415
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,060
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree?</font>

416
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,360
<font color="yellow">May I ask you a question, Chairwoman Hwang?</font>

417
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,260
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead.
-  During your tenure,</font>

418
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,260
<font color="yellow">there was zero improvement in the company's performance.</font>

419
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,860
<font color="yellow">Why don't you explain yourself?</font>

420
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sure all of you know that the business sector is in depression.</font>

421
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,620
<font color="yellow">Our rival Geukdong Group was in the red.</font>

422
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,790
<font color="yellow">Same goes for Samjoong Group and Taeyang Group.</font>

423
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,390
<font color="yellow">It was thanks to me we managed to stay afloat. If someone else...</font>

424
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,390
<font color="yellow">Chairwoman Hwang!</font>

425
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,960
<font color="yellow">Is it currently...</font>

426
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,000
<font color="yellow">worse than when we had IMF?</font>

427
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,160
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

428
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,130
<font color="yellow">During IMF,</font>

429
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,230
<font color="yellow">numerous companies went bankrupt!</font>

430
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,130
<font color="yellow">But I expanded by creating 10 more subsidiary companies.</font>

431
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,260
<font color="yellow">Our growth rate was 145 percent!</font>

432
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,830
<font color="yellow">It's still considered a legend in the industry.</font>

433
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,830
<font color="yellow">I found Dodo Media then.</font>

434
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,490
<font color="yellow">Where is Mr Choi?</font>

435
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,460

<font color="yellow">All of you! What happened to you?</font>

442
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,790
<font color="yellow">We used to sweat and cry together!</font>

443
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,360
<font color="yellow">We'd debate over drinks...</font>

444
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,630
<font color="yellow">and support each other as a team!</font>

445
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,160
<font color="yellow">Why can't you work like you used to?</font>

446
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir. It's our fault.</font>

447
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,730
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

448
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

449
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,590
<font color="yellow">I couldn't hold my place.</font>

450
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,130
<font color="yellow">This all happened because...</font>

451
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,990
<font color="yellow">I was too weak.</font>

452
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,790
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault, Chairman.</font>

453
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
<font color="yellow">Please return, Sir.</font>

454
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,460
<font color="yellow">We missed you, Sir.</font>

455
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,630
<font color="yellow">Chairwoman Hwang.</font>

456
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,190

<font color="yellow">Dodo Group is...</font>

458
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,790
<font color="yellow">all about those memories!</font>

459
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,560
<font color="yellow">It's sustained by our blood, sweat and efforts...</font>

460
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,530
<font color="yellow">from those days.</font>

461

<font color="yellow">People like you...</font>

462
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,860
<font color="yellow">will never know what it's like!</font>

621
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,760
<font color="yellow">Please tell us.</font>

622
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,730
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

623
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,520
<font color="yellow">Who is he marrying?</font>

624
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,460
<font color="yellow">They said he's marrying Soo Yeon.</font>

625
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,560
<font color="yellow">It's a rumour that's been spreading.</font>

626
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,660
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

627
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,730
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

628
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,260
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

629
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,630
<font color="yellow">Am I to spread a rumour on your marriage with Lawyer Oh?</font>

630
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,260
<font color="yellow">Yes, spread rumours about it.</font>

631
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,530
<font color="yellow">Mention it to the reporters today as well.</font>

632
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,660
<font color="yellow">So many people would want to drink with you today.</font>

633
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,260
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to drink at a place like this?</font>

634
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,060
<font color="yellow">I like to drink with you at a place like this.</font>

635
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,060
<font color="yellow">I'll become the chairman of Dodo Group soon.</font>

636
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,960
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

637
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,930
<font color="yellow">I'll congratulate you in advance.</font>

638
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:57,130
<font color="yellow">That means I'll be very busy with work.</font>

639
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,360
<font color="yellow">Did you expect it to be all fun and games?</font>

640
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,190
<font color="yellow">I want to scream, shout and jump up and down.</font>

641
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,430
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy I want to act like a madman!</font>

642
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,660
<font color="yellow">Don't. My neighbours will report you right away.</font>

643
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,100
<font color="yellow">I tried so hard to hold it back.</font>

644
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,230
<font color="yellow">But I just can't tonight.</font>

645
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,630
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, you're the only woman who makes...</font>

646
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,260
<font color="yellow">my heart beat faster.</font>

647
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,030
<font color="yellow">The only one in the world.</font>

648
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,730
<font color="yellow">That's you.</font>

649
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,030
<font color="yellow">Marry me.</font>

650
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,530
<font color="yellow">- Gun Woo.
-  I know I'm rushing it.</font>

651
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,760
<font color="yellow">I'll wait.</font>

652
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,260
<font color="yellow">Whether it be 10 years or 100.</font>

653
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,330
<font color="yellow">Until you say yes.</font>

654
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,690
<font color="yellow">What made you want to drink at a place like this?</font>

655
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,100
<font color="yellow">If I lived an average life,</font>

656
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,460
<font color="yellow">would I be happy like everyone else?</font>

657
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,930
<font color="yellow">Ever since I was young,</font>

658
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,190
<font color="yellow">I never lacked anything...</font>

659
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,830
<font color="yellow">but I was never happy.</font>

660
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,530
<font color="yellow">Mum and Dad always fought,</font>

661
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,430
<font color="yellow">and Gwang Woo only cared about himself.</font>

662
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,830
<font color="yellow">That's how I ended up caring about what was mine.</font>

663
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,490
<font color="yellow">I'm not used to this.</font>

664
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,230
<font color="yellow">You're like a different person.</font>

665
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,030
<font color="yellow">Should I just get married?</font>

666
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,630
<font color="yellow">That's fine for you, but not your husband.</font>

667
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,860
<font color="yellow">I'll marry you.</font>

668
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,130
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

669
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,630
<font color="yellow">Do you dislike me that much?</font>

670
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,690
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

671
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,630
<font color="yellow">Am I not even worth considering?</font>

672
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,730
<font color="yellow">I'm not capable of loving someone.</font>

673
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,390
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

674
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,330
<font color="yellow">My scars run too deep.</font>

675
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,060
<font color="yellow">So I can't make anyone happy.</font>

676
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,630
<font color="yellow">You don't have to force yourself.</font>

677
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,260
<font color="yellow">I'll make myself happy.</font>

678
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,930
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

679
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,760
<font color="yellow">What has gotten into you?</font>

680
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,620
<font color="yellow">You used to hate it when I got drunk.</font>

681
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,260
<font color="yellow">Today, I think you deserve a drink.</font>

682
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,330
<font color="yellow">Do you trust me now?</font>

683
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,630
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

684
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,490
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

685
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,930
<font color="yellow">I love you to death.</font>

686
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,860
<font color="yellow">Why can't you.</font>

687
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,090
<font color="yellow">Stop screaming in my ear!</font>

688
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,870
<font color="yellow">What? Are you saying you can't stand my singing?</font>

689
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,090
<font color="yellow">You dog bone of a jerk.</font>

690
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,590
<font color="yellow">Leave my ear alone!</font>

691

<font color="yellow">(Do Choong Returns to Dodo)</font>

692
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,660
<font color="yellow">You can't...</font>

693
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,830
<font color="yellow">do this to me.</font>

694
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,390
<font color="yellow">You took from others all your life.</font>

695
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,460
<font color="yellow">How does it feel to lose something?</font>

696
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,730
<font color="yellow">B World.</font>

00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,560
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat it so it can't lay any more.</font>

<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, Gun Woo.</font>

701
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,930
<font color="yellow">You two.</font>

702
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,490
<font color="yellow">I will make you...</font>

706
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,960
<font color="yellow">Give up.</font>

00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,230
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo was tough to beat,</font>

<font color="yellow">Soon, Gun Woo will take over B World.</font>

710
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:08,090
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

711
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:13,960
<font color="yellow">He stabbed me in the back.</font>

712
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,530
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan said he'd make you a beggar.</font>

713
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,260
<font color="yellow">That means he plans to attack B World.</font>

714
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,160
<font color="yellow">That is why I wanted to see you.</font>

715
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,260
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo will purchase B World...</font>

716
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,230
<font color="yellow">for much cheaper than the market price.</font>

717
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,490
<font color="yellow">In exchange for that, ask for the golf course...</font>

00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,190
<font color="yellow">and home shopping channel Ms Hwang promised.</font>

719

<font color="yellow">There's no way...</font>

720
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,490
<font color="yellow">he'd accept that offer.</font>

00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,460
<font color="yellow">In my safe, I have files and evidence...</font>

<font color="yellow">of the corruption Gun Woo committed...</font>

723

<font color="yellow">while he was in management.</font>

00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,160
<font color="yellow">You can use that.</font>

725
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,030
<font color="yellow">I knew it. I knew you wouldn't give in so easily.</font>

726
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,560
<font color="yellow">I'll sell the home shopping channel and golf course for a premium...</font>

727
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,190
<font color="yellow">and invest it in Hong Kong's Z Capital.</font>

<font color="yellow">Z Capital?</font>

729
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,630
<font color="yellow">It's a private equity fund. They're corporate hunters.</font>

<font color="yellow">The money you siphoned away from the paper company.</font>

731
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,160
<font color="yellow">Is that where it went?</font>

732
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,130
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

733
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,970
<font color="yellow">If we put in that much more money,</font>

734
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:37,190
<font color="yellow">then we will have a lot of influence...</font>

735
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,530
<font color="yellow">in where Z Capital invests.</font>

736
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,730
<font color="yellow">While Gi Tan and Gun Woo are fighting over Dodo Group,</font>

737
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,160
<font color="yellow">you will get between them?</font>

738
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,360
<font color="yellow">That's my plan.</font>

739
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:55,160
<font color="yellow">I will see to it that they both go down in flames.</font>

<font color="yellow">Il Jae.</font>

741
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:04,660

742
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:11,160
<font color="yellow">I would like you to do me a favour as well.</font>

743
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,930
<font color="yellow">I will do anything you ask.</font>

744
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,990
<font color="yellow">I will tell you what that is...</font>

745
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,230
<font color="yellow">when you get out of here.</font>

746
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,660
<font color="yellow">What will you ask him to do?</font>

747
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,960
<font color="yellow">Of course, he will fund your campaign.</font>

748
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,390
<font color="yellow">I need him to divorce Ji Soo.</font>

752
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,810
<font color="yellow">I need him not to be my son-in-law any more.</font>

753
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:00,650
<font color="yellow">Will your daughter sign the divorce papers?</font>

754
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,730
<font color="yellow">I will make her sign them, even if it means...</font>

755
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,590
<font color="yellow">threatening to cut ties with her.</font>

756

<font color="yellow">(That is the current trend.)</font>

761
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,030
<font color="yellow">You speak fluent Mandarin.</font>

762
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,160
<font color="yellow">You did well today.</font>

763
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,430
<font color="yellow">Did I really?</font>

764
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,840
<font color="yellow">They seem to like their accommodation.</font>

765
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,030
<font color="yellow">They'd better.</font>

766
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,230
<font color="yellow">I put so much work into their rooms.</font>

767

<font color="yellow">Shouldn't I meet with the shipowners?</font>

768
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:03,960
<font color="yellow">You can talk to me.</font>

<font color="yellow">But from our perspective,</font>

775
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,990
<font color="yellow">it's too large a risk.</font>

776
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,730
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang.</font>

777
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:27,050
<font color="yellow">Even banks these days don't do refund guarantees.</font>

778
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,190
<font color="yellow">That's your problem.</font>

779
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:31,060
<font color="yellow">The shipowners won't sign unless it's a heavy tail payment.</font>

780
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,090
<font color="yellow">It's up to you.</font>

781
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,190
<font color="yellow">There are other shipbuilders.</font>

782
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,230
<font color="yellow">We could help you with the finances.</font>

783
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,960
<font color="yellow">Let us invest.</font>

784
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,160
<font color="yellow">I don't want...</font>

785
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,160
<font color="yellow">to borrow your money, too.</font>

786
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,560
<font color="yellow">What should I tell the shipowners then?</font>

787
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,660
<font color="yellow">Make up your mind. They're impatient people.</font>

788
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,130
<font color="yellow">They can pay us later.</font>

789
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,670
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
-  It's done, then.</font>

790
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,690
<font color="yellow">I'll tell them that.</font>

791
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,160
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

792
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,860
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, wait for me.</font>

793
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,090
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this? It's too risky.</font>

794
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,990
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim, set up a meeting with the bank presidents.</font>

795
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,530
<font color="yellow">Stop Gun Woo from meeting people from the banks.</font>

796
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,390
<font color="yellow">I doubt that will make him come to us for help.</font>

797
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,690
<font color="yellow">Do Choong is back.</font>

798
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,860
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo might ignore me, but he won't.</font>

799
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,390
<font color="yellow">For Shin Young's sake.</font>

800
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,030
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

801
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,890
<font color="yellow">When will you release the MK2 vaccine?</font>

802
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,760
<font color="yellow">First, I'll control their finances.</font>

803
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,990
<font color="yellow">Then I'll go for Dodo Pharmaceutical.</font>

804
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,090
<font color="yellow">If the holding company falls,</font>

805
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,890
<font color="yellow">they will rot from the roots up.</font>

806
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,590
<font color="yellow">Once it starts to rot, even a thousand-year-old tree...</font>

807
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,130
<font color="yellow">will fall in an instant.</font>

808
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,030
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, Gun Woo.</font>

809
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:18,240
<font color="yellow">They'll already be at loggerheads.</font>

810
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,730
<font color="yellow">They just need some fanning.</font>

811
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,330
<font color="yellow">When the fire rages,</font>

812
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,490
<font color="yellow">one of them will go down in flames.</font>

813
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,200
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating?</font>

814
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,430
<font color="yellow">I'd rather eat sand.</font>

815
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,660
<font color="yellow">I have no appetite.</font>

816
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,760
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

817
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:48,390
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

818
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,560
<font color="yellow">where will you stay tonight?</font>

819
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,160
<font color="yellow">Let's go to Dodo Hotel.</font>

820
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,960
<font color="yellow">We'll ask Shin Young to give us a suite.</font>

821
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,330
<font color="yellow">Okay...</font>

822
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,690
<font color="yellow">135 dollars, please.</font>

823
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,490
<font color="yellow">Sure. I can afford that.</font>

824
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:14,090
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

825
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,730
<font color="yellow">The card was suspended.</font>

826
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,480
<font color="yellow">It can't be. It's a premium card.</font>

827
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,530
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable. Fine.</font>

828
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,990
<font color="yellow">Try this one.</font>

829
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,630
<font color="yellow">This is suspended, too.</font>

830
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,960
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

831
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,060
<font color="yellow">Try this one.</font>

832
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,260
<font color="yellow">This, too.</font>

833
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,160
<font color="yellow">Dad must've cut us off.</font>

834
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,690
<font color="yellow">The old mule...</font>

835
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,390
<font color="yellow">How dare he?</font>

836
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,560
<font color="yellow">Calm down or you'll faint again.</font>

837
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,860
<font color="yellow">Do Choong...</font>

838
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,260
<font color="yellow">Il Jae asked me...</font>

839
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,890
<font color="yellow">to give this to you.</font>

840
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,330
<font color="yellow">(Do Gun Woo's slush fund)</font>

841
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,260
<font color="yellow">Tax fraud, lobbying and illegal loans.</font>

842
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,160
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo's management style...</font>

843
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,660
<font color="yellow">is a lot like yours when you were younger.</font>

844
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,190
<font color="yellow">Chimney sweeps get soot all over...</font>

845
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,590
<font color="yellow">and fishmongers reek of fish.</font>

846
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,390
<font color="yellow">A businessman...</font>

847
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,010
<font color="yellow">is bound to touch dirty money.</font>

848
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,830
<font color="yellow">That's what you think.</font>

849
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,530
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

850
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,180
<font color="yellow">rob Il Jae of B World?</font>

851
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,190
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

852
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,430
<font color="yellow">You said the process was sound.</font>

853
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,860
<font color="yellow">When making a deal, both parties...</font>

854
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,060
<font color="yellow">always think they got the worse end.</font>

855
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,260
<font color="yellow">Buying it for half the market price is stealing.</font>

856
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,660
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

857
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,490
<font color="yellow">In exchange for taking B World,</font>

858
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,060
<font color="yellow">I want the golf course in Yongin...</font>

859
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,660
<font color="yellow">and the home shopping channel.</font>

860
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,760
<font color="yellow">Say no, Father.</font>

861
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,790
<font color="yellow">The minute you do,</font>

862
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,430
<font color="yellow">all this will end up in a prosecutor's hands.</font>

863
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:38,130
<font color="yellow">I have proof of Il Jae's corruption as well.</font>

864
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:42,890
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do.</font>

865
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,330
<font color="yellow">I can do...</font>

866
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,160
<font color="yellow">without a son-in-law.</font>

867
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,890
<font color="yellow">But can you do...</font>

868
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,130
<font color="yellow">without a son?</font>

869
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,090
<font color="yellow">Chief Prosecutor Kim.</font>

870
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,760
<font color="yellow">Aren't you busy investigating corruption in large companies?</font>

871
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:12,070
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of giving you a tip.</font>

872
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,370
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

873
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,560
<font color="yellow">Let him be, Father.</font>

874
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,260
<font color="yellow">I said, hang up.</font>

875
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,390
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

876
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,960
<font color="yellow">call you back.</font>

877
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,190
<font color="yellow">The golf course...</font>

878
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,790
<font color="yellow">and the home shopping channel...</font>

879
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,460
<font color="yellow">are yours.</font>

880
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:38,930
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

881
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,430
<font color="yellow">I can't swap you with Il Jae.</font>

882
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,930
<font color="yellow">Get the contract.</font>

883
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

884
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,160
<font color="yellow">It's right here.</font>

885
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,590
<font color="yellow">This clause mentions...</font>

886
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,990
<font color="yellow">the period and amount.</font>

887
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:20,630
<font color="yellow">I got an audio file but I don't know who sent it.</font>

888
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,660
<font color="yellow">Play it.</font>

889
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,560
<font color="yellow">Did you lose the mutant virus vaccine?</font>

890
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,190
<font color="yellow">This is Il Jae's voice.</font>

891
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:34,540
<font color="yellow">It's the MK2 vaccine made with Gi Tan's blood.</font>

892
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,830
<font color="yellow">This is Gun Woo.</font>

893
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,660
<font color="yellow">The Huaping will retaliate.</font>

894
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,900
<font color="yellow">The target...</font>

895
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,360
<font color="yellow">will be on Gi Tan's back, not ours.</font>

896
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,360
<font color="yellow">I will see to it.</font>

897
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,790
<font color="yellow">This confirms that...</font>

898
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,560
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo was the one who framed you...</font>

899
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,260
<font color="yellow">for murder.</font>

900
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,860
<font color="yellow">Who sent this?</font>

901
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,690
<font color="yellow">Il Jae.</font>

902
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:04,460
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

903
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,660
<font color="yellow">To start a fight.</font>

904
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,190
<font color="yellow">He wants us...</font>

905
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:11,130
<font color="yellow">to get rid of Gun Woo.</font>

906
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,760
<font color="yellow">I don't care what Il Jae wants.</font>

907
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,030
<font color="yellow">I now have a clear reason...</font>

908
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,890
<font color="yellow">to get rid of Gun Woo.</font>

909
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:32,330
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd taken B World for cheap.</font>

910
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:35,530
<font color="yellow">But it turns out I had to pay the full price.</font>

911
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,560
<font color="yellow">I'm glad if you think so,</font>

912
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,590
<font color="yellow">but very soon, you'll lose B World.</font>

913
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,250
<font color="yellow">You can't take it from me.</font>

914
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:48,090
<font color="yellow">I won't. Gi Tan will.</font>

915
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,160
<font color="yellow">He told me that...</font>

916
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,590
<font color="yellow">he'll make sure B World goes bankrupt.</font>

917
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,590
<font color="yellow">It would go bankrupt if you had it.</font>

918
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:57,660
<font color="yellow">But I'm not you.</font>

919
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,390
<font color="yellow">No one can touch my company.</font>

920
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:05,050
<font color="yellow">I wondered why Gi Tan was so confident,</font>

921
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,660
<font color="yellow">so I did some digging.</font>

922
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,360
<font color="yellow">He has a powerful weapon with which...</font>

923
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,590
<font color="yellow">he can ruin B World in one blow.</font>

924
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:19,360
<font color="yellow">He plans to sell the vaccine in Korea and America,</font>

925
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,260
<font color="yellow">and he holds the patent for both countries.</font>

926
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:30,120
<font color="yellow">If he sells the MK2 vaccine for scrap value,</font>

927
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,890
<font color="yellow">B World will get pushed out of the competition.</font>

928
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,860
<font color="yellow">Your influenza vaccine will go straight to the dump.</font>

929
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:40,530
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan can ruin you completely.</font>

930
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,760
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is trying to make you go against Chairman Kang.</font>

931
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,390
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

932
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,830
<font color="yellow">Then don't fall for it.</font>

933
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,790
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan is already someone...</font>

934
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,090
<font color="yellow">I must get rid of.</font>

935
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:21,530
<font color="yellow">What Il Jae is doing is giving me one more reason to do so.</font>

936
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,690
<font color="yellow">If I weren't framed for murder,</font>

937
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,390
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have a bullet in my brain.</font>

938
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,600
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo was the one who shot it into me.</font>

939
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,260
<font color="yellow">By turning me into a murderer.</font>

940
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,530
<font color="yellow">(Do Gun Woo)</font>

941
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:53,830
<font color="yellow">I have something to say. Let's meet up.</font>

942
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:57,690
<font color="yellow">Where at?</font>

943
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,130
<font color="yellow">This way, Sir.</font>

944
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,560
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

945
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,130
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

946
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,460
<font color="yellow">To meet Gun Woo.</font>

947
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,660
<font color="yellow">He's in a meeting that will run late.</font>

948
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,190
<font color="yellow">He's the one who asked to see me.</font>

949
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,490
<font color="yellow">Shall we go somewhere for tea?</font>

950
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:21,630
<font color="yellow">I'd like to look around the Strategic Planning Department.</font>

951
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,490
<font color="yellow">I'll see you some other time.</font>

952
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,730
<font color="yellow">Your photo's here.</font>

953
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,930
<font color="yellow">I did pretty well for myself back then.</font>

954
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,930
<font color="yellow">This is a photo of our colleagues.</font>

955
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,860
<font color="yellow">Who's this ugly guy?</font>

956
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,860
<font color="yellow">It's Soo Tak.</font>

957
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,360
<font color="yellow">Now that I see that photo again, I really was ugly.</font>

958
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,490
<font color="yellow">Why is this photo here?</font>

959
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,630
<font color="yellow">Was Soo Yeon an employee here?</font>

960
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:23,730
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

961
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:29,500
<font color="yellow">Were Soo Yeon and I this close?</font>

962
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,930
<font color="yellow">- Well...
-  Kang Gi Tan.</font>

963
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,990
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Soo Yeon.</font>

964
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,190
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

965
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,890
<font color="yellow">forget about her.</font>
