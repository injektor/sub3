00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,710
(Episode 24)

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,540
People fear extreme pain...

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,640
more than death itself.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,370
And that fear makes them tell the truth.

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,810
You can't...

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,140
use pain to change the truth.

7
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,910
Gi Tan!

8
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,340
Gi Tan!

9
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,240
Gi Tan.

10
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,440
What a tenacious one.

11
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,740
He never once begged for his life.

12
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,170
Let me know when you have a lead on Gi Tan's whereabouts.

13
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,440
Okay, thanks, Detective Kim.

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,370
Even the police don't know where Gi Tan is.

15
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,370
Yes, Chae Ryung.

16
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,070
We need to meet now.

17
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,470
- No one followed you, right?
 - Yes.

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,170
I was worried because I couldn't reach you.

19
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,340
What happened to the blueprint?

20
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,440
We're looking for it.

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,870
Do you know where Gi Tan is?

22
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,910
He doesn't have anywhere to hide.

23
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,510
I hope nothing bad happened to him.

24
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,040
Gi Tan's life is in danger.

25
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,220
What do you mean?

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,240
You can save his life only with that blueprint.

27
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,440
Can you explain a little more? What happened to him?

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,840
We haven't much time. Remember what I just told you.

29
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,840
Chae Ryung.

30
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,370
Chae Ryung!

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,240
Is Gi Tan dying?

32
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,640
He's captured by Jo Gi Ryang.

33
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,610
If they don't find the blueprint,

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
it's obvious that he'll die.

35
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,340
In that case, we needn't keep our eyes on Soo Yeon.

36
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,370
Gi Tan is the problem to everything.

37
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,510
There won't be any more problems after he's gone.

38
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,510
(Kim Hae Il)

39
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,370
Yes, speak.

40
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,710
I found someone to decode the blueprint.

41
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,770
Is he trustworthy?

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,810
- Thomas?
 - Yes.

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,840
He is waiting for you in the room. Follow me.

44
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
It's this American named Thomas.

45
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,030
He's a ciphering specialist.

46
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,340
He worked with the CIA, too.

47
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,340
Nice to meet you. Please call me Steve.

48
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,370
Nice meeting you.

49
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,010
So,

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,470
how long will it take you to decipher the job?

51
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,610
It's very complex.

52
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,210
Probably over a month.

53
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,870
Okay.

54
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,110
You have this room to yourself.

55
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,170
You are to stay in here and not leave until you're finished.

56
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,060
My men will take shifts to keep an eye on you.

57
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,350
The pay is a million dollars for the job...

58
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,110
and an extra million if you succeed.

59
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,840
What do you say?

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,940
When do I start?

61
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,780
Don't take your eyes off from Thomas, not even for a second.

62
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,940
Soo Tak and I will take turns watching him overnight.

63
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,810
Okay.

64
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,620
Hey, is it all right to just leave the blueprint with that foreigner?

65
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,370
How will he decode it otherwise?

66
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,280
He could copy it.

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,410
He might even take a photo to send it to someone.

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Won't it be dangerous?

69
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,780
The music sheet...

70
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,100
has a special coating on it.

71
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,110
A special coating?

72
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,940
It won't show up even if you try to photocopy it or take pictures.

73
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,270
That's how Professor Na made it in the first place.

74
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,840
As long as we watch Thomas, there's no chance it'll leak.

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Don't worry.

76
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,580
I'm not worried.

77
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,870
The vice chairman is so smart. I'm sure he thought it out.

78
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,010
I'll go in now. Come and change shifts with me at night.

79
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,640
Okay, have fun.

80
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,070
Soo Yeon, it's me.

81
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,710
We have to meet right now. Where should I go?

82
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,520
What is that?

83
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,270
You can't photocopy it nor take a picture?

84
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,910
Your only chance is to run with it.

85
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,970
Who will do that for us?

86
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,610
Who do you think?

87
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,510
There's only one person who can do it.

88
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,170
Soo Tak?

89
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,470
No, it'll put him in danger.

90
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,010
I wish I could help,

91
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,510
but I'm looking after my mum. I have nephews to look after, too.

92
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,170
Then...

93
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,170
Can you somehow copy it by drawing it out?

94
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,680
It's like a piano score. It's very complicated.

95
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,940
If I get the components slightly wrong while copying it in a rush,

96
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,140
all our efforts will become useless.

97
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,980
Gosh. It's a pie in the sky.

98
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,170
It's right in front of us, but we have no way of getting it.

99
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,310
We'll find a way somehow.

100
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,340
It's time for my shift.

101
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,060
I should go.

102
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,540
- Okay.
 - Bye.

103
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,440
- I'll call you.
 - Okay.

104
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,150
What should we do? We don't have much time.

105
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,740
Gosh, I wish we could just memorise it by looking...

106
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,570
He can remember what he sees like a picture in his brain.

107
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,610
Photographic memory...

108
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,340
Jin Cheol, Jin Cheol. Stop sleeping and get up.

109
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,460
I'll buy you cookies.

110
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,370
Search online for any music sheet.

111
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,370
Okay.

112
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,240
Here. There you go.

113
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,240
I'll show you a music sheet. Take a look.

114
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,370
Take a look at it then draw it out. Okay?

115
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,770
I'm sleepy. I want to sleep.

116
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,440
Come on, help us out, you punk.

117
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,570
Get up, get up.

118
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,370
If you don't draw it, I won't let you sleep until you're 60.

119
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,610
This is it.

120
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,040
Jin Cheol can draw it.

121
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,440
We'll save Guk Cheol, okay?

122
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,380
Guk Cheol. I miss him.

123
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,040
The chairman's health is deteriorating. I'm worried.

124
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,310
He's having a hard time at work as well.

125
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,340
Take this and remind him to take it regularly at the office.

126
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,840
I will.

127
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,840
But do you know why his blood pressure suddenly got bad?

128
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,570
Ever since Gwang Woo got out,

129
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,970
he's been extremely stressed.

130
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,640
The chairman wants you to join us for the meal.

131
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,170
Yes, Ma'am.

132
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,310
One, two, three, four,

133
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,610
five, six, seven, eight.

134
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,840
How many of these will he have to take...

135
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,240
for his blood pressure to calm down?

136
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,040
Why is that punk... What is this?

137
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,970
It's awkward seeing him across the table, right?

138
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,140
I still have a hard time swallowing.

139
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,140
Father, I don't think this is right.

140
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,240
Why are we eating at the same table with him?

141
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,810
Tae Gwang.

142
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,880
Look into a place abroad for Gwang Woo to stay for a few years.

143
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,740
I don't care if it's Africa, the Middle East or Eastern Europe.

144
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,810
I prefer him to be as far as he can be.

145
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,940
Are you going back home?

146
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,870
You had four years left of your sentence, right?

147
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,740
Go live abroad...

148
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,570
for those four years.

149
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,470
Gun Woo, get out right now.

150
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,870
Get out of this house.

151
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,740
What do you think you're doing?

152
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,110
Dad. It's because of him, isn't it?

153
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,160
Are you kicking me out so that you can support him?

154
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,870
Gun Woo saved our company...

155
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,670
after you almost ruined it.

156
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,530
You don't deserve to say a thing.

157
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,240
How dare you raise your voice?

158
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,370
Are you taking his side in front of me?

159
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,570
Tae Gwang.

160
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,140
Kick him out of the country within this week.

161
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,440
Yes, Sir.

162
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,110
You can't kick him out!

163
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,540
He has the right to be a shareholder.

164
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,540
Gwang Woo, I'll find your place for you. Don't you worry.

165
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Hey.

166
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,010
You must think that the EGM has your back.

167
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,570
I can't go.

168
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,110
I won't.

169
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,810
Why do I have to be kicked out because of him?

170
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,050
You little...

171
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,220
Just tell me to go and kill myself instead.

172
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,080
I'll disappear from your sight.

173
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,610
You little...

174
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,210
- Sir!
 - Chairman!

175
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,240
- Chairman!
 - Chairman!

176
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,050
- Father!
 - Dad!

177
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,070
Call 911 right now! Hurry!

178
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,770
Dad!

179
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,110
Sir!

180
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,640
Chairman!

181
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,070
That's weird. This pill should do it.

182
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,870
What do you think about switching it to something else?

183
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,730
This is the best there is in Korea.

184
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,270
I think it'll depend on the type of person...

185
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,640
What do you know?

186
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,540
Doctor Hwang would know what's best for him.

187
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,370
Make sure he doesn't get any stress for a while.

188
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,710
I will.

189
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,910
This is all because of you.

190
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,810
Don't ever come back to this house.

191
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,910
I think Dad's in trouble.

192
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,110
How is Chairman doing?

193
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,240
He'll be fine soon.

194
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,720
Hey.

195
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,740
Stop pretending like you're concerned about him.

196
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,240
Of course.

197
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,810
Without Dad, he's nothing.

198
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,640
- I'll go back to work.
 - Okay, Sir.

199
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,810
Chief Secretary Moon.

200
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,140
Did you find anything about Gi Tan?

201
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,540
We're using all of our men to find something,

202
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,910
but we can't find anything.

203
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,040
I can only get rid of Gun Woo and the others...

204
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,340
if I get my hands on that blueprint.

205
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,340
Are you okay?

206
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,540
You've been sleeping.

207
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
I thought you were dead.

208
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,110
They will kill us.

209
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,910
They won't let us live.

210
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Darn it.

211
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,140
Why do I have to spend my final moments...

212
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,640
with you?

213
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,840
I thought I would die...

214
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,910
a bit more glamorously than this.

215
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,940
Come near.

216
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Can you do it?

217
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,640
We need to try.

218
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,970
We can't sit around to die here.

219
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,540
- Come nearer.
 - Okay.

220
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,710
What will you do with Gi Tan?

221
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,940
He passed through the needles, so we can't get him to speak.

222
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,840
You should just kill him.

223
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,140
What a strange man.

224
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,470
It's not just the way he endured pain.

225
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,470
But I can't forget about those piercing looks...

226
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,540
which he gave me.

227
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,340
Are you fond of him?

228
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,080
I know him very well.

229
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,910
- If you let him live, he'll...
 - Will you take...

230
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,870
the responsibility...

231
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,610
if he becomes trouble?

232
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,170
What will happen to my junior?

233
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,440
What do you want me to do?

234
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,970
I'll get in trouble...

235
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,910
if she returns safely.

236
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,710
You're asking me to kill her.

237
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,340
To be honest,

238
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,440
that'll be a relief for me.

239
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,340
Cha Woo.

240
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,080
Go and bring those two here.

241
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,240
I must decide...

242
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,010
whether to kill them or to let them live.

243
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Yes, Boss.

244
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,870
We're almost there. Just a little more.

245
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,240
Don't untie everything yet.

246
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,640
They'll be here soon.

247
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,840
(Give them some water.)

248
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,740
Water.

249
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,340
Give me some water.

250
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,440
How many of them are there?

251
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,610
From what I hear,

252
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,340
there are at least 10 of them.

253
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,540
We grew too tired.

254
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,110
We can't fight all of them.

255
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Whom are you calling?

256
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,040
Hello? Is this the police?

257
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,640
A group of Chinese is smuggling something.

258
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,270
You can track this phone to find their location.

259
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,810
How long will it take?

260
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,810
Okay, you should hurry.

261
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,470
Police officers will be here in about 10 minutes.

262
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,270
You're smart.

263
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,940
Are you ready?

264
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Yes.

265
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,910
(What's taking him so long?)

266
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,970
(Go and check.)

267
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,610
- Are you okay?
 - I think I broke my leg.

268
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,340
- They'll kill us.
 - I can't make it.

269
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,810
Go without me.

270
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,440
Shoot.

271
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,610
You lost them?

272
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,340
I'm sorry, Boss.

273
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,840
It must've been difficult to escape.

274
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
The police stepped in at the worst timing.

275
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,610
Gi Tan must have done something.

276
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,910
I told you, he's a professional.

277
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,610
He's the one who took down Michael Chang...

278
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,790
in Hainan.

279
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,970
Is that true?

280
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,240
Yes, Gi Tan destroyed...

281
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,640
Michael's foothold in Hainan.

282
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,430
What a man.

283
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,440
He's dangerous.

284
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,820
Do not let him live.

285
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,840
Chae Ryung.

286
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,870
Find Gi Tan yourself.

287
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
- Pardon?
 - You probably know...

288
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,740
where he'll go to.

289
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,010
You must bring him to me.

290
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,740
Yes, Boss.

291
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,440
Move your ankle.

292
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,640
Thankfully, it doesn't seem broken.

293
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,010
If you can walk on your own,

294
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,940
we should part ways here.

295
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,510
Why did you save me?

296
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,410
You could've gotten caught because of me.

297
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,140
I even tortured you.

298
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,040
So why did you...

299
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,470
You were only doing your job.

300
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,310
It was for the better of the country.

301
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,770
I have nothing against you.

302
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,440
Where will you go now?

303
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,140
I'm going to find the blueprint...

304
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,040
and prove my innocence.

305
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,140
- What about you?
 - I'll go see my direct supervisor.

306
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,940
Is he the one who organised this mission?

307
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,120
Yes.

308
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,270
He's the one who gives me all the orders.

309
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,710
Don't you find it weird?

310
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,910
He left you alone with the police.

311
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,810
Also, Jo Gi Ryang's gang was waiting outside the safe house.

312
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,840
He worked over 20 years with the NIS.

313
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,010
- I doubt...
 - I'd be suspicious if I were you.

314
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,040
There's no harm in being careful.

315
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,140
You should check on it first.

316
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,540
Gi Tan escaped from Gi Ryang's men?

317
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,210
They're not the type to make such a mistake.

318
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,600
He tends to be swift on his feet.

319
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,710
He's cornered right now.

320
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,610
If we act aggressively,

321
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,140
he'll have a tough time.

322
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,640
There's a limit to where he can go.

323
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,140
We'll be able to catch him if we stake out in those spots.

324
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,610
Goodness.

325
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,840
- Yes.
 - It's Yoo Sung Ae.

326
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,120
What happened?

327
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,630
I was held captive by the Chinese organisation. I barely got out.

328
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,510
Where is Gi Tan? Is he with you?

329
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,940
Yes, he's with me.

330
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,310
Where are you right now? I'll come to you.

331
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,040
I'll be there within an hour.

332
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,270
Don't go anywhere.

333
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,260
What is it about Gi Tan?

334
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,510
They're at a reconstruction site in Jungnam-gu.

335
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,910
Is that so?

336
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,640
Hurry and inform Jo Gi Ryang's gang.

337
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,710
No.

338
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,040
Il Jae, you should go there yourself...

339
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,570
- and finish off the job.
 - Dad!

340
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,640
He already escaped from Gi Ryang.

341
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,840
We can only rest easy if we witness his end.

342
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,110
I understand.

343
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,040
Get me some trustworthy men.

344
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,740
I have to get rid of my subordinate as well.

345
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,270
I'll gather my men instead.

346
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,210
That's a good idea.

347
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,210
You should keep an eye on Soo Yeon instead.

348
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,840
Yes, Sir.

349
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,640
I'll be back, Sir.

350
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,340
All right.

351
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,540
Dad.

352
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,490
There's no need to get blood on our hands.

353
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,640
He's responsible for ruining my 30-year-long political career.

354
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,570
Getting blood on my hands is not a big deal any more.

355
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,510
How dare he?

356
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,710
It's already been over an hour since we were supposed to meet.

357
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,910
She promised to meet me here.

358
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,040
Hey, Mr Yeom!

359
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,680
Be quiet, will you?

360
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,740
What?

361
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,270
Hey.

362
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,740
Look everywhere in this area.

363
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
- Yes, Sir.
 - Yes, Sir.

364
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,110
Your work process is pathetic.

365
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,770
What did you say?

366
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,040
How will you serve my father-in-law like this?

367
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,310
What about you? Weren't you the one who ruined him like that?

368
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,370
What?

369
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,610
Let's stop it here. Okay?

370
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,910
You...

371
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,370
That...

372
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,140
You were caught in Il Jae's trap.

373
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,140
How can this be?

374
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,770
Ever since I joined the NIS,

375
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,140
I worked under Mr Yeom.

376
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,140
His orders...

377
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,140
were orders from the state for me.

378
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,910
I'm a fool...

379
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,440
I'm so foolish.

380
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,540
What have I been doing with my life?

381
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,540
I know how it feels...

382
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,710
to be betrayed by someone you used to trust.

383
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Byun Il Jae...

384
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
was my uncle.

385
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,770
I used to follow him around so much when I was young.

386
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,210
But he killed my parents and my aunt.

387
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,840
What's important is now.

388
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,610
The things that happen after you find out the truth.

389
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,510
What are you going to do?

390
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,310
A secret agent like me...

391
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,040
can only receive orders from one person.

392
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,270
I don't know anyone at headquarters.

393
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,670
So it won't be easy.

394
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,840
Meet me here in two days.

395
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,510
(Oh Jin Cheol)

396
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
Yes, Sir.

397
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,940
She's currently in her brother's room.

398
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,770
No. Gi Tan is nowhere to be seen.

399
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,440
He'll definitely show up.

400
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,020
Keep an eye out.

401
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,040
I will.

402
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,670
Okay, Soo Tak. Good luck.

403
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,810
What did he say?

404
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,840
We'll meet him at the hotel tomorrow at dawn.

405
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,370
Tomorrow at dawn?

406
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,140
Shouldn't we let Jin Cheol sleep in advance?

407
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,910
Go to sleep.

408
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,640
- Okay.
 - Let's sleep.

409
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,110
Good boy.

410
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,410
There. Let's go to bed.

411
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,900
Good boy.

412
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,610
I hope he'll be able to help.

413
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,640
What is it this time? Gosh.

414
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,840
I don't need any loans.

415
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,270
It's me, Gi Tan.

416
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,710
Gi Tan! Where are you?

417
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,370
Is Soo Yeon doing all right?

418
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Of course.

419
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,210
Gi Tan, it's me.

420
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,040
Where are you? Let's meet. I'll come to you.

421
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,310
Not yet.

422
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,270
I'll call you back later.

423
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,670
Don't hang up.

424
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,840
If you hang up right now, I won't ever see you again.

425
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,640
How are you? Are you hurt?

426
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,040
Where are you sleeping?

427
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,440
Let me talk to Lawyer Min.

428
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,910
Me?

429
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,940
Yes, Gi Tan. Go ahead.

430
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,940
I'm sure Soo Yeon is being watched by Il Jae.

431
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,910
You have to be careful.

432
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,940
All right. Where should I meet you?

433
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,770
Okay. Okay, don't worry.

434
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,570
What did he say?

435
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,010
He'll come see you now.

436
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,440
Let's go.

437
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,020
My car is parked on the first spot in the parking lot.

438
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,840
I'll take care of the guy following you.

439
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,710
Go and see him.

440
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,240
Gosh, that's hot!

441
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,510
You should look where you're going.

442
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,740
You can't go. You hurt my hand.

443
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,030
Hit-and-run isn't just a thing for cars.

444
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,370
Pay for my treatment.

445
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,110
Get out of my way.

446
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,310
Call the cops!

447
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,810
He just hit me!

448
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,710
Help me! Help me! Please help.

449
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,680
Get him!

450
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,810
My hand! It's burning!

451
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,310
- Come along.
 - No!

452
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,040
Soo Yeon.

453
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,670
You look terrible.

454
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,940
It's just my face that's a mess.

455
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,310
I missed you a lot.

456
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,510
This is from Mr Min.

457
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,940
Use this to call me.

458
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,240
We'll have the blueprint very soon.

459
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,430
Do you know how dangerous this is?

460
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,340
I won't let you go down like this.

461
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,980
This time,

462
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,640
I will protect you.

463
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,010
I'll send you the blueprint once we get it.

464
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,740
Spend this.

465
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,810
I have to go.

466
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,740
Look after yourself.

467
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,770
Jeong Eun.

468
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,010
Cha Jeong Eun.

469
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,710
I'm Guk Cheol.

470
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,070
I'm Guk Cheol, Jeong Eun.

471
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,370
Why are you telling me now?

472
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,540
I missed you so much.

473
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,210
You silly.

474
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,740
- Did she get away?
 - I apologise.

475
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,210
She knew I was onto her.

476
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,670
Pull back for now.

477
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,480
Yes, Sir.

478
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,270
I don't like how things are going.

479
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,040
When do you think the expert...

480
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
will decode the blueprint?

481
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,810
He needs at least a month.

482
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,140
That is what...

483
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,240
Gi Tan is after.

484
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,770
Gun Woo is a smart man.

485
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,040
You won't have to worry about that.

486
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,410
He keeps slipping out of our grasp.

487
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,670
I don't like that.

488
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,110
Soo Yeon.

489
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,140
Have you heard from Soo Tak?

490
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,310
He just sent a text telling us to wait.

491
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,340
I'm going to have a shower and then take a nap.

492
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,140
Could you please wake me up after three hours?

493
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,370
Oh, sure.

494
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,940
It's me. Come up.

495
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,240
- Concentrate.
 - It hurts.

496
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,980
There's no time.

497
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,440
Look carefully and remember it.

498
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,710
Don't yawn. Look at it carefully.

499
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,240
I'm done.

500
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,540
Put it back.

501
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,670
Was that it?

502
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,070
He took his time because he's tired.

503
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Thank you, Soo Tak.

504
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,010
I really hope it helps clear Gi Tan's name.

505
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,410
It will. Go back inside.

506
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,870
Well done.

507
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,870
That's Soo Yeon.

508
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,710
What is she doing here?

509
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,910
What are you doing here, Sir?

510
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,370
Did you just see Soo Yeon?

511
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,570
Soo Yeon? No.

512
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,610
Why are you here?

513
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,610
He was passing by and dropped in.

514
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,140
How far has he gotten?

515
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,040
I don't know much, but I think he's halfway there.

516
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,780
Excuse me.

517
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,010
Where's the patient gone?

518
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,440
He left last night and hasn't come back yet.

519
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,310
I'm hungry.

520
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,940
I'll buy you some tasty jajangmyeon when you're done.

521
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,980
I'm finished.

522
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,480
He's a genius.

523
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,770
- Give me jajangmyeon.
 - I ordered it. It'll be here soon.

524
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,110
Take a photo and send it to Gi Tan.

525
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,140
Okay.

526
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,510
I just got it.

527
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,910
The music sheet is the blueprint.

528
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,310
Okay.

529
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,310
Thanks, Soo Yeon. When it's all over,

530
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,210
I'll come and get you.

531
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,070
Look after yourself.

532
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,640
Don't worry.

533
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,940
- Soo Yeon.
 - Yes, Gi Tan.

534
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,070
When this is over...

535
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,310
Yes?

536
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,810
You, Dong Soo and I...

537
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,640
The three of us should move abroad.

538
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,510
Let's go to a place where no one knows of us...

539
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,980
and live happily.

540
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,140
Then were you going to leave alone?

541
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,640
I won't let you disappear again.

542
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,810
Dong Soo and I...

543
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,870
will follow you to the end.

544
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,240
I'll call you.

545
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
Be careful.

546
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,140
I'm here. Where are you?

547
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,410
Are you alone?

548
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,210
Don't you trust me?

549
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,210
Walk towards me.

550
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,570
Do you have the blueprint?

551
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,910
- Yes.
 - Where is it?

552
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,410
Send it to me.

553
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,370
- When our boss sees it...
 - Don't bother.

554
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,140
Tell your boss this.

555
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,340
If he wants the blueprint,

556
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:51,910
he should clear my name.

557
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,840
Gi Tan.

558
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,770
Your group has that much influence.

559
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,210
But before that,

560
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,540
send me to the States.

561
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,240
Gi Tan.

562
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,010
How about this?

563
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,440
We can take the blueprint and leave Korea together.

564
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:12,770
We can...

565
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,740
apply for a patent in America.

566
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,670
We just have to give the licence for China to Huaping.

567
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,410
I give you my word.

568
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,010
I'll leave with Jeong Eun.

569
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,410
Let's do the rest as you say.

570
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,310
If he gets us to America,

571
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,470
we'll give him China's licence.

572
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,110
I'll wait for an answer.

573
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,540
You'll leave me...

574
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:48,040
to go back to Jeong Eun, will you?

575
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,140
Did you ask for me?

576
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,240
Oh Soo Yeon.

577
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,370
- Find her.
 - Pardon?

578
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,950
I heard that she and Gun Woo can't live without each other.

579
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,010
There were such rumours, but...

580
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,240
The two ruined my life.

581
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,910
I will make them pay.

582
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,240
If I don't, it'll kill me.

583
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:35,270
I have something very nice you can use against her.

584
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,490
What's that?

585
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,240
She took out a loan.

586
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,770
Quite a bit of loan, in fact.

587
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:53,870
So what?

588
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,340
Yes?

589
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,670
I wired this month's interest.

590
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,770
You're mean, even for a loan shark.

591
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,470
Yes.

592
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,140
Okay. I'll be there.

593
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:38,600
Dong Soo, I have to go. Don't go anywhere, okay?

594
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,610
Okay.

595
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,370
(Joongwon Capital)

596
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,240
Oh, wow, look at you.

597
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,710
You've gotten prettier since we last met.

598
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,570
Don't be so scared.

599
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,340
I don't bite.

600
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,210
What are you doing?

601
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,970
Don't you regret it?

602
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:49,940
"Why on earth did I say that in court?"

603
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,410
No.

604
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,610
Aren't you afraid of me?

605
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,540
Hit me. What else can you do?

606
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,610
Hey, hey. I would never hit a woman.

607
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,640
I hate that kind of thing.

608
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,270
Then what will you do?

609
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,140
You owe a lot of money.

610
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,140
So what?

611
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:19,210
I bought you.

612
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,970
You even signed away your organs.

613
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,250
Were you in need?

614
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,470
That's one contract you should never sign.

615
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,910
I pay the interest every month.

616
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,510
You should have paid back the principal long ago.

617
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,000
So what?

618
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,590
Do as I say.

619
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,140
Or serve time like I did.

620
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:51,940
Hey.

621
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,640
How did you find me here?

622
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,340
I told you to leave her alone.

623
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,470
Get him.

624
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,110
My secretary's outside.

625
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,770
If I don't show up, he'll call the police.

626
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,140
Let's go.

627
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,640
That little punk...

628
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,810
I told you to stay away.

629
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,370
I don't want to be involved with you.

630
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,140
Then stop getting into trouble!

631
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,810
- What?
 - If you're okay,

632
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,310
then I'll stop caring.

633
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,470
You must think I'm struggling.

634
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,400
But I'd be just fine without you people.

635
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,510
So please...

636
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,640
get out of my life.

637
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,540
Did he just get turned down?

638
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,670
I believe so.

639
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,470
Oh Soo Yeon...

640
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,540
She's so charming.

641
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,140
It's like...

642
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:24,970
Anyway,

643
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:26,970
she's not like...

644
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,870
other girls.

645
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,710
What are you doing?

646
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
Are you studying?

647
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,810
You can stop drawing that. It's over now.

648
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:52,440
You don't have to draw this any more, so stop it.

649
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,410
Okay. Go on, then.

650
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,740
Keep drawing it if you want to.

651
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,010
Once he starts, he never stops.

652
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,770
Where's your sister?

653
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,970
I don't know. She's angry. She left.

654
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,010
Why isn't she answering her phone?

655
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,840
I'll be right back.

656
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,340
Bye.

657
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,940
He wasn't here last night?

658
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,140
The nurse said he returned in the morning.

659
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,270
I think you need help monitoring them.

660
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,010
Find a nurse or member of staff who will help you.

661
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:04,670
Yes, Sir.

662
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,440
- It's a plane.
 - That's Soo Yeon's brother.

663
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,970
Sir, this is...

664
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:30,970
I'm sure of it.

665
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,010
It's the blueprint.

666
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,910
It's my plane.

667
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,770
You did a great job drawing this.

668
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,070
Did you do it?

669
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,340
I drew it. Dong Soo... No.

670
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:50,710
Oh Jin Cheol did it.

671
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:54,240
Yes, Jin Cheol. Where did you see this?

672
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,910
My sister showed it to me.

673
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,370
Did you really draw this?

674
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,190
I'm a genius.

675
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,470
Photographic memory. Genius.

676
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,340
"Photographic memory"?

677
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:13,770
Give me that. It's mine.

678
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,870
Right. Of course.

679
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,140
Jin Cheol, it's time for your drip.

680
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,770
Bye.

681
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:33,940
The blueprint...

682
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,410
is inside his head.

683
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,240
Yes, Sir.

684
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,240
Do you still have...

685
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,940
the syringe I gave you?

686
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,470
Yes.

687
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,610
Thank you.

688
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,410
You're such a good boy, Jin Cheol.

689
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,970
You don't mind injections.

690
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,670
When will Soo Yeon come back?

691
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,240
Very soon.

692
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,570
I should go.

693
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,970
Okay.

694
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:19,710
Bye.

695
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,410
What are you doing?

696
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,740
Dong Soo.

697
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:28,120
Isn't that your name?

698
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,740
Yes. No. My name is Oh Jin Cheol.

699
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:33,340
Is it?

700
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,510
You will feel very sleepy.

701
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,610
Have a good, long rest, Jin Cheol.

702
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,240
I brought tempura. It'll go all cold.

703
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,540
You're fast asleep.

704
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,510
Hello?

705
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,140
Soo Yeon.

706
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,810
Gi Tan.

707
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,710
Dong Soo! Dong Soo, what's wrong?

708
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,970
What is it? Dong Soo!

709
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,210
Help!

710
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,310
Wake up!

711
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:16,140
Dong Soo! What's wrong?

712
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,070
Help!

713
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,510
Dong Soo! Dong Soo!

714
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:26,370
Dong Soo! Is anyone there?

715
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,740
Dong Soo!

716
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,410
- Soo Yeon. What's wrong?
 - Help!

717
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,010
What's going on?

718
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,370
Something happened to Soo Yeon.

719
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:37,840
I have to go.

720
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,010
To do what?

721
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,240
Dong Soo. No, you have to wake up.

722
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,870
Dong Soo...

723
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,040
Dong Soo. Dong Soo.

724
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,570
Dong Soo...

725
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,140
What happened?

726
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,570
Why is he...

727
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,770
like this?

728
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,770
Why is he in this bed?

729
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,210
My brother's dead.

730
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,140
Poor Dong Soo.

731
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:41,970
Dong Soo...

732
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,870
Dong Soo is dead.

733
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,670
Don't.

734
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,110
Let go.

735
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,710
Il Jae's here.
