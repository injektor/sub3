1
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,650
<font color="yellow">Were Soo Yeon and I this close?</font>

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,240
<font color="yellow">I'm marrying Soo Yeon.</font>

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,080
<font color="yellow">Let me ask one thing. What's the relationship between...</font>

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,110
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh and me?</font>

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,830
<font color="yellow">If you can eliminate Gi Tan,</font>

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,680
<font color="yellow">I'm willing to team up with you again.</font>

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,310
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,950
<font color="yellow">You are not my son.</font>

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,580
<font color="yellow">How long will you hide that he has dementia?</font>

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,670
<font color="yellow">We're currently editing his will.</font>

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,080
<font color="yellow">After we're done, I'll send him off to a care centre.</font>

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,170
<font color="yellow">I found evidence of Il Jae's corruption.</font>

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,180
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,120
<font color="yellow">This must be Il Jae's doing.</font>

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,280
<font color="yellow">I'll report to the police.</font>

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,290
<font color="yellow">His necklace and mine are the same.</font>

17
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,270
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, where are you?</font>

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,760
<font color="yellow">Have you regained your memory?</font>

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,010
<font color="yellow">But you're a month too late.</font>

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,940
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon is completely mine.</font>

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,930
<font color="yellow">That's what happened.</font>

22
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,280
<font color="yellow">Give up on Soo Yeon.</font>

23
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,350
<font color="yellow">I won this.</font>

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,050
<font color="yellow">Did I ever...</font>

25
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,280
<font color="yellow">make your heart flutter?</font>

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,310
<font color="yellow">Did I ever...</font>

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,510
<font color="yellow">make your heart pound?</font>

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,740
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look like you feel the same way.</font>

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,680
<font color="yellow">- Gun Woo.
-  Don't say anything, Soo Yeon.</font>

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,850
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear anything...</font>

31
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,550
<font color="yellow">unless you're saying, "I love you."</font>

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,050
<font color="yellow">You can take your time.</font>

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,850
<font color="yellow">Take as much time as you need.</font>

34
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,550
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

35
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,410
<font color="yellow">Chairman.</font>

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,110
<font color="yellow">Chairman, what's wrong?</font>

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,750
<font color="yellow">Who knows everything about Soo Yeon and my history?</font>

38
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,190
<font color="yellow">I believe Chae Ryung knows everything.</font>

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,460
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,180
<font color="yellow">I heard she's in China but...</font>

41
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,580
<font color="yellow">Get my plane ready.</font>

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,650
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  I need to find out...</font>

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,880
<font color="yellow">the history between...</font>

44
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,180
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon and me.</font>

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,880
<font color="yellow">What about the CCTVs around the area?</font>

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,350
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it, Vice Chairman.</font>

47
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,280
<font color="yellow">Before we stabbed you,</font>

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,470
<font color="yellow">our boys sprayed all over the CCTVs around the area.</font>

49
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,780
<font color="yellow">Make sure you destroy the car you used.</font>

50
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,850
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

51
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,180
<font color="yellow">It's already been scraped and torn down piece by piece.</font>

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,470
<font color="yellow">May we report this to the police now?</font>

53
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,190
<font color="yellow">Of course, you may.</font>

54
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,010
<font color="yellow">There is no evidence...</font>

55
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,980
<font color="yellow">and people involved have already went overseas.</font>

56
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,310
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling okay?</font>

57
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,030
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm okay.</font>

58
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,950
<font color="yellow">I didn't know he'd go this far.</font>

59
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,410
<font color="yellow">There are things you can reach out to take...</font>

60
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,450
<font color="yellow">and things you need to risk your life to get.</font>

61
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,680
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you had to risk...</font>

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,210
<font color="yellow">Report my attack to the police...</font>

63
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,730
<font color="yellow">and let the reporters know, too.</font>

64
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,180
<font color="yellow">You should say there was a fight in Dodo Group to become the successor.</font>

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,070
<font color="yellow">Weren't you going to put this on Il Jae?</font>

66
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,180
<font color="yellow">There is nothing like Il Jae to destroy Gi Tan.</font>

67
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,450
<font color="yellow">I have to protect him a little.</font>

68
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,910
<font color="yellow">It's been reported that Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo...</font>

69
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,250
<font color="yellow">of Dodo Group was attacked by unidentified attackers.</font>

70
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,580
<font color="yellow">He's currently receiving treatment in a hospital downtown,</font>

71
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,910
<font color="yellow">and thankfully, his life is not in danger.</font>

72
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,090
<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo has been recognised...</font>

73
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,680
<font color="yellow">for his management skills, and he became the successor...</font>

74
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,050
<font color="yellow">of Dodo Group in place of ex-CEO Do Gwang Woo.</font>

75
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,250
<font color="yellow">What kind of news is that?</font>

76
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,450
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo never became the successor.</font>

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,510
<font color="yellow">He's very persistent.</font>

78
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,880
<font color="yellow">I should've just killed him.</font>

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,860
<font color="yellow">The police are...</font>

80
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,580
<font color="yellow">focused on this fight between...</font>

81
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,360
<font color="yellow">the two princes to become the successor of Dodo Group...</font>

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,510
<font color="yellow">and are searching for signs of personal grudges in this incident.</font>

83
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,250
<font color="yellow">I think Gun Woo set this up himself.</font>

84
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,750
<font color="yellow">He's letting people know that he's the successor.</font>

85
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,580
<font color="yellow">He's completely fooled Soo Yeon, too.</font>

86
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,650
<font color="yellow">She needs to know who he really is...</font>

87
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,750
<font color="yellow">before it's too late.</font>

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,660
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

89
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,380
<font color="yellow">You should just give him pressure with business...</font>

90
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,650
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is dirty and evil to the point that he'll take...</font>

91
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,080
<font color="yellow">a knife to his stomach.</font>

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,750
<font color="yellow">He'll side with Il Jae...</font>

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,650
<font color="yellow">to do away with me.</font>

94
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,210
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon is the only one who'll suffer in the midst of this.</font>

95
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,350
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

96
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,820
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

97
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,110
<font color="yellow">You must head to the airport.</font>

98
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,750
<font color="yellow">Did you give Chae Ryung a call?</font>

99
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,350
<font color="yellow">She'll be waiting for you in China.</font>

100
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,950
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Sir.</font>

101
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,710
<font color="yellow">- Gun Woo.
-  Yes. Welcome, Soo Yeon.</font>

102
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,650
<font color="yellow">This is the prosecutor who's in charge of this retrial.</font>

103
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,180
<font color="yellow">My name is Choi Jeong Gook.</font>

104
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,080
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.</font>

105
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

106
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,750
<font color="yellow">It's me, Gun Woo.</font>

107
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,050
<font color="yellow">Can we talk?</font>

108
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,310
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

109
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,550
<font color="yellow">Are you listening to me?</font>

110
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,550
<font color="yellow">So you're the prosecutor for Il Jae's retrial, right?</font>

111
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,850
<font color="yellow">I have a guest over.</font>

112
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,980
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to you later.</font>

113
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,180
<font color="yellow">I heard you lost evidence of Il Jae's corruption in this attack.</font>

114
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,610
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was about to hand it over to Lawyer Oh.</font>

115
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,280
<font color="yellow">You didn't mention this to the police.</font>

116
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,750
<font color="yellow">They probably destroyed the evidence already.</font>

117
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,840
<font color="yellow">If I mentioned it, I could be filed for making false accusations.</font>

118
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,850
<font color="yellow">Do you also believe that this is his doing?</font>

119
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,770
<font color="yellow">They took the evidence. Isn't it obvious?</font>

120
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,050
<font color="yellow">The media has been saying that it's a fight between successors.</font>

121
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did that on purpose.</font>

122
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,120
<font color="yellow">I needed to catch Il Jae off-guard...</font>

123
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,740
<font color="yellow">before the retrial.</font>

124
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,920
<font color="yellow">Do you not have a copy of the evidence?</font>

125
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,210
<font color="yellow">Yes. Had I known this would've happened,</font>

126
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,480
<font color="yellow">I would've made a copy.</font>

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,040
<font color="yellow">Will it be difficult for Il Jae to receive additional sentence...</font>

128
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,810
<font color="yellow">during this retrial?</font>

129
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,780
<font color="yellow">We'll try even if it doesn't happen.</font>

130
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,010
<font color="yellow">I have to return to the office.</font>

131
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,010
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

132
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,450
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

133
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,150
<font color="yellow">I had my doubts.</font>

134
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,980
<font color="yellow">Did you stage this yourself? You're amazing, Gun Woo.</font>

135
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,810
<font color="yellow">You catch onto things quickly.</font>

136
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,380
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo wouldn't stage an attack...</font>

137
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,510
<font color="yellow">to get that evidence.</font>

138
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,560
<font color="yellow">What happened to the evidence?</font>

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,480
<font color="yellow">I destroyed it. It went up in flames.</font>

140
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,050
<font color="yellow">Destroyed?</font>

141
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,940
<font color="yellow">Yes, as you've heard,</font>

142
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,050
<font color="yellow">your other crimes won't be proved during the retrial.</font>

143
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
<font color="yellow">Do you want me...</font>

144
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,870
<font color="yellow">to get rid of Gi Tan?</font>

145
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,880
<font color="yellow">Yes. Life is about giving and taking.</font>

146
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,380
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan is the one...</font>

147
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,080
<font color="yellow">who told me that this attack was staged by you.</font>

148
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,050
<font color="yellow">He already knew.</font>

149
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,380
<font color="yellow">You should get ready.</font>

150
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,050
<font color="yellow">I don't care. There is no evidence left.</font>

151
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,370
<font color="yellow">Come and visit me before the retrial.</font>

152
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,710
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to you.</font>

153
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,680
<font color="yellow">I'm hanging up.</font>

154
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,180
<font color="yellow">Who was that?</font>

155
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,550
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

<font color="yellow">Once I get out,</font>

<font color="yellow">What do you mean...</font>

165
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,280
<font color="yellow">you'll take care of him?</font>

166
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,650
<font color="yellow">I'm going to destroy him.</font>

<font color="yellow">Darn you!</font>

170
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,480
<font color="yellow">You're pathetic.</font>

171
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,210
<font color="yellow">What if you're found out?</font>

172
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,980
<font color="yellow">It'll be more than just ruining my presidential campaign.</font>

173
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,150
<font color="yellow">You'd be putting a knife on my throat.</font>

174
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,350
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do then?</font>

215

<font color="yellow">You lost your mayor position as well as B World.</font>

216
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,880
<font color="yellow">If you lose her as well,</font>

217
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,380
<font color="yellow">it'll be hard for you to make a comeback.</font>

220
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,750
<font color="yellow">But if it breaks from the inside out, it'll become a chick.</font>

221
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,080
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

222
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,110
<font color="yellow">having a battle against the wall of reality.</font>

223
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,880
<font color="yellow">If I manage to break out of it,</font>

224
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,550
<font color="yellow">I'll become a rooster that will...</font>

225
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,750
<font color="yellow">open up the morning.</font>

226
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,080
<font color="yellow">I have no doubts.</font>

227
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,750
<font color="yellow">Just watch. When I get out of here,</font>

228
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,650
<font color="yellow">you'll see how I transform.</font>

229
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,080
<font color="yellow">The ones that put me in this situation...</font>

230
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,610
<font color="yellow">and the people who looked down at me with contempt...</font>

231
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,480
<font color="yellow">will all be put in prison by me.</font>

232
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,380
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

233
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,680
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

234
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,880
<font color="yellow">How is the boss?</font>

235
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,250
<font color="yellow">He's inside.</font>

236
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,980
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin, please wait here for a moment.</font>

237
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,250
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

238
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,880
<font color="yellow">You can speak casually with me. It's fine.</font>

239
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,750
<font color="yellow">I heard from Mr Moon already.</font>

240
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,310
<font color="yellow">Tell me everything you know about Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

241
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,080
<font color="yellow">All of my memories that I've lost...</font>

242
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,480
<font color="yellow">You must know everything since you were always by my side.</font>

243
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,550
<font color="yellow">Why do you suddenly want to know?</font>

244
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,350
<font color="yellow">Whenever I think of her,</font>

245
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,110
<font color="yellow">my heart aches.</font>

246
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,080
<font color="yellow">I don't know what it is,</font>

247
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,250
<font color="yellow">but it makes me sad and I long for her.</font>

248
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,080
<font color="yellow">My heart hurts so much that it drives me crazy.</font>

249
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,350
<font color="yellow">Who is Oh Soo Yeon? Who was she to me?</font>

250
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,450
<font color="yellow">Did Soo Yeon give you that necklace?</font>

251
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,320
<font color="yellow">This?</font>

252
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,010
<font color="yellow">That's Soo Yeon's necklace.</font>

253
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,580
<font color="yellow">You gave it to her as a present when you were young.</font>

254
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,310
<font color="yellow">I picked it out for you because you asked for my help.</font>

255
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,480
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

256
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,880
<font color="yellow">knew me since I was young?</font>

257
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,580
<font color="yellow">Her name used to be Jeong Eun.</font>

258
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,280
<font color="yellow">Cha Jeong Eun.</font>

259
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
<font color="yellow">Cha Jeong Eun.</font>

260
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,150
<font color="yellow">Where is the needle?</font>

261
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,080
<font color="yellow">When you were infected by the MK2 virus,</font>

262
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,880
<font color="yellow">she's the one who saved you.</font>

263
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,910
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

264
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,280
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

265
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,880
<font color="yellow">saved my life?</font>

266
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,480
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

267
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,110
<font color="yellow">He died because of your father! Bring back my husband!</font>

268
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,080
<font color="yellow">She went through a lot of trouble after that.</font>

269
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,350
<font color="yellow">That's when she changed her name to Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

270
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,250
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Oh Soo Yeon?</font>

271
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,810
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

272
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,280
<font color="yellow">When you were falsely accused of homicide,</font>

273
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,860
<font color="yellow">she worked really hard to prove your innocence.</font>

274
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,580
<font color="yellow">I trust you. Something must have gone wrong.</font>

275
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,680
<font color="yellow">I finished drawing.</font>

276
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,310
<font color="yellow">In the end,</font>

277
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,680
<font color="yellow">she lost her little brother.</font>

278
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,180
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

279
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,880
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo! What's wrong, Dong Soo? Open your eyes!</font>

280
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,410
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo...</font>

281
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,380
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo. Dong Soo...</font>

282
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,080
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo...</font>

283
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,910
<font color="yellow">I remember that much.</font>

284
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,980
<font color="yellow">But what happened after that?</font>

285
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,410
<font color="yellow">Did I...</font>

286
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,780
<font color="yellow">love Soo Yeon?</font>

287
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,580
<font color="yellow">You two...</font>

288
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,410
<font color="yellow">loved each other dearly.</font>

289
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,780
<font color="yellow">Did Soo Yeon...</font>

290
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,250
<font color="yellow">love me, too?</font>

291
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,880
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

292
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,550
<font color="yellow">To the point where I was jealous.</font>

293
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,510
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

294
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,950
<font color="yellow">thought you were dead.</font>

295
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,480
<font color="yellow">That's why she partnered with Gun Woo to take revenge.</font>

296
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,650
<font color="yellow">Are you going to be all right?</font>

297
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,510
<font color="yellow">The hypnosis won't come undone that easily.</font>

298
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,380
<font color="yellow">If he finds out about his past with Soo Yeon,</font>

299
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,080
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he'll try to have the same relationship again.</font>

300
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,680
<font color="yellow">I think it's best to stop that from happening.</font>

301
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,180
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that the pain will come back?</font>

302
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,680
<font color="yellow">It's hard to predict.</font>

303
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,450
<font color="yellow">That's why you should stop him.</font>

304
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,480
<font color="yellow">If he starts to get the pain again,</font>

305
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,450
<font color="yellow">hypnosis might not work this time.</font>

306
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,850
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is out of the hospital.</font>

307
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,550
<font color="yellow">I have to meet Soo Yeon right now.</font>

308
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,280
<font color="yellow">I think we should started with the other...</font>

309
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear me?</font>

310
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,280
<font color="yellow">I need to meet her.</font>

311
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,910
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

312
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,210
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon and I were in love.</font>

313
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,310
<font color="yellow">How can I forget about that like a fool?</font>

314
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,080
<font color="yellow">So what can you do?</font>

315
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,980
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

316
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,520
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo saved Soo Yeon's life when she sank under water.</font>

317
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,480
<font color="yellow">He even got stabbed in front of her.</font>

318
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,180
<font color="yellow">That's why I need to get her from...</font>

319
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,180
<font color="yellow">What if she won't come back?</font>

320
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,880
<font color="yellow">You're a man of her past, and he's her man at the moment.</font>

321
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,300
<font color="yellow">How will you deal with the disappointment...</font>

322
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,010
<font color="yellow">if she won't come back to you?</font>

323
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,450
<font color="yellow">If you want Soo Yeon back, you have to ruin Gun Woo first.</font>

324
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,680
<font color="yellow">She isn't your priority.</font>

325
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,680
<font color="yellow">Why did you come back to Korea?</font>

326
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,910
<font color="yellow">Weren't you going to get your revenge...</font>

327
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,680
<font color="yellow">on Il Jae and Gwang Woo, and take over Dodo Group?</font>

328
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,910
<font color="yellow">We just managed to fix our gunpoint on the target.</font>

329
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,150
<font color="yellow">If you want to live in the past,</font>

330
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,180
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

331
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,580
<font color="yellow">leave your side.</font>

332
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,910
<font color="yellow">They are animals.</font>

333
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,450
<font color="yellow">How blinded are they to stab you?</font>

334
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,850
<font color="yellow">I'm okay, but I'm worried about you.</font>

335
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,850
<font color="yellow">I doubt...</font>

336
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,580
<font color="yellow">that they will assault me.</font>

337
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,180
<font color="yellow">We never know.</font>

338
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,550
<font color="yellow">Why don't we give the video about your medicine over to the police?</font>

339
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,550
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

340
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
<font color="yellow">It's better...</font>

341
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,810
<font color="yellow">to take care of family business within the family.</font>

342
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,680
<font color="yellow">I feel nervous, Father.</font>

343
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,070
<font color="yellow">I need to at least...</font>

344
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,550
<font color="yellow">file for a restraining order so that they can't get near you.</font>

345
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,980
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

346
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,550
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

347
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,210
<font color="yellow">What happened with my inheritance?</font>

348
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,180
<font color="yellow">As you said,</font>

349
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,170
<font color="yellow">I arranged 60 percent for Vice Chairman Do...</font>

350
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,980
<font color="yellow">and 40 percent for CEO Do Shin Young.</font>

351
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,680
<font color="yellow">We'll rearrange that.</font>

352
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,980
<font color="yellow">It'll be 80 percent for Gun Woo...</font>

353
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,750
<font color="yellow">and 20 percent for Shin Young.</font>

354
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,280
<font color="yellow">Father, I'm grateful but...</font>

355
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,380
<font color="yellow">Come to think about it,</font>

356
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,480
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed in Shin Young, too.</font>

357
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,550
<font color="yellow">Just do as I say.</font>

358
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

359
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,100
<font color="yellow">When will you be finished with Father's will?</font>

360
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,190
<font color="yellow">He has to file a lawsuit to retrieve what he gave...</font>

361
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,580
<font color="yellow">to Ms Hwang and Gwang Woo.</font>

362
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,620
<font color="yellow">It'll take a while for his will to be finished.</font>

363
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,580
<font color="yellow">I want this to be settled as soon as possible.</font>

364
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,080
<font color="yellow">Only then will Gwang Woo give up on trying anything.</font>

365
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,310
<font color="yellow">I'll find a way.</font>

366
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,280
<font color="yellow">Is Chairman still doing bad?</font>

367
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,010
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

368
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,480
<font color="yellow">Oh, I heard he doesn't have dementia,</font>

369
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,750
<font color="yellow">so don't worry, Soo Yeon.</font>

370
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,110
<font color="yellow">I think his side effects are taking too long to wear out.</font>

371
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,890
<font color="yellow">Dinner was too salty!</font>

372
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,560
<font color="yellow">You haven't had dinner yet, Chairman.</font>

373
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,990
<font color="yellow">Tell my wife to come.</font>

374
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,100
<font color="yellow">Chairman.</font>

375
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,010
<font color="yellow">Ms Hwang left the house.</font>

376
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,750
<font color="yellow">Leave the house? Where did she go?</font>

377
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,210
<font color="yellow">She's at Hwang Jae Man's house in Hongeun-dong.</font>

378
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,910
<font color="yellow">What's with her?</font>

379
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,180
<font color="yellow">She burnt all of my shirts while ironing them today.</font>

380
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,750
<font color="yellow">She must have ran away because she was scared, right?</font>

381
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,950
<font color="yellow">What's with this pan?</font>

382
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,750
<font color="yellow">Mum, I don't want those eggs.</font>

383
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

384
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,380
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

385
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,580
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask? I didn't like the side dishes,</font>

386
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,280
<font color="yellow">so I wanted to make fried eggs for Gwang Woo.</font>

387
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,980
<font color="yellow">You can't rub this all over the pan.</font>

388
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,110
<font color="yellow">It's completely ruined. Look at this.</font>

389
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,850
<font color="yellow">It's not my fault. It's because of this cheap pan.</font>

390
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,380
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it's cheap for you,</font>

391
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,580
<font color="yellow">but it was rather expensive for me.</font>

392
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,450
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Congresswoman. You're awful.</font>

393
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,210
<font color="yellow">I'll get a truck full of these pans if you want.</font>

394
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,580
<font color="yellow">Take that truck out and make some money.</font>

395
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,820
<font color="yellow">Stop watching television all day long.</font>

396
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,050
<font color="yellow">You're so lazy.</font>

397
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
<font color="yellow">How can I be treated like this?</font>

398
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,090
<font color="yellow">Mum, let's get out of here.</font>

399
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,980
<font color="yellow">What can we do? Do you have money?</font>

400
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,210
<font color="yellow">I'll get a private loan and get us a house.</font>

401
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,080
<font color="yellow">I really can't take how these people are treating you.</font>

402
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,210
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

403
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,180
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

404
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,580
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

405
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,010
<font color="yellow">It's your father.</font>

406
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,060
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

407
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,380
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to know that?</font>

408
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,550
<font color="yellow">Come back home right this second.</font>

409
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

410
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,040
<font color="yellow">telling me to come home?</font>

411
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,980
<font color="yellow">I will forgive you.</font>

412
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,950
<font color="yellow">Don't be scared and come back.</font>

413
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,050
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

414
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,280
<font color="yellow">I hope...</font>

415
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,680
<font color="yellow">you're serious.</font>

416
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,080
<font color="yellow">People make mistakes.</font>

417
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,180
<font color="yellow">It's okay, come back.</font>

418
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,580
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Honey.</font>

419
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,980
<font color="yellow">I'll be there soon.</font>

420
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,680
<font color="yellow">He's forgiving us.</font>

421
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,680
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

422
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,050
<font color="yellow">Pack your stuff.</font>

423
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,450
<font color="yellow">Let's get out of this house.</font>

424
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,300
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mum.</font>

425
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,450
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
-  Yes, let's go.</font>

426
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,050
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

427
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,050
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
-  I'm here, Dad.</font>

428
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,010
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

429
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,910
<font color="yellow">Why are they here?</font>

430
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,450
<font color="yellow">You called them today...</font>

431
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,280
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

432
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,480
<font color="yellow">You told us to come back and that you forgive us.</font>

433
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,470
<font color="yellow">Who forgave whom?</font>

434
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,380
<font color="yellow">I heard you talk to Mum...</font>

435
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,550
<font color="yellow">I will never forgive you two even if that's the last thing I do.</font>

436
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,880
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong, get rid of them.</font>

437
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,050
<font color="yellow">Are you joking with us?</font>

438
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,080
<font color="yellow">You're the one who joked around with my life.</font>

439
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,480
<font color="yellow">What kind of nonsense is this?</font>

440
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,080
<font color="yellow">What? Nonsense?</font>

441
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,720
<font color="yellow">Get rid of them.</font>

442
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,050
<font color="yellow">Is this why you called us?</font>

443
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,580
<font color="yellow">Did you want to get rid of us again?</font>

444
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,180
<font color="yellow">If you're a chairman, act like one.</font>

445
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,310
<font color="yellow">Don't be cheap and childish!</font>

446
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,680
<font color="yellow">I can't eat like this. Let's go, Gwang Woo.</font>

447
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,280
<font color="yellow">You should...</font>

448
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
<font color="yellow">just hit me with a golf club.</font>

449
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,450
<font color="yellow">Even I won't...</font>

450
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,580
<font color="yellow">play a prank like this.</font>

451
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,780
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

452
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,310
<font color="yellow">Look into how I can get a restraining order.</font>

453
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

454
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,980
<font color="yellow">Give me a glass.</font>

455
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,850
<font color="yellow">Do you know why...</font>

456
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,780
<font color="yellow">I bought in shares for Dodo Hotel...</font>

457
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,810
<font color="yellow">instead of the holding company's shares?</font>

458
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,280
<font color="yellow">Didn't you expect its price to fall thanks to MK2 vaccine?</font>

459
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,580
<font color="yellow">When I gave over Dodo Pharmaceutical's shares,</font>

460
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,450
<font color="yellow">the patent for MK2 vaccine was not yet given.</font>

461
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,480
<font color="yellow">Did you want CEO Do Shin Young...</font>

462
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,960
<font color="yellow">to own the hotel?</font>

463
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,110
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't sell the holding company's stock...</font>

464
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,680
<font color="yellow">just for that reason.</font>

465
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,300
<font color="yellow">Then why?</font>

466
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,580
<font color="yellow">I'm going to change...</font>

467
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,750
<font color="yellow">the holding company...</font>

468
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,010
<font color="yellow">to Dodo Hotel.</font>

469
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,050
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

470
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,010
<font color="yellow">is that why you went into the Shareholders' Voting Agreement?</font>

471
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,310
<font color="yellow">With my shares...</font>

472
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,080
<font color="yellow">and Shin Young's shares,</font>

473
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,550
<font color="yellow">I may be able to become Dodo Group's chairman.</font>

474
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,210
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

475
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,860
<font color="yellow">pulling the trigger soon?</font>

476
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,110
<font color="yellow">Just as you said,</font>

477
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,290
<font color="yellow">I'll forget about Soo Yeon for now.</font>

478
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,310
<font color="yellow">I'll first destroy Gun Woo...</font>

479
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,980
<font color="yellow">and bring her back after that.</font>

480
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,380
<font color="yellow">If you stop me again then,</font>

481
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,280
<font color="yellow">I'll fire you.</font>

482
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,880
<font color="yellow">You have a meeting with the bankers tomorrow.</font>

483
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,010
<font color="yellow">I was about to cancel it. I'm glad I didn't.</font>

484
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,010
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang.</font>

485
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,110
<font color="yellow">You're always too busy to go play golf with me.</font>

486
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,810
<font color="yellow">Why did you gather us today?</font>

487
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,680
<font color="yellow">You meet with the vice chairman of Dodo Group often, don't you?</font>

488
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,050
<font color="yellow">That's because of the Chinese ship order.</font>

489
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,950
<font color="yellow">We're in the process of reviewing his application for a loan.</font>

490
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,610
<font color="yellow">- Mr Moon.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

491
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,910
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group's bidding price is...</font>

492
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,950
<font color="yellow">62,277,690 dollars.</font>

493
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,510
<font color="yellow">This is a detailed outline of our agreement conditions.</font>

494
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,410
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

495
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,480
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if they'll be able to meet the conditions listed here.</font>

496
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

497
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,280
<font color="yellow">that you will break the agreement?</font>

498
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,410
<font color="yellow">The contract will stay as it is. The problem is...</font>

499
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,910
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if they can make ships of great quality.</font>

500
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,050
<font color="yellow">What is he talking about?</font>

501
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,050
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of banks that go bankrupt after giving out loans.</font>

502
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,150
<font color="yellow">If you need this document, please do let me know.</font>

503
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,010
<font color="yellow">I intend on sharing it with you...</font>

504
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,280
<font color="yellow">if you would like to see it.</font>

505
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,050
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you can't give us a loan?</font>

506
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,380
<font color="yellow">This deal is worth over 600 million dollars.</font>

507
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,010
<font color="yellow">Our bank isn't doing too well.</font>

508
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,510
<font color="yellow">You said you would just a few days ago.</font>

509
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,180
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I was too hasty...</font>

510
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,150
<font color="yellow">in giving you my personal opinion.</font>

511
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,750
<font color="yellow">Is it Congressman Hwang's doing?</font>

512
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,150
<font color="yellow">It's not just you. The other banks also declined to give us a loan.</font>

513
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,080
<font color="yellow">It seems like someone is behind this.</font>

514
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,610
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I have to rush to another meeting.</font>

515
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,180
<font color="yellow">Is it KT Corporation's Kang Gi Tan?</font>

516
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,850
<font color="yellow">I'll see you another time.</font>

517
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,380
<font color="yellow">We'll be in big trouble if we can't get that money.</font>

518
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,080
<font color="yellow">It's Gi Tan. He's controlling everything from the behind.</font>

519
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,010
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is asking around everywhere for the loan.</font>

520
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,280
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon's helping Do Choong rearrange his assets, right?</font>

521
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,480
<font color="yellow">That's what I've heard.</font>

522
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,720
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak.</font>

523
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,110
<font color="yellow">Can you check with Soo Yeon on the status of his inheritance?</font>

524
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,880
<font color="yellow">I might be able to find out if I ask Nan Jeong.</font>

525
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,780
<font color="yellow">Please meet with the Korean director of Gold Bank in Hong Kong.</font>

526
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,150
<font color="yellow">Gold Bank is the one that's supervised by us.</font>

527
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,250
<font color="yellow">Why do you want me to meet with them?</font>

528
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,280
<font color="yellow">- We'll ask them for a loan.
-  Pardon?</font>

529
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,450
<font color="yellow">Not for us, but for Dodo Group.</font>

530
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,510
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you'll help Dodo Group?</font>

531
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,950
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo may be struggling now,</font>

532
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,180
<font color="yellow">but he'll end up finding the funds for the project.</font>

533
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,550
<font color="yellow">You're right. Dodo Group will manage to find it.</font>

534
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,840
<font color="yellow">That's why we should help.</font>

535
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,150
<font color="yellow">I'll give the Korean director a heads-up.</font>

536
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,780
<font color="yellow">Kang Ga Din.</font>

537
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,780
<font color="yellow">We have to study.</font>

538
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,780
<font color="yellow">Is it already time?</font>

539
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,080
<font color="yellow">Who would dress like that to study?</font>

540
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,980
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm here to study?</font>

541
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,980
<font color="yellow">I came to seduce my teacher.</font>

542
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,380
<font color="yellow">I study better when I dress like this.</font>

543
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,510
<font color="yellow">What kind of book is this?</font>

544
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,280
<font color="yellow">- What is this?
-  It says right there.</font>

545
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,510
<font color="yellow">"Economics for Dummies, Introduction to Economics".</font>

546
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,350
<font color="yellow">You can study this on your own.</font>

547
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,310
<font color="yellow">I've prepared your textbook. Follow me.</font>

548
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,450
<font color="yellow">Wait for me, Ga Din.</font>

549
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,750
<font color="yellow">What is all this?</font>

550
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,050
<font color="yellow">You need to study all of them.</font>

551
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,410
<font color="yellow">Finances, accounting, statistics, production management and more.</font>

552
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,110
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to study for the rest of my life?</font>

553
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,910
<font color="yellow">Everyone is supposed to study all their lives.</font>

554
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,110
<font color="yellow">When am I supposed to marry?</font>

555
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,050
<font color="yellow">First, read all of them. Read and then debate over and over.</font>

556
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,350
<font color="yellow">By then, your light head will become heavy.</font>

557
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,810
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll give it a try.</font>

558
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,380
<font color="yellow">I'm smart.</font>

559
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,850
<font color="yellow">I know. It's just empty, that's all.</font>

560
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sensitive when I study. Don't bother me.</font>

561
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,250
<font color="yellow">I'm going out for an hour.</font>

562
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,910
<font color="yellow">Don't fall asleep and study.</font>

563
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,980
<font color="yellow">"Debate"?</font>

564
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,780
<font color="yellow">I'll surprise you, Ga Din.</font>

565
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,610
<font color="yellow">Do Shin Young.</font>

566
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,110
<font color="yellow">Wake up. Shin Young!</font>

567
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,580
<font color="yellow">When did I fall asleep?</font>

568
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,280
<font color="yellow">I even drooled.</font>

569
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,520
<font color="yellow">How much did you read?</font>

570
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,950
<font color="yellow">A lot.</font>

571
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,380
<font color="yellow">- Let me check.
-  No, not this book.</font>

572
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,480
<font color="yellow">It's too fun. I won't give it to you.</font>

573
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,110
<font color="yellow">Is that why you were so deeply in sleep?</font>

574
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,250
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me. You...
-  No!</font>

575
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,310
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

576
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,650
<font color="yellow">In a situation like this, the man usually...</font>

577
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,250
<font color="yellow">kisses the girl in movies.</font>

578
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,410
<font color="yellow">- Chairman Kang.
-  The inheritance...</font>

579
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,080
<font color="yellow">- My apologies, Sir.
-  We'll come back later.</font>

580
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,910
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

581
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,070
<font color="yellow">Shin Young was...</font>

582
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,170
<font color="yellow">You're a naughty teacher.</font>

583
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,610
<font color="yellow">You should mind your surroundings.</font>

584
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,110
<font color="yellow">What? Shin Young, you...</font>

585
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,780
<font color="yellow">It's okay. We'll get married anyway.</font>

586
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,020
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

587
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,550
<font color="yellow">What is happening with Chairman Do's inheritance?</font>

588
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,710
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is going to receive 80 percent...</font>

589
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,280
<font color="yellow">of Chairman Do's assets.</font>

590
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,710
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? What about me?</font>

591
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,710
<font color="yellow">You get the remaining 20 percent.</font>

592
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,810
<font color="yellow">How can he divide the inheritance like that?</font>

593
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,680
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

594
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,650
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I got angry.</font>

595
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,710
<font color="yellow">I'm going to pay my dad a visit.</font>

596
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,180
<font color="yellow">What do you plan on doing?</font>

597
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,680
<font color="yellow">What do you think? I'll confront him.</font>

598
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,610
<font color="yellow">Shin Young. Who am I?</font>

599
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,810
<font color="yellow">Who else? You're Kang Ga Din.</font>

600
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,710
<font color="yellow">We signed the Shareholders' Voting Agreement. We're partners.</font>

601
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,180
<font color="yellow">- So?
-  Just do as I say.</font>

602
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,850
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure you get all of Chairman Do's inheritance.</font>

603
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,350
<font color="yellow">- Really?
-  Mr Moon,</font>

604
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,980
<font color="yellow">how did it go with Gold Bank?</font>

605
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,050
<font color="yellow">It went well.</font>

606
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,110
<font color="yellow">How long...</font>

607
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,250
<font color="yellow">do I have to get these shots?</font>

608
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,750
<font color="yellow">The side effects from the medicine are severe. You need it for a while.</font>

609
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,950
<font color="yellow">Please take care.</font>

610
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,780
<font color="yellow">Repeat what you said earlier.</font>

611
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,250
<font color="yellow">The banks are declining your request for a loan?</font>

612
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,180
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

613
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,580
<font color="yellow">If you can't even persuade a mere banker,</font>

614
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,880
<font color="yellow">how can you run a business?</font>

615
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,080
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. The fund problem will be resolved soon.</font>

616
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,750
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

617
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,110
<font color="yellow">Do you think the shipowners will wait for you forever?</font>

618
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,910
<font color="yellow">Please trust me.</font>

619
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,680
<font color="yellow">- Mr Gong.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

620
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,180
<font color="yellow">Set a time for me with the bankers. I'll solve it myself.</font>

621
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,350
<font color="yellow">He can't meet with the bankers.</font>

622
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,810
<font color="yellow">I know that. He might talk nonsense in front of them.</font>

623
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,870
<font color="yellow">If that happens, our company will be at a risk.</font>

624
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,310
<font color="yellow">Please stop him.</font>

625
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,750
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that.</font>

626
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,410
<font color="yellow">Are you Doctor Hwang Seung Man?</font>

627
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,710
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  Chairman Hwang wants to see you.</font>

628
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,980
<font color="yellow">Here is Dr Hwang.</font>

629
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,350
<font color="yellow">Long time no see, Dr Hwang.</font>

630
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,520
<font color="yellow">It has already been a year since we had a drink.</font>

631
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

632
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,250
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me?</font>

633
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,020
<font color="yellow">Do Choong.</font>

634
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,610
<font color="yellow">What does he have?</font>

635
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,350
<font color="yellow">The side effects of his medication...</font>

636
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,410
<font color="yellow">Are you saying his medication caused dementia?</font>

637
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,180
<font color="yellow">It's not dementia.</font>

638
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,380
<font color="yellow">Dr Hwang!</font>

639
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,180
<font color="yellow">You appeared on TV...</font>

640
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,980
<font color="yellow">and we gave you a plaque for your outstanding services.</font>

641
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,150
<font color="yellow">Must I...</font>

642
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,650
<font color="yellow">reveal your true colours to make you tell the truth?</font>

643
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,310
<font color="yellow">Do Choong.</font>

644
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,880
<font color="yellow">What illness does he have?</font>

645
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
<font color="yellow">It is...</font>

646
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,680
<font color="yellow">dementia.</font>

647
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:53,910
<font color="yellow">It is...</font>

648
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,150
<font color="yellow">getting worse.</font>

649
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,280
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

650
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,550
<font color="yellow">Did he pay you off...</font>

651
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,350
<font color="yellow">to keep quiet?</font>

652
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,710
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

653
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,410
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

654
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,410
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

655
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,890
<font color="yellow">Does he really have dementia?</font>

656
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,080
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo told Doctor Hwang...</font>

657
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,680
<font color="yellow">to keep it a secret until...</font>

658
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,000
<font color="yellow">the inheritance has been distributed.</font>

659
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,950
<font color="yellow">That means he's hiding Father's illness...</font>

660
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,710
<font color="yellow">so he can take what isn't his.</font>

661
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,020
<font color="yellow">It's pretty obvious what he's up to.</font>

662
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
<font color="yellow">He's so evil.</font>

663
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,290
<font color="yellow">How could he do such a thing?</font>

664
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,640
<font color="yellow">You're just as bad.</font>

665
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,450
<font color="yellow">You swapped his medication.</font>

666
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,590
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

667
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,250
<font color="yellow">fanning the flames?</font>

668
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,680
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling?</font>

669
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,610
<font color="yellow">We can't waste time.</font>

670
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,080
<font color="yellow">We have to tell Father...</font>

671
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,910
<font color="yellow">what Gun Woo is really up to.</font>

672
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,810
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

673
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,650
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  It's me, Gwang Woo.</font>

674
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,610
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

675
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,450
<font color="yellow">You're being deceived.</font>

676
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,750
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

677
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,310
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

678
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,350
<font color="yellow">have dementia.</font>

679
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,610
<font color="yellow">What? Dementia?</font>

680
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, dementia.</font>

681
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,350
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo and Doctor Hwang...</font>

682
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,980
<font color="yellow">ganged up on you to hoodwink you.</font>

683
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,780
<font color="yellow">Are you listening?</font>

684
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,310
<font color="yellow">Keep talking.</font>

685
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,350
<font color="yellow">You're rewriting your will, aren't you?</font>

686
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,550
<font color="yellow">Stop it right now.</font>

687
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,470
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo's putting you in danger...</font>

688
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,910
<font color="yellow">so he can take everything you have.</font>

689
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,290
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

690
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,480
<font color="yellow">I'll come over...</font>

691
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,180
<font color="yellow">and explain everything.</font>

692
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,020
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

693
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

694
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,680
<font color="yellow">Dementia?</font>

695
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,410
<font color="yellow">Why don't you pray that I die?</font>

696
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,680
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk such nonsense!</font>

697
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,730
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

698
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:09,660
<font color="yellow">I filed for a restraining order against you.</font>

699
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,580
<font color="yellow">Come by and see what happens.</font>

700
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,580
<font color="yellow">A restraining order?</font>

701
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,650
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

702
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,880
<font color="yellow">A restraining order?</font>

703
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,910
<font color="yellow">For as long as I live,</font>

704
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,080
<font color="yellow">I will fight to take back the assets I gave...</font>

705
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,860
<font color="yellow">to you and your mother.</font>

706
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,380
<font color="yellow">Let's see you two end up without a penny!</font>

707
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,750
<font color="yellow">Did he just say...</font>

708
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,550
<font color="yellow">he filed for a restraining order?</font>

709
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,950
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

710
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,580
<font color="yellow">This is all Gun Woo's fault.</font>

711
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,150
<font color="yellow">He is...</font>

712
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,380
<font color="yellow">controlling Father like a puppet.</font>

713
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,710
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

714
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,680
<font color="yellow">Help us, Jae Man.</font>

715
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,480
<font color="yellow">How dare he make me...</font>

716
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,610
<font color="yellow">as a dementia patient?</font>

717
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,780
<font color="yellow">If I don't keep my wits about me,</font>

718
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,110
<font color="yellow">they might take things from under my nose.</font>

719
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,850
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

720
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,310
<font color="yellow">I'd like to have dinner with you.</font>

721
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,180
<font color="yellow">I'm in no mood for that. Let's eat...</font>

722
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,310
<font color="yellow">This is Kang Gi Tan.</font>

723
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,450
<font color="yellow">Are you busy preparing for the appeal?</font>

724
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,010
<font color="yellow">We have to make sure Il Jae remains behind bars.</font>

725
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,650
<font color="yellow">What's a vice chairman doing skipping meals?</font>

726
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,910
<font color="yellow">I had a long day.</font>

727
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,150
<font color="yellow">Can you not get a loan?</font>

728
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

729
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:16,580
<font color="yellow">I think Gi Tan got to the banks before I did.</font>

730
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,250
<font color="yellow">Why would he?</font>

731
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,910
<font color="yellow">I think he wants Dodo Group.</font>

732
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,480
<font color="yellow">That might be why he keeps Shin Young close.</font>

733
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,650
<font color="yellow">He approached her on purpose?</font>

734
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:28,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I'm right.</font>

735
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,680
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't do such a thing.</font>

736
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,450
<font color="yellow">Have you...</font>

737
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,110
<font color="yellow">heard from him?</font>

738
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,350
<font color="yellow">No. I guess he's busy.</font>

739
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,480
<font color="yellow">I was too busy with the trial to call him too.</font>

740
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,180
<font color="yellow">His memory...</font>

741
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,610
<font color="yellow">must be back by now.</font>

742
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,750
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking about?</font>

743
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,750
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

744
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,350
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

745
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,710
<font color="yellow">(Kang Gi Tan)</font>

746
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,010
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

747
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,150
<font color="yellow">I have something to say.</font>

748
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,510
<font color="yellow">Shall we meet?</font>

749
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,250
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way to a dinner appointment.</font>

750
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,510
<font color="yellow">Do you want to join us?</font>

751
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,100
<font color="yellow">Can I?</font>

752
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,110
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

753
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,550
<font color="yellow">You know everyone.</font>

754
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,610
<font color="yellow">Give me the address.</font>

755
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,110
<font color="yellow">Write it down, Soo Yeon.</font>

756
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,510
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

757
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,610
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

758
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,510
<font color="yellow">with Soo Yeon right now?</font>

759
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,580
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm at her place eating dinner.</font>

760
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,120
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

761
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,380
<font color="yellow">Can't you breathe?</font>

762
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,110
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

763
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,090
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

764
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,780
<font color="yellow">must be with Shin Young.</font>

765
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,980
<font color="yellow">I'll text you the address.</font>

766
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,350
<font color="yellow">Be there.</font>

767
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,580
<font color="yellow">Am I allowed to be there?</font>

768
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,750
<font color="yellow">I'm going to ask Gi Tan for funds.</font>

769
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,510
<font color="yellow">You can offer some moral support.</font>

770
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,110
<font color="yellow">Welcome, Gun Woo.</font>

771
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,680
<font color="yellow">Hello, Lawyer Oh.</font>

772
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,610
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

773
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,260
<font color="yellow">Why are you here, Father?</font>

774
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,310
<font color="yellow">Say hello.</font>

775
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,080
<font color="yellow">He's the vice chairman of Gold Bank in Hong Kong.</font>

776
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,250
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you. I'm Johnny Kim.</font>

777
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,120
<font color="yellow">I'm Do Gun Woo.</font>

778
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,710
<font color="yellow">Gold Bank offered...</font>

779
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,150
<font color="yellow">to lend you the money...</font>

780
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,150
<font color="yellow">with a refund guarantee.</font>

781
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,250
<font color="yellow">Chairman K negotiated the deal.</font>

782
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,280
<font color="yellow">I should go, Sir.</font>

783
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,180
<font color="yellow">I will walk you out.</font>

784
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,410
<font color="yellow">I won't go far.</font>

785
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,150
<font color="yellow">You helped us...</font>

786
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,450
<font color="yellow">avert a huge crisis.</font>

787
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,450
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

788
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:24,110
<font color="yellow">I saw you run left and right trying to secure funding.</font>

789
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,900
<font color="yellow">It upset Shin Young, too.</font>

790
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,870
<font color="yellow">She asked me to intervene.</font>

791
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,310
<font color="yellow">Chairman K...</font>

792
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,510
<font color="yellow">does anything and everything I ask him to.</font>

793
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,450
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

794
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,410
<font color="yellow">Don't you think they make a lovely couple?</font>

795
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,380
<font color="yellow">They do.</font>

796
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,910
<font color="yellow">I wholeheartedly support their marriage.</font>

797
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,080
<font color="yellow">What made you side with me this time?</font>

798
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,480
<font color="yellow">There are rumours that Gun Woo will marry Lawyer Oh.</font>

799
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,380
<font color="yellow">Do you have your father's approval?</font>

800
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,910
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

801
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:03,510
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

802
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,180
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo has no intention of getting married yet.</font>

803
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,280
<font color="yellow">You know his condition.</font>

804
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,910
<font color="yellow">Don't get upset.</font>

805
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,250
<font color="yellow">You look sweet together.</font>

806
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,080
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

807
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,780
<font color="yellow">Don't you think Gun Woo and Lawyer Oh would get along well?</font>

808
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,180
<font color="yellow">Let's stop talking about that.</font>

809
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,860
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

810
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:29,910
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

811
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,850
<font color="yellow">When I amend your will, I'll revise the percentage of inheritance.</font>

812
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,750
<font color="yellow">Shin Young gets 50 percent.</font>

813
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,810
<font color="yellow">So does Gun Woo.</font>

814
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,110
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Dad.</font>

815
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:58,380
<font color="yellow">Now, I know why you offered to finance...</font>

816
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,510
<font color="yellow">the shipbuilding project.</font>

817
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,880
<font color="yellow">Are you the one who talked to the bank managers?</font>

818
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,010
<font color="yellow">One hand holds a carrot, the other a whip.</font>

819
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,880
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the lesson.</font>

820
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,650
<font color="yellow">I still have a lot to teach you. If you want to learn,</font>

821
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,280
<font color="yellow">- try being humble.
-  Do you...</font>

822
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,710
<font color="yellow">remember your past...</font>

823
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,450
<font color="yellow">with Soo Yeon?</font>

824
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,780
<font color="yellow">Is your memory back?</font>

825
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,550
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

826
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,850
<font color="yellow">In its full detail.</font>

827
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,250
<font color="yellow">You can take the upper hand in business,</font>

828
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,400
<font color="yellow">but I will not give up Soo Yeon.</font>

829
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,780
<font color="yellow">Don't dream of taking her back. Give up while you can.</font>

830
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,250
<font color="yellow">I already did.</font>

831
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,180
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

832
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,410
<font color="yellow">I don't care about her.</font>

833
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,280
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't say something like that.</font>

834
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,380
<font color="yellow">I guess you spread the rumour that you two were engaged.</font>

835
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,510
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I will marry her.</font>

836
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,310
<font color="yellow">Focus on the business.</font>

837
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,880
<font color="yellow">Lose Dodo Group...</font>

838
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,250
<font color="yellow">and you lose Soo Yeon, too.</font>

839
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,310
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

840
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,180
<font color="yellow">Stop flirting with my Gi Tan.</font>

841
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,300
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm flirting with him?</font>

842
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,110
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

843
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,250
<font color="yellow">I can see all nine of your foxy tails.</font>

844
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,550
<font color="yellow">They squirm.</font>

845
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,950
<font color="yellow">- Maybe you're just insecure.
-  What?</font>

846
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,540
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're a match for me?</font>

847
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,410
<font color="yellow">If you don't think so,</font>

848
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,070
<font color="yellow">then don't mind me.</font>

849
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,250
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

850
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,010
<font color="yellow">Do you know what love is?</font>

851
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,110
<font color="yellow">I do. I know very well.</font>

852
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:57,110
<font color="yellow">No, you don't know.</font>

853
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,750
<font color="yellow">It hurts you so deep...</font>

854
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,710
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to lecture me?</font>

855
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:09,980
<font color="yellow">If you want to love Gi Tan,</font>

856
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,080
<font color="yellow">find out where he hurts the most.</font>

857
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,680
<font color="yellow">Stop acting like a selfish child.</font>

858
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,310
<font color="yellow">Being able to suffer with him...</font>

859
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,810
<font color="yellow">gives you the right to love him.</font>

860
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,780
<font color="yellow">What a brat.</font>

861
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,280
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel like I just lost?</font>

862
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,950
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving?</font>

863
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,150
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

864
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,810
<font color="yellow">You didn't eat much earlier.</font>

865
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,550
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me. I should go.</font>

866
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,950
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

867
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,280
<font color="yellow">I'll call you that from now on.</font>

868
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,000
<font color="yellow">Please don't. It makes me feel uncomfortable.</font>

869
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,080
<font color="yellow">We used to be close colleagues.</font>

870
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,110
<font color="yellow">Maybe you thought we were close, but I didn't think so.</font>

871
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,310
<font color="yellow">I apologise. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.</font>

872
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,780
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

873
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,450
<font color="yellow">- Eat up.
-  Thanks.</font>

874
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,450
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

875
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,850
<font color="yellow">What brings you to our tiny office?</font>

876
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,180
<font color="yellow">- Send everyone out.
-  Pardon?</font>

877
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,180
<font color="yellow">They were just about to eat their noodles.</font>

878
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,380
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

879
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,110
<font color="yellow">You can take the noodles with you.</font>

880
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,850
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

881
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:31,610
<font color="yellow">Drop everything else and keep an eye on Kang Gi Tan.</font>

882
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,250
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Find out where he goes,</font>

883
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,150
<font color="yellow">what he does and who he meets.</font>

884
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,050
<font color="yellow">I want a full report on everything.</font>

885
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir. I'll put my boys...</font>

886
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,410
<font color="yellow">- Do it yourself.
-  Me?</font>

887
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,250
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty high up the ladder now. I don't do...</font>

888
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,650
<font color="yellow">Do as you're told.</font>

889
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,350
<font color="yellow">Yang Dong Yi.</font>

890
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,050
<font color="yellow">Don't try to pull anything. I'm not like Gwang Woo.</font>

891
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,680
<font color="yellow">I get what you mean.</font>

892
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,450
<font color="yellow">I'll do it myself.</font>

893
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,600
<font color="yellow">They're quick to notice things. Don't get caught.</font>

894
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,910
<font color="yellow">I won't, Sir.</font>

895
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,110
<font color="yellow">Checkmate.</font>

896
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,180
<font color="yellow">Oh dear, I didn't see the cannon there.</font>

897
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,480
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group's loan from Gold Bank...</font>

898
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,970
<font color="yellow">means we practically control their finances.</font>

899
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,750
<font color="yellow">What should come next?</font>

900
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,350
<font color="yellow">Out of check.</font>

901
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,580
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be liabilities?</font>

902
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,650
<font color="yellow">Correct.</font>

903
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,880
<font color="yellow">Once we control their debt,</font>

904
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,760
<font color="yellow">we control most of Dodo Group.</font>

905
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,580
<font color="yellow">The audit files I saw when I worked there...</font>

906
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,810
<font color="yellow">listed a lot of bonds that mature this year.</font>

907
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,110
<font color="yellow">Could you get a list of the owners...</font>

908
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,280
<font color="yellow">of those bonds?</font>

909
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:56,370
<font color="yellow">That shouldn't be too hard. I still know people who work there.</font>

910
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,580
<font color="yellow">But most of the owners of the bonds...</font>

911
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,380
<font color="yellow">are loan sharks.</font>

912
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,910
<font color="yellow">Loan sharks?</font>

913
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:06,050
<font color="yellow">Checkmate.</font>

914
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,750
<font color="yellow">You got me again.</font>

915
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,510
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is on high alert.</font>

916
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,580
<font color="yellow">We have to buy the bonds...</font>

917
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,250
<font color="yellow">before he notices.</font>

918
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,480
<font color="yellow">Loan sharks?</font>

919
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,850
<font color="yellow">He's sniffing around private money markets?</font>

920
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:31,680
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan doesn't move in person.</font>

921
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,250
<font color="yellow">Moon Tae Gwang's doing all the legwork.</font>

922
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:40,480
<font color="yellow">It didn't look like he was borrowing money.</font>

923
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,180
<font color="yellow">Bonds.</font>

924
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:44,810
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

925
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,750
<font color="yellow">The matured bonds.</font>

926
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,250
<font color="yellow">That's what he's after.</font>

927
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,950
<font color="yellow">I heard that someone there owns a lot of bonds...</font>

928
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,410
<font color="yellow">belonging to Dodo Group.</font>

929
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,110
<font color="yellow">We have to stop him. If Gi Tan buys those bonds,</font>

930
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,850
<font color="yellow">then Dodo Group is doomed.</font>

931
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,950
<font color="yellow">The day we get the matured bonds...</font>

932
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,550
<font color="yellow">will be the day Dodo Group shuts down.</font>

933
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:10,010
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you should meet one of the bigger financiers?</font>

934
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,810
<font color="yellow">- I should.
-  I heard that...</font>

935
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,580
<font color="yellow">he's pretty cranky.</font>

936
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,710
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I can deal with that.</font>

937
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,280
<font color="yellow">Il Jae's appeal begins today. Shouldn't you be there?</font>

938
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,250
<font color="yellow">I should.</font>

939
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,950
<font color="yellow">I'd love to see him scrunch up his ugly face.</font>

940
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,180
<font color="yellow">- How does that feel?
-  Good.</font>

941
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,350
<font color="yellow">I wish you luck today.</font>

942
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:53,450
<font color="yellow">I won't be coming back here.</font>

943
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:55,850
<font color="yellow">I'll pray for you.</font>

944
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,750
<font color="yellow">Choong Dong.</font>

945
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,820
<font color="yellow">You might have to stay here a little longer.</font>

946
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,080
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.</font>

947
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,810
<font color="yellow">I'll do what I can to get you paroled soon.</font>

948
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:34,350
<font color="yellow">Is Prosecutor Choi worth trusting?</font>

949
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,850
<font color="yellow">He said he'd go for the highest sentence possible.</font>

950
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,350
<font color="yellow">All rise and greet the judge.</font>

951
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,080
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you want to announce your candidacy today?</font>

952
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,750
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo.</font>

953
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,850
<font color="yellow">I survived...</font>

954
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,080
<font color="yellow">the corrupt world of politics...</font>

955
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,720
<font color="yellow">for this day.</font>

956
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,450
<font color="yellow">That's what worries me.</font>

957
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,580
<font color="yellow">Il Jae's trial begins today and I don't want that...</font>

958
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,750
<font color="yellow">to get you into trouble again.</font>

959
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,480
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that.</font>

960
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,980
<font color="yellow">While I campaign to become president,</font>

961
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,150
<font color="yellow">I will not have to worry about Il Jae.</font>

962
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,910
<font color="yellow">It's time to leave for your press conference.</font>

963
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:52,650
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

964
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,950
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

965
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:58,980
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae.</font>

966
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,980
<font color="yellow">You bribed another candidate...</font>

967
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:07,420
<font color="yellow">and we have clear evidence you tried to cover it up.</font>

968
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,510
<font color="yellow">You violated election laws.</font>

969
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,550
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

970
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,950
<font color="yellow">the charges of abduction and...</font>

971
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,350
<font color="yellow">attempted murder of lawyer Oh Soo Yeon...</font>

972
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,110
<font color="yellow">lacks evidence.</font>

973
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:23,180
<font color="yellow">I will not charge you for that.</font>

974
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,480
<font color="yellow">Therefore, this court sentences Byun Il Jae...</font>

975
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,250
<font color="yellow">to two years in prison and three years in probation.</font>

976
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,280
<font color="yellow">Doesn't that mean he gets out?</font>

977
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,950
<font color="yellow">What kind of a paralegal doesn't know that?</font>

978
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,280
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang Jae Man is here.</font>

979
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:25,050
<font color="yellow">- Hwang Jae Man.
-  Hwang Jae Man.</font>

980
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,410
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

981
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,150
<font color="yellow">Take your seats.</font>

982
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,080
<font color="yellow">Could I ask you a question first?</font>

983
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,850
<font color="yellow">Your son-in-law...</font>

984
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,750
<font color="yellow">mayoral elect Byun Il Jae's appeal is underway right now.</font>

985
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,180
<font color="yellow">Isn't this a bad time to run for president?</font>

986
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,310
<font color="yellow">You're getting ahead of yourself.</font>

987
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:45,550
<font color="yellow">I see you aren't aware that...</font>

988
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,750
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae...</font>

989
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,380
<font color="yellow">is no longer...</font>

990
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,380
<font color="yellow">my son-in-law.</font>

991
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,950
<font color="yellow">He is in the process...</font>

992
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:58,750
<font color="yellow">of divorcing my daughter.</font>

993
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,280
<font color="yellow">If you don't believe me,</font>

994
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:03,950
<font color="yellow">once we are done here,</font>

995
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,780
<font color="yellow">check the public records yourselves.</font>

996
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:13,980
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

997
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:17,160
<font color="yellow">The prosecutor broke every promise he made.</font>

998
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,900
<font color="yellow">He didn't use the reports I gave him.</font>

999
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,280
<font color="yellow">He didn't even ask any questions.</font>

1000
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,180
<font color="yellow">The trial's over.</font>

1001
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,410
<font color="yellow">I'll take him to Supreme Court.</font>

1002
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:27,880
<font color="yellow">Everything he did...</font>

1003
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,950
<font color="yellow">Prosecution refused to appeal!</font>

1004
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:34,580
<font color="yellow">That's the reality...</font>

1005
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,410
<font color="yellow">of the legal system...</font>

1006
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,980
<font color="yellow">we believed in.</font>

1007
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,180
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

1008
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,810
<font color="yellow">judge Il Jae myself.</font>

1009
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,680
<font color="yellow">I can do better than this.</font>

1010
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,310
<font color="yellow">I, Hwang Jae Man,</font>

1011
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,680
<font color="yellow">will run for presidency of the Republic of Korea.</font>

1012
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:37,610
<font color="yellow">This is my promise to you.</font>

1013
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,680
<font color="yellow">Justice.</font>

1014
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:43,410
<font color="yellow">A society in which justice prevails.</font>

1015
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,180
<font color="yellow">As of today,</font>

1016
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,950
<font color="yellow">I declare war against...</font>

1017
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,610
<font color="yellow">corruption and all things illegal!</font>

1018
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,750
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

1019
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,610
<font color="yellow">finally back, Guk Cheol.</font>

1020
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,150
<font color="yellow">(Monster)</font>

1021
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,440
<font color="yellow">He betrayed him?</font>

1022
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,450
<font color="yellow">He'll be willing to meet me at least.</font>

1023
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:46,080
<font color="yellow">It's worth the try if we get the timing right.</font>

1024
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,910
<font color="yellow">You must stick to me.</font>

1025
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:51,220
<font color="yellow">Did you have anything to do with Gwang Woo killing Gi Tan's parents?</font>

1026
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:54,050
<font color="yellow">I think we should let Dad go.</font>

1027
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,310
<font color="yellow">You stand a chance if we help you.</font>

1028
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,310
<font color="yellow">Are you suggesting we join forces?</font>

1029
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:59,400
<font color="yellow">It's about what happens next.</font>

1030
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,750
<font color="yellow">This is Kang Gi Tan. Could we meet?</font>
