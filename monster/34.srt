<font color="yellow">That's Soo Yeon's car.</font>

3
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,660
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, I need you to wake up.</font>

4
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,120
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon.</font>

5
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,920
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

6
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,250
<font color="yellow">I got her.</font>

7
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,650
<font color="yellow">Great job.</font>

8
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,020
<font color="yellow">Make sure everything ends cleanly.</font>

9
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,450
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

10
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,790
<font color="yellow">You mustn't leave any evidence that Soo Yeon's been murdered.</font>

11
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,220
<font color="yellow">Make it look like she killed herself because of her brother.</font>

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,220
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

13
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,020
<font color="yellow">Go to the bridge in Yangsu-ri.</font>

14
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,420
<font color="yellow">That's a pretty desolate place...</font>

15
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,590
<font color="yellow">and a lot of people commit suicide there.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Moon Tae Gwang)</font>

17
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,790
<font color="yellow">Chairman, something happened.</font>

18
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,950
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

19
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,850
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh has been abducted by Il Jae.</font>

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,950
<font color="yellow">They're headed to a bridge in Yangsu-ri.</font>

21
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,120
<font color="yellow">We'll leave immediately.</font>

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,020
<font color="yellow">You don't have to go yourself.</font>

23
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,490
<font color="yellow">Her abduction is not...</font>

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,250
<font color="yellow">completely irrelevant with me.</font>

25
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
<font color="yellow">Drive as fast as you can.</font>

26
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

27
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,090
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

28
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,950
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon!</font>

29
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,020
<font color="yellow">There isn't anyone on the bridge.</font>

30
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,890
<font color="yellow">- What about the police?
-  I think we got here before them.</font>

31
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,790
<font color="yellow">Sir, over there!</font>

32
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,220
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, no. Soo Yeon.</font>

33
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

34
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,790
<font color="yellow">No, Soo Yeon. Don't die.</font>

35
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,690
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, no.</font>

36
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,690
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

37
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,120
<font color="yellow">Good job. You did it.</font>

38
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,190
<font color="yellow">My cottage is nearby, right?</font>

39
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,720
<font color="yellow">We should move them there.</font>

40
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,290
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir.</font>

41
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,220
<font color="yellow">Il Jae...</font>

42
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,850
<font color="yellow">must have decided to give up being human.</font>

43
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,490
<font color="yellow">It could have been really dangerous if we were late.</font>

44
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,550
<font color="yellow">The police want to question the victim. What should we do?</font>

45
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,990
<font color="yellow">I want...</font>

46
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,490
<font color="yellow">to remain dead to Il Jae until the day of the election.</font>

47
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,220
<font color="yellow">Il Jae...</font>

48
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,120
<font color="yellow">will make it seem like it's Choong Dong's doing.</font>

49
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,420
<font color="yellow">My bag disappeared.</font>

50
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they'll think that we're going for the slush fund.</font>

51
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,150
<font color="yellow">It'll be best to do as she says if we want to make...</font>

52
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,250
<font color="yellow">the surprise announcement on her show.</font>

53
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,990
<font color="yellow">Why don't you stay in China?</font>

54
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,790
<font color="yellow">It's close enough and it'll be a good place to hide.</font>

55
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,490
<font color="yellow">There's no need.</font>

56
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,050
<font color="yellow">I won't be tricked in the same way.</font>

57
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,050
<font color="yellow">You don't have to help me.</font>

58
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,320
<font color="yellow">You're like a bomb to Chairman Kang.</font>

59
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,290
<font color="yellow">- I know that already.
-  That's why...</font>

60
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,790
<font color="yellow">I would prefer if you didn't stimulate him.</font>

61
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,850
<font color="yellow">Don't be too close or too distant from him.</font>

62
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,150
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

63
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Lawyer Oh.</font>

64
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,990
<font color="yellow">Once they find a cure for him, I'll let you know first.</font>

65
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,050
<font color="yellow">I don't expect them to.</font>

66
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,120
<font color="yellow">I'm just thankful that Gi Tan is alive.</font>

67
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,890
<font color="yellow">I think it's best for you to go to China.</font>

68
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,350
<font color="yellow">There isn't anywhere safer right now.</font>

69
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,290
<font color="yellow">I would appreciate it if you can help.</font>

70
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,720
<font color="yellow">- Soo Tak, leave with her tomorrow.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

71
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,390
<font color="yellow">You should file for a missing person as well.</font>

72
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,220
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Min will take care of it.</font>

73
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,550
<font color="yellow">This is what Soo Yeon had with her.</font>

74
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Gi Tan has this document as well.</font>

75
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,650
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, it's not an important document.</font>

76
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,850
<font color="yellow">He couldn't have found out anything from this.</font>

77
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,220
<font color="yellow">I'll get rid of Gi Tan after the election is over.</font>

78
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,290
<font color="yellow">Good job, Choong Dong.</font>

79
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,020
<font color="yellow">I followed your orders,</font>

80
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,520
<font color="yellow">but I'm a little concerned.</font>

81
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,390
<font color="yellow">There is no need...</font>

82
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,790
<font color="yellow">to be concerned for what hasn't happened yet.</font>

83
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,890
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

84
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,150
<font color="yellow">That's how I lived all my life.</font>

85
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,960
<font color="yellow">Just do your best in every moment.</font>

86
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,890
<font color="yellow">That will become your path.</font>

87
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,290
<font color="yellow">What do you plan on doing with Gun Woo?</font>

88
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,120
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of him...</font>

89
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,390
<font color="yellow">after the election as well.</font>

90
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,290
<font color="yellow">Have a safe trip to China. I'll call you.</font>

91
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,720
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Gun Woo.</font>

92
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,190
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for you,</font>

93
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,890
<font color="yellow">I would probably still be in that cold river.</font>

94
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,920
<font color="yellow">If something happens to you, there would be no point in living.</font>

95
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,020
<font color="yellow">Eat and sleep well in China.</font>

96
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,850
<font color="yellow">Call me if anything bothers you.</font>

97
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,850
<font color="yellow">Go to bed.</font>

98
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,790
<font color="yellow">You should tell me if anything bothers you as well.</font>

99
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,790
<font color="yellow">I'm a little slow, so I might...</font>

100
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,320
<font color="yellow">Don't be so complicated.</font>

101
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,850
<font color="yellow">You can let me comfort you. I'll console you.</font>

102
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,090
<font color="yellow">That'll make me happy.</font>

103
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

104
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,620
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung.</font>

105
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,290
<font color="yellow">Aren't you a little underdressed for breakfast?</font>

106
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,920
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I just woke up.</font>

107
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,820
<font color="yellow">Right. Congratulations, Mr Byun.</font>

108
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,250
<font color="yellow">The rating for the second candidate in line is eight percent lower.</font>

109
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,350
<font color="yellow">There's still a lot of room for changes.</font>

110
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,850
<font color="yellow">You must stay on your toes.</font>

111
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Hwang.</font>

112
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,850
<font color="yellow">- Are you eating?
-  Yes, come in.</font>

113
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,990
<font color="yellow">If you didn't eat, come join us.</font>

114
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,120
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  That's okay, I ate.</font>

115
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,490
<font color="yellow">I heard a strange news on my way here.</font>

116
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
<font color="yellow">What strange news?</font>

117
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,350
<font color="yellow">A police friend of mine says...</font>

118
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,590
<font color="yellow">that Soo Yeon has gone missing.</font>

119
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,820
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon?</font>

120
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,290
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

121
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,450
<font color="yellow">I don't know the details,</font>

122
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,490
<font color="yellow">but her law firm has filed for her missing.</font>

123
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,590
<font color="yellow">Honey, can I have more soup?</font>

124
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,050
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

125
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,790
<font color="yellow">It seems like you're enjoying the hospital food.</font>

126
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,190
<font color="yellow">After eating your food,</font>

127
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,320
<font color="yellow">anything tastes good.</font>

128
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,550
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're feeling better.</font>

129
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
<font color="yellow">He even took a walk this morning without the crutches.</font>

130
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,120
<font color="yellow">It's so strange.</font>

131
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,790
<font color="yellow">I get worse when I'm at home.</font>

132
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,120
<font color="yellow">Are the test results out?</font>

133
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,820
<font color="yellow">This was the problem.</font>

134
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,850
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

135
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,390
<font color="yellow">You gave me those pills.</font>

136
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,390
<font color="yellow">These are just supplements.</font>

137
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
<font color="yellow">Supplements?</font>

138
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,790
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I took supplements instead of...</font>

139
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,790
<font color="yellow">my blood pressure medication?</font>

140
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,390
<font color="yellow">I swear I prescribed medication for your blood pressure.</font>

141
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,120
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened.</font>

142
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,590
<font color="yellow">Who picked up the pills until now?</font>

143
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,990
<font color="yellow">I did and then stored them at home.</font>

144
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,490
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

145
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,450
<font color="yellow">someone switched them at home.</font>

146
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,620
<font color="yellow">That witch!</font>

147
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,620
<font color="yellow">- Sir!
-  Chairman!</font>

148
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,220
<font color="yellow">Is she trying to kill me?</font>

149
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,450
<font color="yellow">How can she?</font>

150
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,950
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't act rashly from having suspicions.</font>

151
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,720
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

152
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,120
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

153
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,290
<font color="yellow">You're busy with the EGM.</font>

154
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,890
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

155
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,790
<font color="yellow">- You're not well yet.
-  This is a family problem.</font>

156
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it's my wife.</font>

157
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,720
<font color="yellow">I'll deal with it.</font>

158
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,390
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

159
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,550
<font color="yellow">I want to be discharged right away.</font>

160
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,620
<font color="yellow">Give me some other pills.</font>

161
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,290
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
-  Also!</font>

162
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,450
<font color="yellow">Don't tell anyone about this.</font>

163
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,820
<font color="yellow">It's just between us.</font>

164
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,520
<font color="yellow">It'll be a secret, okay?</font>

165
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,790
<font color="yellow">Understood, Sir.</font>

166
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,290
<font color="yellow">You should pick that one.</font>

167
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,020
<font color="yellow">That's very elegant.</font>

168
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

169
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,620
<font color="yellow">It's my blind date. Can I wear what I want?</font>

170
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,620
<font color="yellow">His family is very conservative. They like neatly dressed people.</font>

171
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,590
<font color="yellow">Is he handsome?</font>

172
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,250
<font color="yellow">It's all about looks for me.</font>

173
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,820
<font color="yellow">Of course he is.</font>

174
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,020
<font color="yellow">He's got manners, a good family and good education.</font>

175
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,120
<font color="yellow">He's a perfect guy. Don't worry about it.</font>

176
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,690
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make him regret this.</font>

177
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,250
<font color="yellow">Wait. Why would you make him regret this?</font>

178
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,350
<font color="yellow">I wasn't talking about him.</font>

179
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,090
<font color="yellow">There's this awful guy.</font>

180
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,690
<font color="yellow">Mum. Dad is here.</font>

181
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,450
<font color="yellow">Is he discharged already?</font>

182
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,350
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Is he sick?</font>

183
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,920
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

184
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,220
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Are you really ill?</font>

185
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,590
<font color="yellow">Shin Young.</font>

186
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,850
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

187
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,650
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

188
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,520
<font color="yellow">I couldn't visit you often because I was busy with work.</font>

189
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,720
<font color="yellow">What did the doctor say?</font>

190
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,720
<font color="yellow">He received thorough examination,</font>

191
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,920
<font color="yellow">but we still do not know what's wrong.</font>

192
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,660
<font color="yellow">It must be very serious if Dr Hwang doesn't even know.</font>

193
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,290
<font color="yellow">He said his blood pressure medicine doesn't seem to be effective.</font>

194
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,990
<font color="yellow">So we got new ones.</font>

195
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,020
<font color="yellow">Is he changing medicines?</font>

196
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,190
<font color="yellow">Yes. Dr Hwang thought it would be a good idea.</font>

197
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you let us come to the hospital...</font>

198
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,890
<font color="yellow">if you were doing this badly?</font>

199
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,790
<font color="yellow">Seeing your mum...</font>

200
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,420
<font color="yellow">makes me worse.</font>

201
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
<font color="yellow">It looks like he's not doing so bad.</font>

202
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,520
<font color="yellow">He still has the energy to hate me.</font>

203
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
<font color="yellow">Shin Young.</font>

204
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,850
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

205
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,160
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

206
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,390
<font color="yellow">What if something happens to him?</font>

207
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,950
<font color="yellow">It's not the time to worry about him.</font>

208
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,220
<font color="yellow">You don't know what will happen to me at the general meeting.</font>

209
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,550
<font color="yellow">It looks like he's pretty sick.</font>

210
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,420
<font color="yellow">I don't think we need to worry about his reinstatement.</font>

211
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,450
<font color="yellow">Is he changing his blood pressure medicine?</font>

212
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,490
<font color="yellow">You have to be on my side...</font>

213
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,850
<font color="yellow">at the upcoming general meeting no matter what happens.</font>

214
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,820
<font color="yellow">I want to do that.</font>

215
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,620
<font color="yellow">- But...
-  But what?</font>

216
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,550
<font color="yellow">I heard you're giving the company to Gun Woo.</font>

217
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,590
<font color="yellow">I am completely against that.</font>

218
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,420
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo fell out of my favour,</font>

219
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
<font color="yellow">but Shin Young,</font>

220
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,790
<font color="yellow">I don't want to lose you.</font>

221
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,120
<font color="yellow">But if you stand...</font>

222
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,390
<font color="yellow">with your mum,</font>

223
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,990
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

224
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
<font color="yellow">no choice but to abandon you.</font>

225
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,160
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

226
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,550
<font color="yellow">Keep these words...</font>

227
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,160
<font color="yellow">in your mind.</font>

228
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,590
<font color="yellow">It's all for your sake.</font>

229
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,090
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

230
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,590
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I don't want to talk about it.</font>

231
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,990
<font color="yellow">Come on, tell us. What was this secret meeting about?</font>

232
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,120
<font color="yellow">Did he ask you to support him instead of me?</font>

233
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,890
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  What did you say?</font>

234
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,790
<font color="yellow">I really hate...</font>

235
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,950
<font color="yellow">how you two are fighting.</font>

236
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,420
<font color="yellow">I should just get married.</font>

237
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,120
<font color="yellow">- Shin Young. That little...
-  Mum, leave her alone.</font>

238
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,820
<font color="yellow">Shin Young's a simpleton, so I can talk to her later.</font>

239
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,020
<font color="yellow">What happened to Il Jae's support?</font>

240
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,950
<font color="yellow">He will abandon Gun Woo in no time.</font>

241
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,620
<font color="yellow">Trust me and don't worry about it.</font>

242
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,690
<font color="yellow">You've failed my trust so many times before.</font>

243
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,160
<font color="yellow">I'm... I'm... I'm serious this time around!</font>

244
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,590
<font color="yellow">Why do they all leave me?</font>

245
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
<font color="yellow">Anyways,</font>

246
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,160
<font color="yellow">I wonder what Soo Yeon's doing.</font>

247
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
<font color="yellow">(Oh Soo Yeon)</font>

248
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,420
<font color="yellow">Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system.</font>

249
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,590
<font color="yellow">Please leave your message after the beep.</font>

250
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,850
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo lost his sponsor...</font>

251
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,420
<font color="yellow">so he's as good as gone.</font>

252
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,990
<font color="yellow">It's time for me to talk Soo Yeon into this.</font>

253
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,160
<font color="yellow">Let's see. Chairman, where should I put this camera?</font>

254
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,490
<font color="yellow">Over here? No.</font>

255
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
<font color="yellow">How's this?</font>

256
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,160
<font color="yellow">- Give that to me.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

257
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,520
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

258
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,420
<font color="yellow">This is perfect. It's done.</font>

259
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,990
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chairman.</font>

260
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,850
<font color="yellow">Once I have the evidence,</font>

261
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,920
<font color="yellow">she will be charged...</font>

262
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,490
<font color="yellow">for attempted murder.</font>

263
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,390
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm on this blind date just for fun.</font>

264
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,020
<font color="yellow">It's Dodo Group's daughter.</font>

265
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,020
<font color="yellow">I heard she's crazy and that she's pretty dull.</font>

266
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,390
<font color="yellow">I heard she's insane.</font>

267
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,720
<font color="yellow">My gosh, Darling. Don't worry.</font>

268
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,520
<font color="yellow">You're the only one for me.</font>

269
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,250
<font color="yellow">(I love you, Darling.)</font>

270
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,550
<font color="yellow">Who is that guy?</font>

271
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,720
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  You're early, Mr Park.</font>

272
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,520
<font color="yellow">I just got here, too.</font>

273
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
<font color="yellow">He's not that bad.</font>

274
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,720
<font color="yellow">Say hello. This is Do Shin Young, my daughter.</font>

275
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,220
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you. I'm Do Shin Young.</font>

276
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,550
<font color="yellow">I'm Park Je Soo. Nice to meet you.</font>

277
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,490
<font color="yellow">Have a great time then.</font>

278
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,650
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Bye.</font>

279
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,320
<font color="yellow">Shall we go eat?</font>

280
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,090
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

281
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,720
<font color="yellow">What a great timing.</font>

282
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,390
<font color="yellow">This is my hotel, so I'll lead the way.</font>

283
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

284
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,020
<font color="yellow">Kang Ga Din, you're probably mad, aren't you?</font>

285
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,920
<font color="yellow">You should've been good to me while I was still around.</font>

286
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,490
<font color="yellow">This feels great.</font>

287
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,220
<font color="yellow">That's Gwangjin Shipping's Chairman, Mr Park's son.</font>

288
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
<font color="yellow">Gwangjin Shipping?</font>

289
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,520
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the company that's investing in us?</font>

290
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,290
<font color="yellow">You're right. He's the CEO of foreign division.</font>

291
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,420
<font color="yellow">He seems like a jerk.</font>

292
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

293
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,350
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat, too.</font>

294
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,320
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

295
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,390
<font color="yellow">I can't believe someone as beautiful as you are in hotel business.</font>

296
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
<font color="yellow">I'm impressed.</font>

297
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,720
<font color="yellow">You look like the type who'd be popular with girls.</font>

298
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,920
<font color="yellow">Everyone says that, but it's not true.</font>

299
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,850
<font color="yellow">I've been focused only on my work.</font>

300
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,290
<font color="yellow">So I haven't dated many women.</font>

301
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,290
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

302
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,590
<font color="yellow">You're just like me.</font>

303
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,390
<font color="yellow">(Assistant)</font>

304
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,420
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I have to take this.</font>

305
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,290
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

306
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,020
<font color="yellow">(My love, do not worry.)</font>

307
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,620
<font color="yellow">(Other than the fact that she's rich, she's nothing to you.)</font>

308
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,790
<font color="yellow">(She doesn't even know I'm talking about her. She's smiling.)</font>

309
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,520
<font color="yellow">(We'll use her just for business.)</font>

310
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,150
<font color="yellow">(Don't worry. I will never let you go.)</font>

311
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,490
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It was a business call from Spain.</font>

312
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,820
<font color="yellow">I'd like to get married right away...</font>

313
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,320
<font color="yellow">without an engagement period.</font>

314
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,420
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

315
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,720
<font color="yellow">(What a jerk.)</font>

316
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,890
<font color="yellow">(I lived in Spain for five years.)</font>

317
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,790
<font color="yellow">What did you say? "Just for business?"</font>

318
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,250
<font color="yellow">"I'll never let you go, so don't worry about that"?</font>

319
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,850
<font color="yellow">You're fluent in Spanish.</font>

320
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,520
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you lived there for five years.</font>

321
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,250
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Hey, Shin Young.</font>

322
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,690
<font color="yellow">Everyone in the business world knows that you're crazy.</font>

323
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,650
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can get married with that kind of personality?</font>

324
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,520
<font color="yellow">You're lucky it's me. At least I'm eating with you.</font>

325
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,690
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

326
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,790
<font color="yellow">Let her hand go.</font>

327
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,450
<font color="yellow">Are you Chairman Park of Gwangjin Shipping?</font>

328
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,190
<font color="yellow">This is Chairman K...</font>

329
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,190
<font color="yellow">of KT Corporation.</font>

330
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,020
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

331
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,720
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you. I'm Gwangjin Shipping's...</font>

332
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,150
<font color="yellow">Did you decline my proposal...</font>

333
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,490
<font color="yellow">for someone like him?</font>

334
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,990
<font color="yellow">Chairman K, you must be mistaken.</font>

335
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,090
<font color="yellow">Are we investing in Gwangjin Shipping?</font>

336
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,220
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  Cancel it.</font>

337
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,350
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

338
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,890
<font color="yellow">I won't forgive anyone...</font>

339
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,520
<font color="yellow">who treats Shin Young like this.</font>

340
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,150
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

341
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,720
<font color="yellow">Chairman K! I really didn't know! Sir!</font>

342
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,490
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll thank you if you do this?</font>

343
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,590
<font color="yellow">I can't bear to watch other people look down...</font>

344
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,890
<font color="yellow">on my business partner.</font>

345
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,450
<font color="yellow">Business partner?</font>

346
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

347
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,320
<font color="yellow">You will be doing business with me.</font>

348
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,850
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

349
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,720
<font color="yellow">When the shipowners come from China, I'll give them room...</font>

350
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,820
<font color="yellow">You can't call yourself a business partner with something like that.</font>

351
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,220
<font color="yellow">Then what are you thinking of?</font>

352
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,320
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to let your brothers take everything?</font>

353
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,450
<font color="yellow">When you mean business, do you mean...</font>

354
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,450
<font color="yellow">I plan on partnering with you.</font>

355
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,820
<font color="yellow">You should take part in fighting...</font>

356
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,390
<font color="yellow">for your father's company.</font>

357
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,090
<font color="yellow">Answer me. Are you going to accept my offer?</font>

358
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,250
<font color="yellow">I will. I'll do it no matter what.</font>

359
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,820
<font color="yellow">I'll listen to anything you say, Ga Din.</font>

360
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,290
<font color="yellow">Oh, Shin Young. Goodness, you.</font>

361
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,490
<font color="yellow">Hey, Shin Young.</font>

362
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,490
<font color="yellow">What is it? You don't want to?</font>

363
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,850
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

364
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,850
<font color="yellow">Forget it then.</font>

365
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,820
<font color="yellow">Wait, I'll do it.</font>

366
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,450
<font color="yellow">I'll become your business partner.</font>

367
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,650
<font color="yellow">Don't be so childish.</font>

368
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,690
<font color="yellow">You need to become more mature.</font>

369
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,050
<font color="yellow">I'm already...</font>

370
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,650
<font color="yellow">mature as I am right now.</font>

371
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,650
<font color="yellow">Not that kind of mature.</font>

372
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,120
<font color="yellow">You need to act like a businesswoman.</font>

373
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,690
<font color="yellow">That's the only way you'll get to work with me.</font>

374
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,350
<font color="yellow">Don't we need to have meetings if we're partners?</font>

375
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,690
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ga Din!</font>

376
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,690
<font color="yellow">- Good luck!
-  Good luck!</font>

377
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,590
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much.</font>

378
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,350
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Ma'am.
-  Hello.</font>

379
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,590
<font color="yellow">I, Il Jae, will make Seoul for our ordinary citizens.</font>

380
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,390
<font color="yellow">- Good luck.
-  Do you plan on seeing Mr Byun?</font>

381
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,050
<font color="yellow">If he kidnapped Soo Yeon,</font>

382
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,290
<font color="yellow">he must know that I had a change of heart.</font>

383
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,250
<font color="yellow">I, Il Jae, will make Seoul for our ordinary citizens.</font>

384
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,890
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  Thank you.</font>

385
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,690
<font color="yellow">- You must be hard at work.
-  Thank you.</font>

386
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,820
<font color="yellow">- Good luck.
-  Good luck.</font>

387
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,020
<font color="yellow">- Please vote for us.
-  Okay.</font>

388
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,550
<font color="yellow">Things seem to be hectic at the office, prior to the EGM.</font>

389
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,620
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon disappeared.</font>

390
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,720
<font color="yellow">She has gone missing.</font>

391
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,050
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

392
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,320
<font color="yellow">I remember clearly...</font>

393
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,250
<font color="yellow">that you said you would get rid of Soo Yeon...</font>

394
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,920
<font color="yellow">if I didn't.</font>

395
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,190
<font color="yellow">Do you think I killed her?</font>

396
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,920
<font color="yellow">I never said she died.</font>

397
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,890
<font color="yellow">I said she disappeared.</font>

398
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,420
<font color="yellow">What did you do to her?</font>

399
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,420
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything about it.</font>

400
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,950
<font color="yellow">However, you brought it onto yourself...</font>

401
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,590
<font color="yellow">if anything happens to her.</font>

402
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,590
<font color="yellow">It's because you didn't listen to me.</font>

403
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,350
<font color="yellow">You killed her yourself.</font>

404
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,390
<font color="yellow">I hope she never shows up again.</font>

405
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,520
<font color="yellow">That way, there's no reason for you to hate me...</font>

406
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,920
<font color="yellow">nor for me to be suspicious of you.</font>

407
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,320
<font color="yellow">If you didn't do anything to Soo Yeon,</font>

408
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,490
<font color="yellow">there's no reason for me to hate you.</font>

409
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,490
<font color="yellow">I swear to my mother's grave...</font>

410
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,220
<font color="yellow">that her disappearance has nothing to do with me.</font>

411
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,820
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

412
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,190
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

413
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,450
<font color="yellow">I'm not fighting desperately for this election...</font>

414
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,890
<font color="yellow">just for myself.</font>

415
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,720
<font color="yellow">Once I become the mayor, I'll use all my power...</font>

416
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,050
<font color="yellow">to help you.</font>

417
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,220
<font color="yellow">I didn't give up my trust in you.</font>

418
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,220
<font color="yellow">I just hope...</font>

419
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,950
<font color="yellow">you'll come back to your place soon.</font>

420
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,720
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

421
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,020
<font color="yellow">Through this election, our ill-fated relationship...</font>

422
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,490
<font color="yellow">will come to an end.</font>

423
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,250
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

424
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,650
<font color="yellow">What's with you again?</font>

425
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,120
<font color="yellow">Last night, he slept with the air conditioner on.</font>

426
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,820
<font color="yellow">He caught a cold.</font>

427
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,320
<font color="yellow">Even dogs don't get colds in the summer.</font>

428
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,490
<font color="yellow">You've become so weak.</font>

429
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,050
<font color="yellow">I think he should have some samgyetang to get better.</font>

430
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

431
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,150
<font color="yellow">I'm starving, let's go.</font>

432
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,620
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

433
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,050
<font color="yellow">We'll be back.</font>

434
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,690
<font color="yellow">It's so hot.</font>

435
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,490
<font color="yellow">Good work, Sir.</font>

436
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,350
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

437
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,050
<font color="yellow">she'll switch the pills?</font>

438
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,820
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she'll be anxious because of the EGM.</font>

439
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,790
<font color="yellow">You have my blood pressure medication in a safe place, right?</font>

440
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

441
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,320
<font color="yellow">I hope...</font>

442
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,690
<font color="yellow">she gets caught.</font>

443
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,190
<font color="yellow">What took you so long? I told you to hurry.</font>

444
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,050
<font color="yellow">I ran here as soon as I got your call.</font>

445
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,350
<font color="yellow">What about the pills?</font>

446
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,650
<font color="yellow">They're right here.</font>

447
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,290
<font color="yellow">- Are they supplements?
-  Yes, Ma'am.</font>

448
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,590
<font color="yellow">Go stand guard outside.</font>

449
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,620
<font color="yellow">Here. Play it.</font>

450
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

451
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,190
<font color="yellow">It's your wife.</font>

452
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,350
<font color="yellow">What took you so long? I told you to hurry.</font>

453
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,790
<font color="yellow">I ran here as soon as I got your call.</font>

454
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,890
<font color="yellow">- What about the pills?
-  They're right here.</font>

455
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,550
<font color="yellow">- Are they supplements?
-  Yes, Ma'am.</font>

456
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,990
<font color="yellow">Go stand guard outside.</font>

457
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,190
<font color="yellow">We got her.</font>

458
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,720
<font color="yellow">This is the evidence that she tried to kill me.</font>

459
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,990
<font color="yellow">What do you plan on doing now?</font>

460
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,120
<font color="yellow">I'll wait until the EGM.</font>

461
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,390
<font color="yellow">I'll pay her back in a bigger way.</font>

462
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,950
<font color="yellow">If that still doesn't make me feel any better,</font>

463
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,720
<font color="yellow">I'll send her to jail.</font>

464
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,120
<font color="yellow">Why are you distracting me?</font>

465
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,450
<font color="yellow">I came...</font>

466
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,590
<font color="yellow">to listen to your playing the piano.</font>

467
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,250
<font color="yellow">They say people change when they're about to die.</font>

468
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,390
<font color="yellow">You wanted to break this piano before.</font>

469
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,190
<font color="yellow">Like you said,</font>

470
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,190
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll live long.</font>

471
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,350
<font color="yellow">I want to ask...</font>

472
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,090
<font color="yellow">if you can give me...</font>

473
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,220
<font color="yellow">one last chance to sit at the chairman's chair...</font>

474
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,150
<font color="yellow">at the next EGM.</font>

475
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,720
<font color="yellow">Are you begging me?</font>

476
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,190
<font color="yellow">I put my entire life...</font>

477
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,990
<font color="yellow">into building this company.</font>

478
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,060
<font color="yellow">Please let me keep my dignity.</font>

479
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,820
<font color="yellow">What's with you? You're scaring me.</font>

480
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,920
<font color="yellow">You were the one...</font>

481
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,720
<font color="yellow">who declined my offer to reconcile.</font>

482
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,850
<font color="yellow">You were a lion all your life, so you can't pretend to be a cat...</font>

483
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,120
<font color="yellow">just because your teeth and nails are removed.</font>

484
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,090
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

485
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,450
<font color="yellow">Stop being a hypocrite and be yourself!</font>

486
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
<font color="yellow">I became...</font>

487
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,450
<font color="yellow">the worst woman in history all because of you.</font>

488
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,190
<font color="yellow">You can live the rest of your life like that.</font>

489
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,250
<font color="yellow">As the worst man in history.</font>

490
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

491
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

492
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,920
<font color="yellow">You will soon get to see...</font>

493
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,020
<font color="yellow">how bad I am, Gwi Ja.</font>

494
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,990
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

495
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,220
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hey, how have you been?</font>

496
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,590
<font color="yellow">Everything here would look great on Soo Yeon.</font>

497
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,790
<font color="yellow">I'll take everything here! Everything!</font>

498
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,390
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

499
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,890
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh probably has her taste. I don't think you should...</font>

500
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,820
<font color="yellow">I've never seen any woman who didn't like expensive things.</font>

501
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,220
<font color="yellow">Wait and see.</font>

502
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,320
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon will be mine soon.</font>

503
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,950
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you like her so much.</font>

504
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,560
<font color="yellow">You don't like someone for a reason.</font>

505
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,320
<font color="yellow">I just like her. That's a reason enough.</font>

506
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,690
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>

507
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,620
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon has a great relationship with Father.</font>

508
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,350
<font color="yellow">Once Soo Yeon likes me,</font>

509
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,560
<font color="yellow">I feel that my relationship with him would improve, too.</font>

510
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,920
<font color="yellow">I want to get along with him again like the times before.</font>

511
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,290
<font color="yellow">Have you ever been on good terms with him?</font>

512
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,450
<font color="yellow">It was probably back when I was about 12...</font>

513
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,390
<font color="yellow">or maybe 13.</font>

514
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,690
<font color="yellow">I got along with him until then.</font>

515
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,490
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

516
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,320
<font color="yellow">Anyways, Soo Yeon will be a lucky girl for me.</font>

517
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
<font color="yellow">You just wait and see.</font>

518
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,090
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

519
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,150
<font color="yellow">Hold this. Hold it.</font>

520
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,450
<font color="yellow">I'll put this on Soo Yeon and go abroad right away.</font>

521
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,690
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

522
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,120
<font color="yellow">(Huaping's hideout in China)</font>

523
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,490
<font color="yellow">I can't find anything in Il Jae's books.</font>

524
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,620
<font color="yellow">We should search harder. I'm sure he made a slush fund.</font>

525
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,520
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>

526
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,720
<font color="yellow">When Chairman was hit with that bullet,</font>

527
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,850
<font color="yellow">he stayed here in a vegetative state for a year.</font>

528
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
<font color="yellow">Chairman.</font>

529
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,490
<font color="yellow">What brings you here all of a sudden?</font>

530
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,620
<font color="yellow">I had to come for a discussion. I'm taking Lawyer Oh back tomorrow.</font>

531
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,790
<font color="yellow">Did you find everything okay?</font>

532
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,250
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

533
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,420
<font color="yellow">Boss is in Italy right now.</font>

534
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,620
<font color="yellow">I talked to him.</font>

535
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

536
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,020
<font color="yellow">Take him.</font>

537
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,190
<font color="yellow">What happened? I thought he couldn't come.</font>

538
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,060
<font color="yellow">He found new evidence of Il Jae's slush fund,</font>

539
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,650
<font color="yellow">so he changed his schedule.</font>

540
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,320
<font color="yellow">A paper company in Hong Kong is related to Il Jae.</font>

541
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,390
<font color="yellow">Did you give her the documents?</font>

542
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,720
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  I looked into it.</font>

543
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,190
<font color="yellow">Il Jae made an investment to that paper company.</font>

544
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,520
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we can find something from there.</font>

545
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,290
<font color="yellow">I heard you barely ate.</font>

546
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,450
<font color="yellow">You're probably sick of staying here.</font>

547
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,320
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go for a ride?</font>

548
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,090
<font color="yellow">There are great places around here.</font>

549
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,650
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll get going.</font>

550
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,190
<font color="yellow">Do understand.</font>

551
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,290
<font color="yellow">She's a little dry.</font>

552
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,620
<font color="yellow">I don't feel bad.</font>

553
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,220
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

554
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,020
<font color="yellow">She didn't make me feel bad.</font>

555
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,320
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

556
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,850
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lawyer Min.</font>

557
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

558
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,850
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo sent me presents?</font>

559
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,420
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

560
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,650
<font color="yellow">He sent you designer bags, shoes and clothes.</font>

561
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,590
<font color="yellow">My gosh, he even sent a swimsuit.</font>

562
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,590
<font color="yellow">Anyways, he sent a lot of stuff.</font>

563
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,790
<font color="yellow">How much do they add up to?</font>

564
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,020
<font color="yellow">Delivery!</font>

565
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,120
<font color="yellow">Here's another delivery.</font>

566
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,720
<font color="yellow">- Go and get that.
-  Delivery! Hurry!</font>

567
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,790
<font color="yellow">We're coming!</font>

568
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,290
<font color="yellow">You can open up a department store in here. What should I do?</font>

569
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,850
<font color="yellow">He must have no idea that I went missing.</font>

570
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,090
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't have sent these if he knew.</font>

571
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:03,450
<font color="yellow">He's such a fool.</font>

572
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,020
<font color="yellow">Leave them. I'll return them when I get there.</font>

573
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,220
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

574
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
<font color="yellow">Yes, Gun Woo.</font>

575
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,720
<font color="yellow">Are you doing okay over there?</font>

576
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,690
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm doing very well.</font>

577
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,290
<font color="yellow">I heard Gi Tan went there.</font>

578
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,850
<font color="yellow">Things are fine. Don't worry, Gun Woo.</font>

579
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,590
<font color="yellow">My father's looking for you.</font>

580
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,690
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you once you're back.</font>

581
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,120
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you tomorrow.</font>

582
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,090
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

583
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,090
<font color="yellow">What's she like?</font>

584
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,990
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

585
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,890
<font color="yellow">It seems like...</font>

586
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,320
<font color="yellow">both Gwang Woo and Gun Woo like her.</font>

587
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,690
<font color="yellow">She must be two-timing them.</font>

588
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,090
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

589
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,590
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

590
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,950
<font color="yellow">I think she's dating Gun Woo,</font>

591
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,090
<font color="yellow">but it seems like Gwang Woo is a one-sided thing.</font>

592
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,620
<font color="yellow">Whatever it is, she must be vulgar to let both brothers fall for her.</font>

593
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,090
<font color="yellow">Why are you smiling?</font>

594
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,450
<font color="yellow">Can't I smile?</font>

595
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,590
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason.</font>

596
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,350
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

597
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,420
<font color="yellow">Seeing Lawyer Oh makes me smile.</font>

598
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,350
<font color="yellow">I hope his hypnosis isn't getting undone.</font>

599
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,890
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look like it because he has no headaches.</font>

600
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,090
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin needs to find a way soon.</font>

601
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,450
<font color="yellow">Aren't you nervous...</font>

602
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,050
<font color="yellow">to see Gi Tan...</font>

603
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:58,990
<font color="yellow">around Lawyer Oh?</font>

604
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,620
<font color="yellow">I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.</font>

605
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,920
<font color="yellow">What do you like about her?</font>

606
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,550
<font color="yellow">Who on earth are you?</font>

607
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,850
<font color="yellow">Your mum will be okay.</font>

608
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,920
<font color="yellow">She really misses you, Ye Bin.</font>

609
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,390
<font color="yellow">You're such a good kid.</font>

610
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,520
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

611
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,190
<font color="yellow">Fine. You aren't good. You're really bad.</font>

612
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,720
<font color="yellow">Are you happy now?</font>

613
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,290
<font color="yellow">Is it that difficult to make an honest...</font>

614
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,920
<font color="yellow">and trustworthy company?</font>

615
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,850

<font color="yellow">The minute isn't up yet.</font>

770
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,220
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

771
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,920
<font color="yellow">Get some rest. Sweet dreams.</font>

772
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,450
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

773
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:02,650
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

774
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:07,850
<font color="yellow">I thought you went to bed. Why did you come back out?</font>

775
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:11,790
<font color="yellow">Well... I decided to have some fresh air instead.</font>

776
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,950
<font color="yellow">I should go to bed.</font>

777
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, you do that. Go on inside.</font>

778
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,720
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

779
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,390
<font color="yellow">What to do...</font>

780
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,520
<font color="yellow">You look upset.</font>

781
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,720
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

782
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,520
<font color="yellow">Il Jae, that fool...</font>

783
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,720
<font color="yellow">I think he and Chae Ryung...</font>

784
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,990
<font color="yellow">are having an affair.</font>

785
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,790
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

786
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:43,250
<font color="yellow">I just saw the two hugging each other.</font>

787
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:51,150
<font color="yellow">If he'd lost this election,</font>

788
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:55,320
<font color="yellow">I would have beaten him to a pulp.</font>

789
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,650
<font color="yellow">We have to pretend we don't know.</font>

790
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,150
<font color="yellow">He left his first wife...</font>

791
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,820
<font color="yellow">to date and then marry Ji Soo.</font>

792
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,320
<font color="yellow">I should have seen this coming.</font>

793
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,450
<font color="yellow">He's such a scoundrel.</font>

794
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,520
<font color="yellow">Oh dear...</font>

795
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,850
<font color="yellow">What's your schedule for the day?</font>

796
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:53,990
<font color="yellow">In the morning...</font>

797
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,590
<font color="yellow">In the morning, he will attend a service at the National Cemetery.</font>

798
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,720
<font color="yellow">In the afternoon, he'll give a talk to underprivileged children.</font>

799
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,150
<font color="yellow">You seem to know his entire schedule.</font>

800
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,190
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

801
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,990
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

802
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,090
<font color="yellow">This is bad.</font>

803
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:31,690
<font color="yellow">Turn on the television.</font>

804
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:34,150
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

805
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,220
<font color="yellow">Wait. What is he doing on television?</font>

806
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,490
<font color="yellow">You want to report someone for violating election laws.</font>

807
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,220
<font color="yellow">Yes. He currently has the highest support rating.</font>

808
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:51,590
<font color="yellow">It's Byun Il Jae.</font>

809
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,890
<font color="yellow">What is he talking about?</font>

810
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,550
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

811
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,020
<font color="yellow">They just issued a warrant for Il Jae's arrest.</font>

812
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:13,720
<font color="yellow">I should go...</font>

813
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,790
<font color="yellow">and congratulate him in person.</font>

814
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,850
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun promised me 2.5 million dollars.</font>

815
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,320
<font color="yellow">Would I quit campaigning for any less than that?</font>

816
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:32,720
<font color="yellow">I won't spend it for a while.</font>

817
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,390
<font color="yellow">I'll put it in a safe deposit box. Don't worry.</font>

818
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,990
<font color="yellow">Il Jae, Il Jae!</font>

819
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,050
<font color="yellow">I told you not to do something...</font>

820
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,420
<font color="yellow">My head hurts.</font>

821
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,290
<font color="yellow">Sir, you can't pass out.</font>

822
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:47,420
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

823
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,050
<font color="yellow">What a loser.</font>

824
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,050
<font color="yellow">My head...</font>

825
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:53,920
<font color="yellow">What would you like to say?</font>

826
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,190
<font color="yellow">By the time this airs,</font>

827
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,650
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun might be the new mayor of Seoul.</font>

828
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:03,850
<font color="yellow">What angers me...</font>

829
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,790
<font color="yellow">is that he sold his conscience and sense of justice...</font>

830
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,790
<font color="yellow">to deceive the whole city.</font>

831
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,650
<font color="yellow">Those of you watching...</font>

832
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,590
<font color="yellow">must not fall for it.</font>

833
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:16,690
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae...</font>

834
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,150
<font color="yellow">deceived us all.</font>

835
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,420
<font color="yellow">He is the worst fraud ever.</font>

836
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:24,990
<font color="yellow">You said that pretty nicely, Sir.</font>

837
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,620
<font color="yellow">You look good on TV, too.</font>

838
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,990
<font color="yellow">I will end by saying just one more thing.</font>

839
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:38,050
<font color="yellow">The poorest people on Earth...</font>

840
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:39,820
<font color="yellow">are those without a dream.</font>

841
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,390
<font color="yellow">Hang onto your dream...</font>

842
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:46,920
<font color="yellow">and you are already the richest person in the world.</font>

843
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,220
<font color="yellow">It was nice to meet you all.</font>

844
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,450
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  Thank you.</font>

845
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:58,050
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

846
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:01,720
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you.</font>

847
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,720
<font color="yellow">(Special Lecture by Mayoral Elect)</font>

848
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,190
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Uncle.</font>

849
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,490
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you in prison.</font>

850
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,920
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

851
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,090
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae.</font>

852
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,520
<font color="yellow">You're under arrest for violating election laws.</font>

853
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,590
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

854
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,920
<font color="yellow">This is the teaser.</font>

855
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,990
<font color="yellow">There's more to come.</font>

856
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:02,890
<font color="yellow">Murder, abduction, illegal slush funds and more.</font>
