<font color="yellow">I'd like to meet with the guest.</font>

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,180
<font color="yellow">Did you set an appointment?</font>

00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,870
<font color="yellow">No, she came to greet...</font>

<font color="yellow">He's not in. Please leave.</font>

8

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,800
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,900
<font color="yellow">They're making a fool out of me, right?</font>

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,410
<font color="yellow">Not necessarily. You didn't have an appointment.</font>

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,400
<font color="yellow">I wasted my time. They're totally making fun of me.</font>

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,200
<font color="yellow">Who is this K or whatever? What's so special about him...</font>

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,960
<font color="yellow">that even his guards are so rude?</font>

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,400
<font color="yellow">They'll hear you. Please lower your voice.</font>

19

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,270
<font color="yellow">Just show up to eat.</font>

22
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,960
<font color="yellow">We're in the negative again this month.</font>

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,400
<font color="yellow">I know. Stop with the money talk.</font>

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of it.</font>

25

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,440

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,970
<font color="yellow">The murderer is still out and about.</font>

46
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,100
<font color="yellow">The real murderer for that case is known as...</font>

47
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,830
<font color="yellow">someone named Cha Woo.</font>

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,150
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Who's Cha Woo?</font>

49
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,530
<font color="yellow">He's Jo Gi Ryang's man.</font>

50
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,530
<font color="yellow">He killed himself and left a note saying that he's the murderer.</font>

51
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,230
<font color="yellow">Did the police buy that?</font>

52
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,630
<font color="yellow">There is a witness...</font>

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,070
<font color="yellow">who saw him murder Professor Na on that day.</font>

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,770
<font color="yellow">That witness must be another one of Jo Gi Ryang's man.</font>

55
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

56
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,100
<font color="yellow">In other words, Gi Ryang framed...</font>

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,170
<font color="yellow">the deceased Cha Woo with that murder...</font>

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,600
<font color="yellow">and saved Gi Tan.</font>

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,900
<font color="yellow">Why didn't he hide himself?</font>

60
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,630
<font color="yellow">Why did he show himself to us?</font>

61
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,800
<font color="yellow">It's a declaration of war.</font>

62
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,970
<font color="yellow">His tactics did not work thus far,</font>

63
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,330
<font color="yellow">so he's going into a full-scale war.</font>

64
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,900
<font color="yellow">What should we do? Now that he's free,</font>

65
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,870
<font color="yellow">he'll become more evil.</font>

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,630
<font color="yellow">Even sharks are...</font>

67
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,830
<font color="yellow">merely fish once they're on land.</font>

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,730
<font color="yellow">I don't care if he has Gi Ryang on his side.</font>

69
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,030
<font color="yellow">This is Korea.</font>

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,570
<font color="yellow">He is completely misled into thinking...</font>

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,570
<font color="yellow">that he can win a full-scale war in Korea.</font>

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,700
<font color="yellow">My thoughts are just like yours, Father.</font>

73
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,330
<font color="yellow">But the fact that he appeared right before the elections...</font>

74
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,130
<font color="yellow">concerns me.</font>

75
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,830
<font color="yellow">He probably...</font>

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,930
<font color="yellow">can't do much.</font>

77
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,670
<font color="yellow">Be thoroughly prepared.</font>

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,300

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,970
<font color="yellow">She seems very suspicious.</font>

84

<font color="yellow">She can never betray...</font>

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,670
<font color="yellow">This is a copy of her mobile.</font>

87
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,830
<font color="yellow">If she has betrayed you, she'll get a call from Il Jae.</font>

88
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,230
<font color="yellow">Is it because he knows about me now?</font>

89
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,460
<font color="yellow">When did you do that?</font>

90
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,270
<font color="yellow">Did you forget? I'm with the government.</font>

91
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,800
<font color="yellow">Her number has changed, so he may not know about it yet.</font>

92
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
<font color="yellow">I will make sure he gets her number.</font>

93
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,700
<font color="yellow">What? Did that K guy decline my invitation?</font>

94
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,530
<font color="yellow">Not only that. He wants to call his own chef...</font>

95
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,140
<font color="yellow">instead of eating the hotel's food.</font>

96
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,140
<font color="yellow">He's treating us as if we are a cheap motel.</font>

97
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,130
<font color="yellow">Did you tell him about me?</font>

98
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,300
<font color="yellow">He's a businessman. Of course he'd know about you.</font>

99
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,070
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that he did this knowing who I was?</font>

100
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,370
<font color="yellow">What does he look like?</font>

101
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,770
<font color="yellow">He's very tall and handsome.</font>

102
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,980
<font color="yellow">- Isn't he an old man?
-  He was young.</font>

103

<font color="yellow">My goodness. That's worse.</font>

104
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,330
<font color="yellow">He's just showing off.</font>

105
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,470

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,270
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak, will you come with me?</font>

158
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,430
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

159
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,530
<font color="yellow">I heard about you.</font>

160
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,970
<font color="yellow">You were fired by Gwang Woo and got a divorce, too.</font>

161
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
<font color="yellow">I'm the bad guy.</font>

162
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,200
<font color="yellow">I always made excuses that I was busy working.</font>

163
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,830
<font color="yellow">And now,</font>

164
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,900
<font color="yellow">I can't even be a father.</font>

165
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,770
<font color="yellow">Can you help out with my business?</font>

166
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,130
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

167
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,970
<font color="yellow">Legally speaking, it's about making investments...</font>

168
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,800
<font color="yellow">and signing contracts with ships from China.</font>

169
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,570
<font color="yellow">What's the illegal part?</font>

170
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,530
<font color="yellow">Getting my revenge...</font>

171
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,470
<font color="yellow">at Il Jae and Gwang Woo.</font>

172
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,100
<font color="yellow">(Account Book)</font>

173
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,430
<font color="yellow">This is your front money.</font>

174
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,800
<font color="yellow">Three million dollars?</font>

175
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,570
<font color="yellow">You can clear your debt...</font>

176
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,770
<font color="yellow">and take care of your family.</font>

177
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,170
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

178
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,530
<font color="yellow">choose me?</font>

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,100
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

180
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,130
<font color="yellow">the best in Korea.</font>

181
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,600
<font color="yellow">You can get your revenge on Gwang Woo.</font>

182
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,670
<font color="yellow">You're the best partner for me.</font>

183
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,200
<font color="yellow">I don't fire people like Dodo Group does.</font>

184
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,300
<font color="yellow">You'll stay with me to the end.</font>

185
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,330
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Gi Tan.</font>

186
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,500
<font color="yellow">You have saved my family.</font>

187
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,230
<font color="yellow">I owe my life to you.</font>

188
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,000
<font color="yellow">Do we have a deal?</font>

189
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,900
<font color="yellow">I will do my best.</font>

190
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,070
<font color="yellow">I will be loyal.</font>

191
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,330
<font color="yellow">From now on, I will call you Chairman.</font>

192
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,270
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Gi Tan. Thank you.</font>

193
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,800
<font color="yellow">Does that mean he doesn't remember Soo Yeon?</font>

194
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,230
<font color="yellow">He has a bullet in his head.</font>

195
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,600
<font color="yellow">If you force him to remember, it may endanger his life.</font>

196
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,570
<font color="yellow">So don't ever mention Soo Yeon's name.</font>

197
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,770
<font color="yellow">Also, don't tell her about him either.</font>

198
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,570
<font color="yellow">Poor Soo Yeon.</font>

199
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,570
<font color="yellow">She's working so hard to take revenge for him.</font>

200
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,200
<font color="yellow">Please review it just once.</font>

201
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,690
<font color="yellow">That's not too much to ask.</font>

202
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,270
<font color="yellow">You're so persistent.</font>

203
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,200
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

204
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,230
<font color="yellow">Leave it.</font>

205
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,870
<font color="yellow">You want me to review it?</font>

206
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,970
<font color="yellow">Here. I reviewed it.</font>

207
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,130
<font color="yellow">Happy?</font>

208
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,070
<font color="yellow">You're not the only stubborn one.</font>

209
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,830
<font color="yellow">You should give up.</font>

210
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,430
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Why are you eating this...</font>

211
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,030
<font color="yellow">alone?</font>

212
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,000
<font color="yellow">I'm stressed.</font>

213
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,490
<font color="yellow">If you're not here to eat, can you leave me alone?</font>

214
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,700
<font color="yellow">How is that? Is it tasty?</font>

215
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,970
<font color="yellow">Why would I pay for something that tastes bad?</font>

216
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,830
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo trampled over you,</font>

217
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,770
<font color="yellow">but you seem to be doing fine.</font>

218
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,230
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

219
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,930
<font color="yellow">You have a beautiful neck.</font>

220
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,000
<font color="yellow">It's so slender.</font>

221
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,240
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be sued for sexual harassment?</font>

222
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,300
<font color="yellow">You're so charming.</font>

223
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,200
<font color="yellow">I love girls who play hard to get.</font>

224
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,400
<font color="yellow">Other girls can't act like you in front of me.</font>

225
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,870
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

226
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,470
<font color="yellow">How can a girl not have a single necklace?</font>

227
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,530
<font color="yellow">Bring me that long and beautiful neck close.</font>

228
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,800
<font color="yellow">I hate people like you.</font>

229
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

230
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,730
<font color="yellow">No woman has ever rejected me.</font>

231
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,030
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to make me antsy?</font>

232
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,430
<font color="yellow">You disgust me.</font>

233
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,330
<font color="yellow">You're such a player.</font>

234
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,130
<font color="yellow">You know how to play with people's hearts.</font>

235
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,120
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

236
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,170
<font color="yellow">I hear you're enemies with Il Jae.</font>

237
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,000
<font color="yellow">What do you think about holding hands?</font>

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,400
<font color="yellow">I want to kill him, too.</font>

239
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,130
<font color="yellow">He scammed me for the year long contract.</font>

240
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,000
<font color="yellow">He made a fool out of me.</font>

241
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,570
<font color="yellow">Il Jae and Gun Woo are on the same side.</font>

242
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,140
<font color="yellow">- I know.
-  How can you act like that...</font>

243
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,770
<font color="yellow">if you already know?</font>

244
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,880
<font color="yellow">You and I should partner up if you want to pay Il Jae back.</font>

245
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,400
<font color="yellow">I pick and choose my people...</font>

246
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,970
<font color="yellow">between those I can trust and those I cannot.</font>

247
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,770
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can trust Gun Woo...</font>

248
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,800
<font color="yellow">and not me?</font>

249
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,000
<font color="yellow">You have it all wrong.</font>

250
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,530
<font color="yellow">You can't trust anyone in this world.</font>

251
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,270
<font color="yellow">What matters is if your goals align.</font>

252
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,770
<font color="yellow">Be simple. Don't make it so complicated.</font>

253
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,100
<font color="yellow">If you want to become our legal counsel,</font>

254
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,730
<font color="yellow">come to the underground bar in Hangang Hotel by 9pm tonight.</font>

255
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,930
<font color="yellow">If you miss this chance,</font>

256
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,330
<font color="yellow">you won't ever get your revenge on Il Jae.</font>

257
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,330
<font color="yellow">And I won't ever...</font>

258
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,330
<font color="yellow">reach out to you again either.</font>

259
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,320
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kang says he's running late due to traffic.</font>

260
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,300
<font color="yellow">Okay. Get me a drink.</font>

261
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,300
<font color="yellow">It's Soo Yeon.</font>

262
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,030
<font color="yellow">Call Lawyer Kang and change our meeting location.</font>

263
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,500
<font color="yellow">You made the right decision.</font>

264
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,330
<font color="yellow">I was afraid you might not show up.</font>

265
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,130
<font color="yellow">Can you promise me the legal counsel position?</font>

266
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,130
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

267
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,520
<font color="yellow">I always keep my promises.</font>

268
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,570
<font color="yellow">Especially the ones...</font>

269
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,500
<font color="yellow">with women.</font>

270
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,900
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

271
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,600
<font color="yellow">Don't act so innocent.</font>

272
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,230
<font color="yellow">Didn't you expect this on your way here?</font>

273
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,000
<font color="yellow">We already have someone picked out for that role.</font>

274
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
<font color="yellow">We'll have to kick him out before giving it to you.</font>

275
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,730
<font color="yellow">A promise won't cut it.</font>

276
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,800
<font color="yellow">You and I really have to be on the same side.</font>

277
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,970
<font color="yellow">Watch it.</font>

278
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,330
<font color="yellow">I want you...</font>

279
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,300
<font color="yellow">to be my girl.</font>

280
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,330
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting for you.</font>

281
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,330
<font color="yellow">Cancel my meeting...</font>

282
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,970
<font color="yellow">with Lawyer Kang.</font>

283
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,730
<font color="yellow">That jerk...</font>

284
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,870
<font color="yellow">What does he take me for?</font>

285
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,030
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

286
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,800
<font color="yellow">Is this how low you've become?</font>

287
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,760
<font color="yellow">Low?</font>

288
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,530
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what Gwang Woo is like?</font>

289
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,970
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

290
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,000
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Do you know how my brother died?</font>

291
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,900
<font color="yellow">Do you even know how I feel?</font>

292
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,270
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

293
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,700
<font color="yellow">I can do much worse...</font>

294
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,030
<font color="yellow">than what you're thinking.</font>

295
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,700
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I won't do.</font>

296
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,000
<font color="yellow">Here's my secret weapon.</font>

297
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,570
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

298
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,830
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

299
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

300
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,270
<font color="yellow">I already gave you the key.</font>

301
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,570
<font color="yellow">Why are you ringing the bell?</font>

302
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,440
<font color="yellow">You're getting me excited.</font>

303
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,470
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

304
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,300
<font color="yellow">Hey. What is this about?</font>

305
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,300
<font color="yellow">How did you...</font>

306
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,700
<font color="yellow">How dare you? You little...</font>

307
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,250
<font color="yellow">You should know your place. Why do you keep bothering me?</font>

308
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,020
<font color="yellow">Hey! Is this about Soo Yeon?</font>

309
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,860
<font color="yellow">You're an animal.</font>

310
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,960
<font color="yellow">What does it have to do with you?</font>

311
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,870
<font color="yellow">Are you her boyfriend?</font>

312
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,940
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth!</font>

313
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,130
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

314
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,530
<font color="yellow">Sir, please calm down.</font>

315
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,970
<font color="yellow">Are you serious? Take this!</font>

316
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

317
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,970
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

318
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,370
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

319
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,530
<font color="yellow">I'll get you.</font>

320
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

321
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,070
<font color="yellow">I'm fine, don't worry.</font>

322
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,140
<font color="yellow">Tell the board members that we'll go with Soo Yeon...</font>

323
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,440
<font color="yellow">as our legal counsel.</font>

324
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry?</font>

325
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,130
<font color="yellow">Kang Ga Din?</font>

326
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,230
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

327
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,500
<font color="yellow">It can't be. He's dead.</font>

328
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,100
<font color="yellow">But he looks so much like him.</font>

329
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,800
<font color="yellow">Shin Young is following you.</font>

330
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,030
<font color="yellow">That's annoying. Let's speed up.</font>

331
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,970
<font color="yellow">- Follow them.
-  What?</font>

332
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,170
<font color="yellow">- Find out where they're going.
-  Yes.</font>

333
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,300
<font color="yellow">It can't be Ga Din.</font>

334
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,000
<font color="yellow">I've been working too much. I must be seeing things.</font>

335
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,730
<font color="yellow">Was Shin Young the woman I liked...</font>

336
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,730
<font color="yellow">- by any chance?
-  Why?</font>

337
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,930
<font color="yellow">Did your heart ache?</font>

338
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
<font color="yellow">It always aches.</font>

339
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,730
<font color="yellow">It feels as if I have a hole in my heart.</font>

340
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,530
<font color="yellow">There were rumours that Do Choong wanted you as his son-in-law.</font>

341
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,800
<font color="yellow">Then is it really her?</font>

342
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,690
<font color="yellow">You also know that she's a little princess.</font>

343
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,970
<font color="yellow">I know that very well. I was her personal assistant.</font>

344
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,260
<font color="yellow">Can you like her?</font>

345
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,370
<font color="yellow">I don't know many women.</font>

346
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,570
<font color="yellow">It's either you or Shin Young.</font>

347
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,530
<font color="yellow">You never know. You may have liked her without anyone's knowing.</font>

348
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,300
<font color="yellow">That'll be troublesome.</font>

349
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,360
<font color="yellow">I must've been crazy.</font>

350
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,970
<font color="yellow">You don't know this for sure.</font>

351
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,730
<font color="yellow">No, I can tell by the way she chased after me.</font>

352
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,130
<font color="yellow">There must be something here.</font>

353
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,270
<font color="yellow">- Did you lose him?
-  I'm sorry.</font>

354
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,200
<font color="yellow">It's nothing to be sorry about. I must be seeing things.</font>

355
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,470
<font color="yellow">Anyways, what happened with the dinner invitation?</font>

356
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,170
<font color="yellow">- He declined it.
-  Again?</font>

357
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,210
<font color="yellow">He's insane, isn't he?</font>

358
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,970
<font color="yellow">I think you should give up.</font>

359
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,600
<font color="yellow">It looks like he's playing hard to get.</font>

360
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,670
<font color="yellow">There are 3 strong candidates and 5 weak ones.</font>

361
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,970
<font color="yellow">The ruling party, opposing party and Il Jae are strong candidates.</font>

362
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,830
<font color="yellow">Other five candidates are classified as weak candidates.</font>

363
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,430
<font color="yellow">Is there a chance for Il Jae to be elected?</font>

364
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,170
<font color="yellow">Experts believe...</font>

365
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,970
<font color="yellow">he'll become the strongest candidate at the end of this month.</font>

366
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,240
<font color="yellow">In that case,</font>

367
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,770
<font color="yellow">we should move before then.</font>

368
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,370
<font color="yellow">Is there anything you thought of?</font>

369
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,370
<font color="yellow">There is no one in Korea...</font>

370
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,500
<font color="yellow">who knows more about Il Jae's weaknesses than me.</font>

371
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,530
<font color="yellow">Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice...</font>

372
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,470
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's Chae Ryung's number?</font>

373
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,100
<font color="yellow">I went and asked a staff of her gallery myself.</font>

374
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,370
<font color="yellow">If you need to take it, you can go outside.</font>

375
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

376
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,970
<font color="yellow">It's me, Il Jae.</font>

377
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,970
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

378
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,930
<font color="yellow">I was overseas.</font>

379
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,300
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan is alive.</font>

380
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,480
<font color="yellow">Did you know?</font>

381
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,970
<font color="yellow">No, I've been away from everyone. I didn't know.</font>

382
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,670
<font color="yellow">If you are lying because of your loyalty,</font>

383
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,500
<font color="yellow">you will pay for it.</font>

384
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,370
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying.</font>

385
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,670
<font color="yellow">I really didn't know.</font>

386
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,530
<font color="yellow">We did not get a patent in China with our new medicine.</font>

387
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,970
<font color="yellow">Is this because of Jo Gi Ryang?</font>

388
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,680
<font color="yellow">It probably is.</font>

389
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,300
<font color="yellow">He has connections with many high-profile people in China.</font>

390
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,130
<font color="yellow">We have much to discuss. Let's meet right now.</font>

391
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,130
<font color="yellow">We'll take you.</font>

392
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,370
<font color="yellow">Okay, Father.</font>

393
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,600
<font color="yellow">- What did he say?
-  There are no exceptions.</font>

394
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,700
<font color="yellow">We will move according to our rules.</font>

395
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,700
<font color="yellow">What is that rule?</font>

396
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,000
<font color="yellow">She'll be eliminated.</font>

397
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,730
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, can you do it?</font>

398
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,970
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung's life has been taken away...</font>

399
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,230
<font color="yellow">the moment Boss wanted her dead.</font>

400
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,700
<font color="yellow">- How can you kill a person?
-  If not, I'll get killed.</font>

401
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,600
<font color="yellow">- Where's Chae Ryung?
-  She's inside.</font>

402
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,370
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of her.</font>

403
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,930
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

404
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,830
<font color="yellow">Unlike anyone else,</font>

405
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,100
<font color="yellow">I trusted you.</font>

406
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,570
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

407
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,970
<font color="yellow">Are you going to kill me?</font>

408
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,370
<font color="yellow">It's our rule.</font>

409
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,530
<font color="yellow">You know it better than I do.</font>

410
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,470
<font color="yellow">I won't beg for my life.</font>

411
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,930
<font color="yellow">I know I'll die, anyways.</font>

412
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,970
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one thing.</font>

413
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,900
<font color="yellow">Why did you shoot Boss, not me?</font>

414
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,230
<font color="yellow">If Il Jae wanted someone dead,</font>

415
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,570
<font color="yellow">it should've been me.</font>

416
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,700
<font color="yellow">But you shot Boss.</font>

417
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,770
<font color="yellow">I only stepped in.</font>

418
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,730
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

419
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,930
<font color="yellow">How could I kill you?</font>

420
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,530
<font color="yellow">I can't kill you.</font>

421
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,100
<font color="yellow">That's why I killed Cha Woo.</font>

422
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,730
<font color="yellow">He wanted to blow up the car you were in.</font>

423
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,800
<font color="yellow">I brought this upon myself. I have no regrets.</font>

424
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,670
<font color="yellow">Kill me. If not, you'll die.</font>

425
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,170
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

426
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,330
<font color="yellow">If I don't kill you, I'll die.</font>

427
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,130
<font color="yellow">I liked you a lot.</font>

428
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,570
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved to know...</font>

429
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,530
<font color="yellow">that I can die in your hands.</font>

430
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

431
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,770
<font color="yellow">Take care of her body.</font>

432
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,370
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

433
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,870
<font color="yellow">- Everyone can go.
-  Yes, Chairman.</font>

434
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,200
<font color="yellow">- Everyone, leave.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

435
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,000
<font color="yellow">Stay here just in case anything happens.</font>

436
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,270
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

437
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,500
<font color="yellow">Ok Chae Ryung is officially deceased.</font>

438
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,170
<font color="yellow">If anyone finds out you're alive, Chairman will die. Understood?</font>

439
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,900
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

440
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,090
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

441
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,100
<font color="yellow">Il Jae.</font>

442
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,100
<font color="yellow">He thinks I'm on his team.</font>

443
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,530
<font color="yellow">I will leave,</font>

444
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,200
<font color="yellow">but I don't want to remain as a traitor to Gi Tan.</font>

445
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,700
<font color="yellow">Will you be a double agent?</font>

446
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,930
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

447
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,070
<font color="yellow">This isn't for me to decide.</font>

448
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,230
<font color="yellow">- Chairman will need to approve...
-  He won't approve of it.</font>

449
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,900
<font color="yellow">He said he'll never see me again.</font>

450
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,570
<font color="yellow">When I get any results from working as a double agent,</font>

451
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,930
<font color="yellow">you can tell Gi Tan at that time.</font>

452
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,930
<font color="yellow">Until then, I'll only contact you.</font>

453
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,200
<font color="yellow">From now on, Mr Gong...</font>

454
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,600
<font color="yellow">will be the only one taking care of my husband.</font>

455
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,630
<font color="yellow">Mrs Do, what do you mean?</font>

456
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,470
<font color="yellow">"Mrs Do"?</font>

457
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,670
<font color="yellow">I'm the chairwoman.</font>

458
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,130
<font color="yellow">Starting with his meals, laundry and other housework,</font>

459
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,840
<font color="yellow">I want you to take care of him by yourself.</font>

460
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,800
<font color="yellow">Do you want to ostracise him?</font>

461
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,970
<font color="yellow">I never said such a thing.</font>

462
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,230
<font color="yellow">I asked you to take care of him.</font>

463
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,200
<font color="yellow">You know how difficult it'll be for him.</font>

464
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,570
<font color="yellow">If you're not confident, you can go to the nursing home with him.</font>

465
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,200
<font color="yellow">Why do you persist on staying in this house?</font>

466
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,170
<font color="yellow">- Mrs Do...
-  Chairwoman!</font>

467
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,870
<font color="yellow">If you're still displeased, you can leave for good.</font>

468
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,630
<font color="yellow">I'll give you enough severance pay for you to live off of.</font>

469
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,770
<font color="yellow">I can't leave...</font>

470
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,650
<font color="yellow">without him.</font>

471
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,630
<font color="yellow">Then keep your mouth shut!</font>

472
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,400
<font color="yellow">You all heard me, right?</font>

473
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,930
<font color="yellow">Starting today,</font>

474
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,370
<font color="yellow">I'll fire anyone...</font>

475
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,570
<font color="yellow">who tries to take care of my husband.</font>

476
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,200
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

477
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,300
<font color="yellow">You think that it's normal for me to sacrifice for you.</font>

478
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,030
<font color="yellow">I want you to experience how I felt.</font>

479
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,070
<font color="yellow">That's the only way you'll understand.</font>

480
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,170
<font color="yellow">You're narrow-minded and evil.</font>

481
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,940
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

482
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,570
<font color="yellow">I'm narrow-minded and evil.</font>

483
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,730
<font color="yellow">People say that you reap what you sow.</font>

484
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,130
<font color="yellow">You were always so dignified in front of me.</font>

485
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,100
<font color="yellow">You'd have an affair and bring in an illegitimate child.</font>

486
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,470
<font color="yellow">You'd treat me harshly in front of others, and it was nothing to you.</font>

487
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,170
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do the same.</font>

488
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,470
<font color="yellow">I'll be confident and dignified.</font>

489
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,600
<font color="yellow">If you're being like this,</font>

490
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,130
<font color="yellow">I won't give Gwang Woo or Shin Young...</font>

491
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,970
<font color="yellow">any of my inheritance.</font>

492
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,470
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm just a housewife?</font>

493
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,820
<font color="yellow">Do you think I didn't do my research on your inheritance?</font>

494
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,970
<font color="yellow">Even if you write a will,</font>

495
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,470
<font color="yellow">half of what you own is legally ours!</font>

496
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,000
<font color="yellow">It's called legitim.</font>

497
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,670
<font color="yellow">Poor you.</font>

498
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,700
<font color="yellow">You ran out of things you can threaten me with.</font>

499
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,030
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

500
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,230
<font color="yellow">What will you do...</font>

501
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,170
<font color="yellow">if I get back on my feet?</font>

502
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,110
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that you might actually die like this.</font>

503
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,300
<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry for you.</font>

504
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,130
<font color="yellow">Take this...</font>

505
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,230
<font color="yellow">and live a long life.</font>

506
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,370
<font color="yellow">You can't die so soon.</font>

507
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,800
<font color="yellow">I suffered for too long.</font>

508
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,430
<font color="yellow">I haven't cooked for so long.</font>

509
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,430
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure how it'll taste.</font>

510
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,650
<font color="yellow">You should eat with me.</font>

511
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,900
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. You go ahead.</font>

512
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,730
<font color="yellow">I feel lonely, that's why.</font>

513
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,030
<font color="yellow">Come and eat with me.</font>

514
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,800
<font color="yellow">All right, Sir.</font>

515
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,970
<font color="yellow">Doenjang jjigae?</font>

516
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,970
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

517
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,130
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

518
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,500
<font color="yellow">Does it taste bad?</font>

519
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

520
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,230
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

521
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,430
<font color="yellow">What do you think about leaving this place for a home?</font>

522
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
<font color="yellow">Sir?</font>

523
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,340
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

524
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,530
<font color="yellow">You remember, don't you?</font>

525
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,000
<font color="yellow">A lot of people...</font>

526
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,600
<font color="yellow">tried to pull me down until now.</font>

527
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,440
<font color="yellow">Samgong Group's Chairman Oh.</font>

528
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,200
<font color="yellow">Daehan Group's Chairman Park.</font>

529
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,400
<font color="yellow">Prime Minister Kim Oh Joong.</font>

530
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,430
<font color="yellow">Governor Ahn Goo Cheol.</font>

531
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,730
<font color="yellow">They all ended up...</font>

532
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,840
<font color="yellow">crawling back to me and begging.</font>

533
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,300
<font color="yellow">That's the kind of person I was.</font>

534
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,010
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

535
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,030
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

536
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,700
<font color="yellow">the woman I looked down the most...</font>

537
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,630
<font color="yellow">turned me into this.</font>

538
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,000
<font color="yellow">Everyone was scared of Do Choong.</font>

539
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,030
<font color="yellow">But she turned me...</font>

540
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,770
<font color="yellow">into this shabby...</font>

541
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,930
<font color="yellow">and pathetic man.</font>

542
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,630
<font color="yellow">"I lived in Seoul for over 50 years."</font>

543
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,370
<font color="yellow">"When I was young, I lived in Ttukbang looking over..."</font>

544
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,400
<font color="yellow">"In my 20s, I lived in Mapo, looking over Han River."</font>

545
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,070
<font color="yellow">"Now, I'm near Mount Namsan..."</font>

546
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,710
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

547
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,770
<font color="yellow">It's me, Chae Ryung.</font>

548
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,420
<font color="yellow">What happened that day?</font>

549
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,030
<font color="yellow">I'm being changed by Huaping.</font>

550
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,310
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

551
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,760
<font color="yellow">I'll send a car to you. Come to my house.</font>

552
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,930
<font color="yellow">That'll be the safest.</font>

553
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,070
<font color="yellow">Are you better now?</font>

554
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,500
<font color="yellow">Yes. Thank you.</font>

555
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,270
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan...</font>

556
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,900
<font color="yellow">was trying to kill you?</font>

557
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,230
<font color="yellow">Yes. He found out that I was on your side.</font>

558
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,120
<font color="yellow">Where is he now?</font>

559
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,100
<font color="yellow">He's staying at Dodo Hotel.</font>

560
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,940
<font color="yellow">But the security is really tight.</font>

561
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,370
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard to approach him.</font>

562
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,200
<font color="yellow">Do you know his plans?</font>

563
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,470
<font color="yellow">I know that his first plan is to make sure that Mr Byun...</font>

564
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,000
<font color="yellow">doesn't get elected as Seoul's mayor.</font>

565
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,400
<font color="yellow">It's just as we anticipated.</font>

566
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,730
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

567
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,030
<font color="yellow">how does he plan on doing that?</font>

568
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,230
<font color="yellow">I don't know the details.</font>

569
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,600
<font color="yellow">I know someone close to Gi Tan, so I'll find out.</font>

570
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,670
<font color="yellow">You're going to help us?</font>

571
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,970
<font color="yellow">Unless Gi Tan disappears,</font>

572
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,100
<font color="yellow">I'll have to live the rest of my life on the run.</font>

573
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,370
<font color="yellow">Please let me help you.</font>

574
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,860
<font color="yellow">If you come to our side,</font>

575
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,770
<font color="yellow">we couldn't ask for any more.</font>

576
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,130
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

577
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,840
<font color="yellow">If you need a place to hide, you can stay here.</font>

578
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,130
<font color="yellow">Really? Can I do that?</font>

579
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,370
<font color="yellow">We're family now.</font>

580
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,930
<font color="yellow">We'll help each other out.</font>

581
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,700
<font color="yellow">Is that okay with you, Honey?</font>

582
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,100
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's fine with me.</font>

583
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,030
<font color="yellow">I should get my belongings from where I was staying.</font>

584
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,070
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun, will you come with me?</font>

585
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,180
<font color="yellow">Sure. Get the car ready.</font>

586
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,200
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir.</font>

587
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

588
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,290
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking inviting her to stay here?</font>

589
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,300
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

590
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,870
<font color="yellow">Are you suspicious of her?</font>

591
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,400
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't trust anyone yet.</font>

592
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,030
<font color="yellow">(Yeom Hyeong Gu)</font>

593
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,840
<font color="yellow">Well?</font>

594
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,830
<font color="yellow">Did you find out anything?</font>

595
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,770
<font color="yellow">I talked to the Chinese side,</font>

596
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,700
<font color="yellow">and it's true that Gi Ryang ordered Chae Ryung...</font>

597
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
<font color="yellow">to be killed.</font>

598
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,100
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan found out that Chae Ryung betrayed them.</font>

599
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,970
<font color="yellow">Following their rules,</font>

600
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,070
<font color="yellow">he decided to kill her.</font>

601
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,400
<font color="yellow">Make sure...</font>

602
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,370
<font color="yellow">no one finds out about her staying at my house.</font>

603
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,300
<font color="yellow">Her life's at stake.</font>

604
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,840
<font color="yellow">Yes. All right.</font>

605
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,300
<font color="yellow">I don't think we have to be...</font>

606
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,570
<font color="yellow">so suspicious of her at the moment.</font>

607
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,840
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

608
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

609
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,500
<font color="yellow">You've had enough to drink.</font>

610
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,170
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can sleep unless I'm drunk.</font>

611
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,840
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan aimed a gun at my head and...</font>

612
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,430
<font color="yellow">You don't know how that feels unless you've experienced it.</font>

613
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,430
<font color="yellow">You're softer than I thought.</font>

614
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,270
<font color="yellow">What did you think I was like?</font>

615
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,070
<font color="yellow">Cold, strong and haughty.</font>

616
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,840
<font color="yellow">No compassion at all.</font>

617
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,770
<font color="yellow">I thought I was like that, too.</font>

618
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,340
<font color="yellow">But it was all a mask.</font>

619
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,970
<font color="yellow">I was trained by the Huaping.</font>

620
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,070
<font color="yellow">That wasn't the real me.</font>

621
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,400
<font color="yellow">I lived a fake life.</font>

622
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,100
<font color="yellow">I left Huaping because I was sick of it.</font>

623
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,030
<font color="yellow">Now, I don't know what I should do.</font>

624
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,170
<font color="yellow">Be strong.</font>

625
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,930
<font color="yellow">Everyone goes about life...</font>

626
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,430
<font color="yellow">with a hint of lie.</font>

627
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,630
<font color="yellow">And saints are of no exception.</font>

628
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,770
<font color="yellow">That is life.</font>

629
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,070
<font color="yellow">I'm in so much pain.</font>

630
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,270
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die.</font>

631
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,530
<font color="yellow">They say law is equal to everyone.</font>

632
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,200
<font color="yellow">But in Korea, the powerful get off lightly...</font>

633
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,870
<font color="yellow">and the weak suffer.</font>

634
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,430
<font color="yellow">That is our heart-breaking reality.</font>

635
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,230
<font color="yellow">Stay strong, have hope and contact our programme.</font>

636
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,470
<font color="yellow">We won't make you pay.</font>

637
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,030
<font color="yellow">We should use that woman...</font>

638
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,070
<font color="yellow">to ruin Il Jae's campaign.</font>

639
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,770
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

640
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,400
<font color="yellow">Il Jae and Ji Soo had an affair before they got married.</font>

641
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,600
<font color="yellow">I'll reveal that on television.</font>

642
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,270
<font color="yellow">Find out what you can about Lawyer Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

643
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,630
<font color="yellow">Don't you know her?</font>

644
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,230
<font color="yellow">Should I?</font>

645
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,300
<font color="yellow">Of course. You spent so much time with her.</font>

646
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,270
<font color="yellow">- Chief Secretary.
-  Don't you remember?</font>

647
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,270
<font color="yellow">Oh Soo Yeon...</font>

648
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:37,800
<font color="yellow">Oh Soo...</font>

649
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,530
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
-  Sir.</font>

650
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,070
<font color="yellow">My head...</font>

651
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,400
<font color="yellow">I need to go to...</font>

652
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,430
<font color="yellow">- Sir!
-  Sir.</font>

653
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,700
<font color="yellow">Sir! Get him to bed.</font>

654
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,130
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me he can't remember her?</font>

655
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,730
<font color="yellow">I meant to tell you, but I forgot.</font>

656
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,430
<font color="yellow">Let's be more careful.</font>

657
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,400
<font color="yellow">He can't avoid her now that he needs her help.</font>

658
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:22,570
<font color="yellow">This is a problem.</font>

659
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,370
<font color="yellow">Don't be too disappointed.</font>

660
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,100
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group isn't the only way forward.</font>

661
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,310
<font color="yellow">He's right.</font>

662
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,830
<font color="yellow">The programme you're on is a hit.</font>

663
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,430
<font color="yellow">It'll all work out.</font>

664
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,270
<font color="yellow">This is Min and Oh Law Firm.</font>

665
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,700
<font color="yellow">What? Okay.</font>

666
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,900
<font color="yellow">Okay! Thank you!</font>

667
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,210
<font color="yellow">We got it!</font>

668
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,270
<font color="yellow">What did we get? Did we win the lottery or something?</font>

669
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:03,200
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group picked us to be their legal counsel!</font>

670
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,730
<font color="yellow">- Is that true?
-  You heard me answer the phone.</font>

671
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,070
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

672
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,500
<font color="yellow">- Who called?
-  The CEO's office.</font>

673
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,730
<font color="yellow">Which CEO?</font>

674
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,490
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Was it Do Gwang Woo?</font>

675
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:23,040
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo's in pharmaceuticals and Gun Woo's in the head office.</font>

676
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,100
<font color="yellow">Right. Then it must be Gun Woo.</font>

677
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,900
<font color="yellow">He wants us in his office by 4pm tomorrow.</font>

678
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,500
<font color="yellow">You made a huge call.</font>

679
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,300
<font color="yellow">You hired Soo Yeon as our legal counsel.</font>

680
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,170
<font color="yellow">Isn't that what you wanted?</font>

681
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, I wanted it this badly.</font>

682
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,870
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is your greatest supporter,</font>

683
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,730
<font color="yellow">and Soo Yeon hates him more than anyone.</font>

684
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,130
<font color="yellow">The decision's been made. Let's not talk about it.</font>

685
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:02,600
<font color="yellow">When you punched me in the hotel room,</font>

686
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,500
<font color="yellow">you acted like you didn't care,</font>

687
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,770
<font color="yellow">but I could tell you actually cared a lot about her.</font>

688
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,500
<font color="yellow">I said stop.</font>

689
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,680
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon kept showing up only to become our legal counsel.</font>

690
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,120
<font color="yellow">She actually hates you very much.</font>

691
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,870
<font color="yellow">She knows you're working with Il Jae.</font>

692
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,130
<font color="yellow">I said stop!</font>

693
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,330
<font color="yellow">She just used you.</font>

694
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,330
<font color="yellow">You're such a fool.</font>

697
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,270
<font color="yellow">What do you think they're saying?</font>

698
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:15,770
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

699
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,070
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

700
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,800
<font color="yellow">I can't hear them.</font>

701
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:32,830
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

702
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,200
<font color="yellow">I can't hear...</font>

703
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,330
<font color="yellow">what they're saying.</font>

00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,530
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

705
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,100
<font color="yellow">I used to be able to.</font>

706
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,800
<font color="yellow">Your first project will be the ship.</font>

707
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,730
<font color="yellow">Our sources say that...</font>

708
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,570
<font color="yellow">someone called K is in charge of the deal.</font>

709
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,400
<font color="yellow">I want to see the files on B World, Mr Byun's company.</font>

710
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,670
<font color="yellow">I never said I'd help you gain revenge.</font>

711
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,730
<font color="yellow">Why did you hire me, then?</font>

712
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,400
<font color="yellow">I hired you based on your strategy for appeals.</font>

713
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,200
<font color="yellow">It was quite a good one.</font>

714
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,270
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

715
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,870
<font color="yellow">There's a car in the basement parking lot.</font>

716
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,200
<font color="yellow">It's a company car, so don't worry about expenses.</font>

717
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,470
<font color="yellow">The Strategic Planning Department is looking into the man called K.</font>

00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,970
<font color="yellow">As soon as we find out more, come up with a strategy...</font>

719
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:36,930
<font color="yellow">that will win us the deal.</font>

720
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,500
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen him in a while,</font>

721
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,370
<font color="yellow">but Gun Woo still looks like a jerk.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Sir.
-  I don't believe they are.</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

726
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,430
<font color="yellow">Can she be trusted?</font>

727
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,430
<font color="yellow">She holds a deep-set grudge for Il Jae.</font>

728
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,200
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

729
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's true,</font>

730
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,100
<font color="yellow">but she thinks Il Jae killed her brother.</font>

731
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:20,970
<font color="yellow">Does she?</font>

732
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,470

755
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,070
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

756
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:49,200
<font color="yellow">The gap is widening.</font>

757
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,230
<font color="yellow">Ms Oh, please wrap up for us.</font>

758
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,230
<font color="yellow">Next week, we'll invite Congresswoman Hwang Ji Soo...</font>

762
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,130
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

763
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,370
<font color="yellow">I declined.</font>

00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,770
<font color="yellow">Didn't they say I refused?</font>

775
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,740
<font color="yellow">I think someone on the production crew messed up.</font>

776
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,430
<font color="yellow">They'll issue an apology. Don't worry.</font>

777
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,770
<font color="yellow">Of course they should.</font>

778
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,130
<font color="yellow">It bothers me that I said your name at the end of today's show.</font>

779
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:03,230
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid people might think you never keep your word.</font>

780
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,390
<font color="yellow">If I refuse after they mentioned me on air,</font>

781
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,470
<font color="yellow">would that harm your campaign?</font>

782
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,870
<font color="yellow">Say you'll be on the show. Don't fear Soo Yeon.</font>

783
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,170
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

784
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

785
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,300
<font color="yellow">If you're going to be on TV,</font>

786
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:25,070
<font color="yellow">try to boost your husband's support ratings.</font>

787
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,730
<font color="yellow">Will it be okay?</font>

788
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:33,370
<font color="yellow">She mentioned Guk Cheol when you were on last time.</font>

789
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,400
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

790
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,670
<font color="yellow">That's all that she knows.</font>

791
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,170
<font color="yellow">Will you not tell me who gave the tip?</font>

792
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:50,030
<font color="yellow">He doesn't want to be seen in public.</font>

793
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,000
<font color="yellow">He knows so much about Guk Cheol's case.</font>

794
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,600
<font color="yellow">It must be someone I know.</font>

795
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,530
<font color="yellow">If this works out,</font>

796
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,430
<font color="yellow">you'll meet him one day.</font>

797
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,100
<font color="yellow">- Well done.
-  Thank you.</font>

798
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:11,670
<font color="yellow">Can you manage?</font>

799
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,970
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. We'll do you proud.</font>

800
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,670
<font color="yellow">If only...</font>

801
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,700
<font color="yellow">reporters were there to cover Il Jae's campaign.</font>

802
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,670
<font color="yellow">I'll see what I can do.</font>

803
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,800
<font color="yellow">CEO Do Shin Young wishes to see you.</font>

804
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,660
<font color="yellow">Shin Young?</font>

805
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,470
<font color="yellow">Is it another dinner invitation?</font>

806
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,430
<font color="yellow">He doesn't want to meet you.</font>

807
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,830
<font color="yellow">He's not busy but...</font>

808
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,770
<font color="yellow">He doesn't want to?</font>

809
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:47,770
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

810
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:55,470
<font color="yellow">This is a very expensive champagne. I hope he enjoys it.</font>

811
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:56,470
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

812
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,800
<font color="yellow">If I give him a gift, he'll give something back.</font>

813
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,330
<font color="yellow">He doesn't like this.</font>

814
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,800
<font color="yellow">He doesn't like anything I try.</font>

815
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,390
<font color="yellow">Why is he so picky?</font>

816
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,270
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with him?
-  Ms Do.</font>

817
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,660
<font color="yellow">Tell him to come out.</font>

818
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,990
<font color="yellow">Let's see how great he looks!</font>

819
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,640
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

820
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,330
<font color="yellow">- Escort her downstairs.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

821
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,600
<font color="yellow">I don't care if we go bankrupt. Tell him to leave right now!</font>

822
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,540
<font color="yellow">What a jerk!</font>

823
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,450
<font color="yellow">I've had enough of this.</font>

824
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,660
<font color="yellow">I'm Do Shin Young.</font>

825
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,270
<font color="yellow">The only daughter of Do Choong!</font>

826
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,500
<font color="yellow">After all I did for him, he doesn't want to see me?</font>

827
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:42,870
<font color="yellow">He won't?</font>

828
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,850
<font color="yellow">Come out! Let's see your face!</font>

829
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:46,930
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
-  Ms Do.</font>

830
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,120
<font color="yellow">Find another hotel! Put me down!</font>

831
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,800
<font color="yellow">Get out of here!</font>

832
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,700
<font color="yellow">You don't know who I am!</font>

833
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,700
<font color="yellow">She was frothing at the mouth.</font>

834
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,430
<font color="yellow">I'm positive.</font>

835
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,870
<font color="yellow">I never liked Shin Young.</font>

836
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,850
<font color="yellow">Consumers suffer out of no mistake of their own.</font>

837
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:14,070
<font color="yellow">I wanted to help the people who lack power or money,</font>

838
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:16,130
<font color="yellow">so I motioned for the T9 law.</font>

839
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,130
<font color="yellow">I hope that Congress will pass it soon.</font>

840
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,570
<font color="yellow">Today, we're accepting live calls from viewers with legal problems.</font>

841
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,770
<font color="yellow">Let's take a call.</font>

842
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:31,830
<font color="yellow">It's time to go.</font>

843
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:35,670
<font color="yellow">Get to work.</font>

844
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,500
<font color="yellow">We have someone on the line.</font>

845
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,800
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

846
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:51,500
<font color="yellow">Hi, I'm Lee Tae Ri and I live in Hwagok-dong.</font>

847
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,170
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

848
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,030
<font color="yellow">Can dead people clear their names?</font>

849
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,460
<font color="yellow">Tell me your story first.</font>

850
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,770
<font color="yellow">Then I'll tell you what I think.</font>

851
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,670
<font color="yellow">The guy's name was Go Joo Tae.</font>

852
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,380
<font color="yellow">He was my best friend.</font>

853
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,470
<font color="yellow">I called because he was involved in a case...</font>

854
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,970
<font color="yellow">you once mentioned. Jung Man Ok's murder.</font>

855
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,600
<font color="yellow">How was he involved?</font>

856
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:16,500
<font color="yellow">Joo Tae...</font>

857
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:20,270
<font color="yellow">went to prison for killing Jung Man Ok...</font>

858
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,270
<font color="yellow">for Lee Guk Cheol.</font>

859
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,230
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

860
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,030
<font color="yellow">He told me that...</font>

861
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,270
<font color="yellow">he never killed Jung Man Ok.</font>

862
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:30,770
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

863
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,490
<font color="yellow">Why are you revealing this now?</font>

864
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,470
<font color="yellow">Because I found a strange photo among his belongings.</font>

865
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,710
<font color="yellow">What strange photo?</font>

866
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,030
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but can we cut this short?</font>

867
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,970
<font color="yellow">This is a live show. We can't edit anything.</font>

868
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,540
<font color="yellow">What photo is it?</font>

869
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,640
<font color="yellow">Jung Man Ok died on March 28, 2005.</font>

870
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,730
<font color="yellow">But this photo was taken on that same day.</font>

871
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,670
<font color="yellow">What is this photo?</font>

872
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,000
<font color="yellow">It shows Congresswoman Hwang and Byun Il Jae...</font>

873
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:07,170
<font color="yellow">Anyway, if this photo wasn't doctored, it means that...</font>

874
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,430
<font color="yellow">the two were having an affair.</font>

875
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:13,970
<font color="yellow">Did you just say they had an affair?</font>

876
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,130
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

877
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:17,660
<font color="yellow">Sir, could you send us...</font>

878
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,200
<font color="yellow">a copy of this photo?</font>

879
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,930
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

880
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:25,130
<font color="yellow">Why would you object?</font>

881
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:28,030
<font color="yellow">It's a lie. You can't air something that wasn't vetted...</font>

882
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:32,170
<font color="yellow">That's what we're trying to do now. To check.</font>

883
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:38,730
<font color="yellow">Dear fellow Seoul citizens.</font>

884
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,570
<font color="yellow">I wish to create...</font>

885
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,430
<font color="yellow">a city free of crime.</font>

886
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,630
<font color="yellow">A city where the diligent are respected.</font>

887
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,070
<font color="yellow">A city where...</font>

888
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,630
<font color="yellow">no one has to suffer due to administrative disasters.</font>

889
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,900
<font color="yellow">That is my goal and I will do this for you all.</font>

890
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:06,900
<font color="yellow">- Byun Il Jae.

-  Byun Il Jae.</font>

892
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,970
<font color="yellow">Which candidate's van is that?</font>

893
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,930
<font color="yellow">It's not a candidate's.</font>

894
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,270
<font color="yellow">Kang Gi Tan's here again.</font>

895
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,130
<font color="yellow">What is he doing here?</font>

896
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,670

900
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,000
<font color="yellow">Who called the reporters?</font>

901
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,470
<font color="yellow">It wasn't us.</font>

902
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:47,470

01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,400
<font color="yellow">I used to be...</font>

905
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,970
<font color="yellow">a prosecutor.</font>

906
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:02,770
<font color="yellow">To create a safer Seoul, I promise that...</font>

907
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:24,670
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

908
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,530
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae, one of the candidates for Seoul mayor,</font>

909
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:32,700
<font color="yellow">and Congresswoman Hwang were having an affair at the time?</font>
