<font color="yellow">Your Honour,</font>

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,200
<font color="yellow">I would like to request one last witness.</font>

4
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,300
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Oh, didn't you finish with your interrogation?</font>

5
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,370
<font color="yellow">Your Honour,</font>

6
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,570
<font color="yellow">the last witness, Ok Chae Ryung...</font>

7
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,440
<font color="yellow">I won't accept any more witnesses.</font>

-  Your Honour.</font>

00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,870
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae illegally imprisoned Ok Chae Ryung...</font>

10
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,700
<font color="yellow">in an insane asylum in order to hide evidence of lobbying.</font>

11
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,500
<font color="yellow">It's a false accusation.</font>

12
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,140
<font color="yellow">I swear...</font>

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,450
<font color="yellow">Just two hours ago,</font>

14
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,450
<font color="yellow">Ok Chae Ryung was imprisoned in a hospital.</font>

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,470
<font color="yellow">I can prove it to you by confirming with the police.</font>

16
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,640
<font color="yellow">I accept the witness.</font>

17
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,640
<font color="yellow">In return for giving up candidacy and for supporting him,</font>

18
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,500
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae gave Cho Cham...</font>

19
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,970
<font color="yellow">2.5 million dollars.</font>

20
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,500
<font color="yellow">What role did you play in it?</font>

21
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,270
<font color="yellow">I was the broker who passed on the money...</font>

22
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,870
<font color="yellow">to the gallery in Insa-dong.</font>

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,510
<font color="yellow">He must have imprisoned you...</font>

24
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,940
<font color="yellow">in order to keep that fact a secret.</font>

25
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,370
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,620
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you tell everyone...</font>

27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,600
<font color="yellow">that you were kidnapped by Byun Il Jae as well?</font>

28
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,140
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Oh,</font>

29
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,470
<font color="yellow">what is the witness talking about?</font>

30
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,640
<font color="yellow">It's the truth.</font>

31
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,300
<font color="yellow">The defendant kidnapped me...</font>

32
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,800
<font color="yellow">and attempted to kill me.</font>

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,700
<font color="yellow">It's a lie!</font>

34
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,670
<font color="yellow">The prosecution...</font>

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,300
<font color="yellow">planned this with the witness...</font>

36
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,140
<font color="yellow">I'm not finished yet.</font>

37
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,900
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,770
<font color="yellow">You should know better.</font>

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,920
<font color="yellow">But why...</font>

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,900
<font color="yellow">didn't you mention it?</font>

41
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,840
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

42
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,700
<font color="yellow">She has no evidence. Why else?</font>

43
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,170
<font color="yellow">I have the evidence.</font>

44
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,100
<font color="yellow">If you would allow me to stand as a witness,</font>

45
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,970
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you everything about Oh Soo Yeon's kidnapping.</font>

46
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,070
<font color="yellow">Get ready...</font>

47
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,500
<font color="yellow">to cut off the tail.</font>

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry?</font>

49
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,600
<font color="yellow">This case has nothing to do with me.</font>

50
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,500
<font color="yellow">Prepare for anything and everything...</font>

51
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,740
<font color="yellow">that could happen.</font>

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,770
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

53
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,900
<font color="yellow">It's over...</font>

54
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,140
<font color="yellow">for Il Jae.</font>

55
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,070
<font color="yellow">I knew that she was kidnapped,</font>

56
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,100
<font color="yellow">so I tailed behind.</font>

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,540
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae's aide, Oh Choong Dong,</font>

58
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,270
<font color="yellow">threw her into the river.</font>

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,070
<font color="yellow">Luckily, I was there.</font>

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,170
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon!</font>

61
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,700
<font color="yellow">I was able to save her.</font>

62
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,370
<font color="yellow">All of this is recorded in my car's camera.</font>

63
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,700
<font color="yellow">If you'd like, I can hand it in right now...</font>

64
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,740
<font color="yellow">as evidence.</font>

65
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,570
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo.</font>

66
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,940
<font color="yellow">Seoul Mayor Byun Il Jae was sentenced to five years in prison.</font>

67
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,840
<font color="yellow">The defendant claimed that the ruling is unreasonable...</font>

68
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,170
<font color="yellow">and declared that they would go for appeal.</font>

69
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,570
<font color="yellow">In addition, Byun's aide Oh Choong Dong...</font>

70
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,560
<font color="yellow">will also get three years of imprisonment.</font>

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,470
<font color="yellow">Everyone is curious how this case will impact...</font>

72
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,170
<font color="yellow">Hwang Jae Man of the Hanguk Party.</font>

73
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,260
<font color="yellow">Did Gun Woo give...</font>

74
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,070
<font color="yellow">an unfavourable testimony against Il Jae at court?</font>

75
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,660
<font color="yellow">It was a big hit.</font>

76
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,870
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo fainted.</font>

77
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,180
<font color="yellow">I guess this marks an end...</font>

78
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,940
<font color="yellow">to Il Jae and Gun Woo.</font>

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,440
<font color="yellow">He raised a dog...</font>

80
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,870
<font color="yellow">and it bit him in the neck.</font>

81
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,150
<font color="yellow">But for us, they prepared a feast.</font>

82
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,100
<font color="yellow">Then we should grab our forks.</font>

83
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,770
<font color="yellow">Should I call Uncle Jae Man?</font>

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,540
<font color="yellow">Let's give him a little breather.</font>

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,760
<font color="yellow">Just because we're hungry...</font>

86
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,840
<font color="yellow">doesn't mean we should pig out at a funeral home.</font>

87
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,740
<font color="yellow">I knew this already,</font>

88
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,170
<font color="yellow">but Gun Woo...</font>

89
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,170
<font color="yellow">is a complete idiot.</font>

90
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,960
<font color="yellow">When I saw him testify,</font>

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,840
<font color="yellow">I was so surprised.</font>

92
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,200
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

93
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,470
<font color="yellow">Why did you drink so much?</font>

94
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,140
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

95
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,670
<font color="yellow">I'm not all right.</font>

96
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,800
<font color="yellow">I trust you, Gun Woo.</font>

97
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,970
<font color="yellow">I think your wife and Gwang Woo...</font>

98
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,400
<font color="yellow">will meet with Mr Hwang soon.</font>

99
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,470
<font color="yellow">I just talked to Gun Woo.</font>

100
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,900
<font color="yellow">He has a plan in store.</font>

101
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,340
<font color="yellow">I'll trust him.</font>

102
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,800
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung got a suspended sentence.</font>

103
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

104
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,100
<font color="yellow">I understand, Father.</font>

105
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,670
<font color="yellow">You're a free person now.</font>

106
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,640
<font color="yellow">I persuaded Father.</font>

107
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,800
<font color="yellow">- I should be beside...
-  I know you wanted to leave.</font>

108
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,040
<font color="yellow">Combined with your asset,</font>

109
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,700
<font color="yellow">you can probably buy out a hotel overseas.</font>

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,340
<font color="yellow">- Boss.
-  I thought that was your dream.</font>

111
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,200
<font color="yellow">Do what you want...</font>

112
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,670
<font color="yellow">and live happily.</font>

113
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,470
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

114
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,470
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung.</font>

115
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,470
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

116
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,040
<font color="yellow">My life is yours.</font>

117
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,600
<font color="yellow">Call me whenever you need me.</font>

118
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,640
<font color="yellow">You don't have to fake a smile, Uncle.</font>

119
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,440
<font color="yellow">That won't hide your thoughts.</font>

120
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,670
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

121
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,870
<font color="yellow">This is just the beginning.</font>

122
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,410
<font color="yellow">But it seems like everyone's shocked.</font>

123
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
<font color="yellow">This is only the tip of the iceberg.</font>

124
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,600
<font color="yellow">I won't stay in prison for long, Guk Cheol.</font>

125
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,270
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed, too.</font>

126
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,170
<font color="yellow">You're paying too little for what you've done.</font>

127
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,570
<font color="yellow">I will get you an expensive one next time.</font>

128
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,910
<font color="yellow">When I come back out,</font>

129
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,670
<font color="yellow">you will get a taste of a blazing inferno.</font>

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,240
<font color="yellow">I already have tasted that inferno.</font>

131
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,640
<font color="yellow">Let me escort you to that inferno.</font>

132
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,500
<font color="yellow">Great job, Soo Yeon.</font>

133
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,570
<font color="yellow">I think I deserve to be a part of this.</font>

134
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,270
<font color="yellow">You do. You helped out big time.</font>

135
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,910
<font color="yellow">But I was surprised...</font>

136
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,870
<font color="yellow">that you betrayed Il Jae.</font>

137
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,140
<font color="yellow">I promised something with Soo Yeon.</font>

138
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,910
<font color="yellow">We need to make Il Jae rot in prison forever.</font>

139
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,500
<font color="yellow">What happened to tax evasion documents?</font>

140
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,740
<font color="yellow">He's clean. He was really ready for this.</font>

141
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,010
<font color="yellow">Where's evidence on money laundering from his paper company?</font>

142
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,070
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for it.</font>

143
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,410
<font color="yellow">Il Jae will soon make an appeal.</font>

144
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,570
<font color="yellow">If we can't get it until then...</font>

145
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,800
<font color="yellow">He won't get out that easily.</font>

146
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,910
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang and I will make sure.</font>

147
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,540
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Chairman Kang?</font>

148
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,700
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Soo Yeon.</font>

149
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,740
<font color="yellow">I have a favour to ask.</font>

150
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,970
<font color="yellow">Can you talk to Shin Young...</font>

151
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,340
<font color="yellow">and make her back up my father during this general meeting?</font>

152
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me?</font>

153
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,840
<font color="yellow">I heard that you are on good terms with her.</font>

154
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,800
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't for my father.</font>

155
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,340
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if she'll listen,</font>

156
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,970
<font color="yellow">but I will talk to her.</font>

157
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,900
<font color="yellow">What is this weird and odd combination of people?</font>

158
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,270
<font color="yellow">How did you find us?</font>

159
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,870
<font color="yellow">I asked her to come.</font>

160
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,970
<font color="yellow">Shin Young, come and have a drink.</font>

161
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,240
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking. You're drunk.</font>

162
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,230
<font color="yellow">I'm not drunk.</font>

163
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,070
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying that I'm drunk?</font>

164
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,700
<font color="yellow">You said the same thing that day.</font>

165
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,440
<font color="yellow">That again!</font>

166
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,800
<font color="yellow">Will that go on forever?</font>

167
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,140
<font color="yellow">Kang Ga Din.</font>

168
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,570
<font color="yellow">Can't you see my glass is empty?</font>

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,040
<font color="yellow">You need to stop.</font>

170
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,700
<font color="yellow">Shin Young is an awful drunk.</font>

171
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,670
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

172
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,100
<font color="yellow">You. Don't smile at other girls.</font>

173
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,540
<font color="yellow">He's mine now.</font>

174
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,670
<font color="yellow">You. Stay away from him.</font>

175
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,170
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you if you get close.</font>

176
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,140
<font color="yellow">She's drunk right now, so don't mind her.</font>

177
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,570
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo seems to think of you as a business partner.</font>

178
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,540
<font color="yellow">I don't trust him.</font>

179
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,300
<font color="yellow">You saw him, too.</font>

180
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,440
<font color="yellow">He betrayed Il Jae like it was nothing.</font>

181
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,970
<font color="yellow">I don't trust Gi Tan.</font>

182
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,870
<font color="yellow">Then why did you ask him for help?</font>

183
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,870
<font color="yellow">I decided to take the first step.</font>

184
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,500
<font color="yellow">CEO Do is the one...</font>

185
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,300
<font color="yellow">who asked Il Jae to kill...</font>

186
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,400
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan's parents.</font>

187
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,040
<font color="yellow">He's the one...</font>

188
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,040
<font color="yellow">who almost killed me by framing me for a murder.</font>

189
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,140
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo and Gun Woo are my next targets.</font>

190
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,270
<font color="yellow">His approaching Shin Young is...</font>

191
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,870
<font color="yellow">to get to Gwang Woo and me.</font>

192
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,640
<font color="yellow">Our next battlefield will be the general meeting.</font>

193
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,770
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo and Gwang Woo...</font>

194
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,770
<font color="yellow">will be finished in this upcoming general meeting.</font>

195
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,700
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Jae Man.</font>

196
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,720
<font color="yellow">We'll help Il Jae on his appeal with the best lawyers...</font>

197
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,480
<font color="yellow">in this nation.</font>

198
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240
<font color="yellow">He won't be found not guilty,</font>

199
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,500
<font color="yellow">but he can at least be on a probation.</font>

200
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,460
<font color="yellow">Is this because of the general meeting?</font>

201
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,540
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

202
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,570
<font color="yellow">This general meeting is a head-on fight with Gun Woo.</font>

203
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,170
<font color="yellow">All right. So what do you want?</font>

204
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,770
<font color="yellow">We just need a piece of paper from Il Jae.</font>

205
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,600
<font color="yellow">A commission of authority giving over his rights to me...</font>

206
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,500
<font color="yellow">for this general meeting.</font>

207
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,440
<font color="yellow">He has a huge amount of shares.</font>

208
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,540
<font color="yellow">With that commission, we can turn over the meeting...</font>

209
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,740
<font color="yellow">Don't do it, Father.</font>

210
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,400
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo.</font>

211
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,000
<font color="yellow">You never helped us while we were in trouble.</font>

212
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,380
<font color="yellow">I can't watch them...</font>

213
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,350
<font color="yellow">trying to be friendly, now that they need us.</font>

214
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,700
<font color="yellow">We should be taking down Gun Woo.</font>

215
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,500
<font color="yellow">Aren't you angry with the thought of his rising into power?</font>

216
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,940
<font color="yellow">You're all the same to us.</font>

217
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,100
<font color="yellow">- I won't let him sign that.
-  Hey.</font>

218
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,940
<font color="yellow">Why are you so stubborn?</font>

219
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
<font color="yellow">Do something, Jae Man.</font>

220
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,300
<font color="yellow">I also understand...</font>

221
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,200
<font color="yellow">where Ji Soo is coming from.</font>

222
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,440
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

223
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,770
<font color="yellow">We can get good lawyers, too.</font>

224
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,370
<font color="yellow">If you want a signed commission from us,</font>

225
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,840
<font color="yellow">you should offer something else.</font>

226
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,270
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

227
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,800
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo, if you want something, tell them.</font>

228
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,770
<font color="yellow">Hand over Dodo Hotel to me.</font>

229
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,270
<font color="yellow">Wait, that's...</font>

230
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,970
<font color="yellow">for Shin Young...</font>

231
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,700
<font color="yellow">You didn't give it to her yet.</font>

232
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,470
<font color="yellow">If you give me the hotel, I'll get you the commission.</font>

233
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,980
<font color="yellow">Hey, Congresswoman, aren't you a bit too selfish?</font>

234
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,340
<font color="yellow">Forget about it then.</font>

235
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,600
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Father.</font>

236
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,100
<font color="yellow">It's a deal.</font>

237
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,970
<font color="yellow">- Mum.
-  We need the management rights.</font>

238
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,270
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the hotel. Bring me the signed commission.</font>

239
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
<font color="yellow">Sounds good.</font>

240
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,040
<font color="yellow">It's me, Mr Han.</font>

241
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,340
<font color="yellow">Great job, Mr Han.</font>

242
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,900
<font color="yellow">Request a meeting with Il Jae.</font>

243
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,640
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

244
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,370
<font color="yellow">How can you do this?</font>

245
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,570
<font color="yellow">Why are you eating by yourself? We should eat together.</font>

246
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,370
<font color="yellow">How dare you think about sharing a table with him?</font>

247
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,780
<font color="yellow">You can eat when he's done.</font>

248
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,140
<font color="yellow">Got it, you criminal?</font>

249
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,140
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir.</font>

250
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,840
<font color="yellow">4984, you have a visitor.</font>

251
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,400
<font color="yellow">Are you going to stand there all day?</font>

252
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,000
<font color="yellow">Or do you want me to get up?</font>

253
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,840
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd try to avoid me forever.</font>

254
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,430
<font color="yellow">This is rather earlier than I imagined.</font>

255
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,470
<font color="yellow">There's something I realised after meeting you.</font>

256
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,000
<font color="yellow">You can never win if you play...</font>

257
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,440
<font color="yellow">by someone else's rules.</font>

258
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

259
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,170
<font color="yellow">Are you going to make the rules?</font>

260
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,340
<font color="yellow">If you take a look at this,</font>

261
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,570
<font color="yellow">you'll understand what I mean.</font>

262
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,340
<font color="yellow">Tax evasion, embezzlement and money laundering.</font>

263
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,970
<font color="yellow">You committed every illegal crime possible when running a business.</font>

264
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,370
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

265
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,900
<font color="yellow">I learned all this from you.</font>

266
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,170
<font color="yellow">The document...</font>

267
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,000
<font color="yellow">you passed onto Soo Yeon was just the tip of the iceberg.</font>

268
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,870
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you...</font>

269
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,240
<font color="yellow">give her everything?</font>

270
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,390
<font color="yellow">They threw in their nets already.</font>

271
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,870
<font color="yellow">There's no need for me to waste my energy.</font>

272
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,940
<font color="yellow">I'll save it to catch the whale later,</font>

273
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,270
<font color="yellow">just like what I'm doing now.</font>

274
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,310
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want?</font>

275
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,680
<font color="yellow">There are two things.</font>

276
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,770
<font color="yellow">Give me the recording where I admitted that I'm a murderer.</font>

277
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,070
<font color="yellow">What else?</font>

278
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
<font color="yellow">B World.</font>

279
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,160
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

280
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,440
<font color="yellow">I'll give you handsome money for it.</font>

281
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,500
<font color="yellow">Hand it over to me.</font>

282
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,750
<font color="yellow">You have to do it before the EGM.</font>

283
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,200
<font color="yellow">If I don't hear anything until then,</font>

284
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,340
<font color="yellow">all those documents will be sent to the prosecutors' office.</font>

285
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,070
<font color="yellow">Once that happens,</font>

286
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,200
<font color="yellow">your appeal and your life will be over.</font>

287
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,770
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

288
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,170
<font color="yellow">I failed to recognise...</font>

289
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,740
<font color="yellow">my true enemy.</font>

290
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,770
<font color="yellow">The enemy you know about isn't your true enemy.</font>

291
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,440
<font color="yellow">I hope you like...</font>

292
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,800
<font color="yellow">the rules I've made,</font>

293
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,140
<font color="yellow">Chairman Byun.</font>

294
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,470
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

295
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,740
<font color="yellow">I told you, you stupid.</font>

296
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,800
<font color="yellow">Did you just laugh?</font>

297
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,540
<font color="yellow">Pardon? No.</font>

298
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,370
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you!</font>

299
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

300
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,440
<font color="yellow">How dare you laugh at me?</font>

301
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,750
<font color="yellow">Do I look like a joke to you?</font>

302
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,260
<font color="yellow">Die! Just die!</font>

303
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,740
<font color="yellow">- Please stop.
-  Let me go!</font>

304
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,470
<font color="yellow">- Chairman Byun!
-  Die!</font>

305
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,500
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

306
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

307
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,340
<font color="yellow">Who was the visitor?</font>

308
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
<font color="yellow">I was fooled by Gun Woo.</font>

309
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,770
<font color="yellow">He got me good.</font>

310
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,400
<font color="yellow">He came to visit you?</font>

311
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,200
<font color="yellow">I don't get him.</font>

312
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,540
<font color="yellow">I don't know how much of it is true...</font>

313
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,840
<font color="yellow">and how much of it is fake.</font>

314
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,140
<font color="yellow">I have no idea.</font>

315
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
<font color="yellow">I can't get a grasp on him.</font>

316
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,400
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll come and get you, Soo Yeon.</font>

317
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,170
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

318
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,770
<font color="yellow">Let's go to Min and Oh Law Firm.</font>

319
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,470
<font color="yellow">Okay. By the way, Sir.</font>

320
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,380
<font color="yellow">You allowed Lawyer Oh and Gi Tan to meet before.</font>

321
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,740
<font color="yellow">That was on purpose.</font>

322
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,840
<font color="yellow">How do you know my name?</font>

323
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,480
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Gi Tan?</font>

324
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,740
<font color="yellow">We were...</font>

325
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,770
<font color="yellow">I knew that he had...</font>

326
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,600
<font color="yellow">a bullet in his head.</font>

327
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,770
<font color="yellow">I made them meet on purpose.</font>

328
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,970
<font color="yellow">That's the only way...</font>

329
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,600
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon will give up him.</font>

330
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,700
<font color="yellow">I did it to win Soo Yeon.</font>

331
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,640
<font color="yellow">I'm going...</font>

332
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,370
<font color="yellow">to make her mine.</font>

333
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

334
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,650
<font color="yellow">One of our guards at the prison called me.</font>

335
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,270
<font color="yellow">Apparently, Gun Woo came to visit Il Jae.</font>

336
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,480
<font color="yellow">What did they talk about?</font>

337
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,300
<font color="yellow">They used a special visiting room, so they have no idea.</font>

338
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he went to make a deal or a threat.</font>

339
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,860
<font color="yellow">Either way,</font>

340
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,170
<font color="yellow">it means the two of them will partner up.</font>

341
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,770
<font color="yellow">Call Shin Young and ask her for lunch.</font>

342
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

343
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,020
<font color="yellow">Are you finally going to use her?</font>

344
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,800
<font color="yellow">The tide's coming in faster than I thought.</font>

345
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,470
<font color="yellow">We better get our ship ready.</font>

346
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,010
<font color="yellow">Quit drinking.</font>

347
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,070
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

348
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,300
<font color="yellow">If you don't, I won't do business with you.</font>

349
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,800
<font color="yellow">You're so childish.</font>

350
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,340
<font color="yellow">Fine, let's talk business.</font>

351
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

352
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,740
<font color="yellow">let me ask you one thing beforehand.</font>

353
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,260
<font color="yellow">If you were planning to work with me,</font>

354
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,640
<font color="yellow">why did you sign with Gun Woo for the Chinese ships?</font>

355
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,160
<font color="yellow">That was the best question...</font>

356
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,300
<font color="yellow">you've ever asked me.</font>

357
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,670
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

358
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,470
<font color="yellow">Then give me your best answer.</font>

359
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,740
<font color="yellow">It costs a fortune...</font>

360
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,840
<font color="yellow">to win the bid for building a ship.</font>

361
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,670
<font color="yellow">But the banks won't let you...</font>

362
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,170
<font color="yellow">get insurance since it's too risky.</font>

363
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,890
<font color="yellow">- That's why we...
-  Too complicated.</font>

364
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,900
<font color="yellow">Simplify it for me.</font>

365
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,770
<font color="yellow">What he's saying is,</font>

366
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,870
<font color="yellow">people will get on the ship thinking it's a cruise ship.</font>

367
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,770
<font color="yellow">But in fact, it's a very dangerous one.</font>

368
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,260
<font color="yellow">We never know when it'll sink.</font>

369
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,530
<font color="yellow">I see. You're making...</font>

370
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,680
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo proceed with the ship contract...</font>

371
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,000
<font color="yellow">and then make him sink along with it?</font>

372
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,500
<font color="yellow">Bingo.</font>

373
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,370
<font color="yellow">There's something you have to do before then.</font>

374
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,120
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

375
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,600
<font color="yellow">Do you have shares to Dodo Pharmaceutical?</font>

376
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,420
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's Dodo Group's holding company.</font>

377
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,100
<font color="yellow">There's something called Shareholders' Voting Agreement.</font>

378
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,740
<font color="yellow">You should sign it.</font>

379
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,790
<font color="yellow">Shareholders' Voting Agreement?</font>

380
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,340
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's an agreement to prove that those shares...</font>

381
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,400
<font color="yellow">can be managed by the both of us.</font>

382
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,750
<font color="yellow">Are you a thief?</font>

383
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,030
<font color="yellow">Why should I share that with you?</font>

384
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,300
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking it for free.</font>

385
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,940
<font color="yellow">Which affiliate are you most interested in?</font>

386
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,250
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get it for me?</font>

387
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,940
<font color="yellow">That's how deals work.</font>

388
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,400
<font color="yellow">I want Dodo Hotel.</font>

389
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,680
<font color="yellow">I want to make it mine.</font>

390
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,460
<font color="yellow">It's my dream to turn it into a global hotel.</font>

391
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,840
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream.</font>

392
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,140
<font color="yellow">I'll make that hotel...</font>

393
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,870
<font color="yellow">yours.</font>

394
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,040
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

395
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,240
<font color="yellow">Then I'll sign the agreement.</font>

396
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
<font color="yellow">In return,</font>

397
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,630
<font color="yellow">you have to sign...</font>

398
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,840
<font color="yellow">a memorandum for me.</font>

399
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,170
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

400
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,670
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon, could you prepare the documents?</font>

401
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

402
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,240
<font color="yellow">(If Kang Gi Tan fails to keep his word, he must marry Do Shin Young.)</font>

403
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,780
<font color="yellow">What's written on there?</font>

404
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,300
<font color="yellow">If I don't keep my promise,</font>

405
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,970
<font color="yellow">I have to marry Shin Young.</font>

406
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,940
<font color="yellow">No matter how important business is, you shouldn't put your life on...</font>

407
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,340
<font color="yellow">May I get this notarised?</font>

408
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

409
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

410
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,470
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Things will proceed as planned.</font>

411
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,570
<font color="yellow">This is the Shareholders' Voting Agreement. Please sign it.</font>

412
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,040
<font color="yellow">We'll be on the same team for the rest of our lives, Ga Din.</font>

413
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,400
<font color="yellow">Call Gwang Woo right now for a meeting.</font>

414
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,680
<font color="yellow">Are we starting already?</font>

415
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,960
<font color="yellow">We're running out of time. Mr Moon, you can meet Gun Woo.</font>

416
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,040
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

417
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,010
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes, Shin Young.</font>

418
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,600
<font color="yellow">Are you ready?</font>

419
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

420
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,870
<font color="yellow">Does he want to meet me?</font>

421
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay. I'll be there.</font>

422
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,240
<font color="yellow">Mum, Gi Tan wants to meet me.</font>

423
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,340
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

424
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,640
<font color="yellow">It looks like Shin Young successfully lured him in.</font>

425
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,920
<font color="yellow">She has an awful temper,</font>

426
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,340
<font color="yellow">but she's good with men.</font>

427
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,370
<font color="yellow">Il Jae's on our side, and now, it's Gi Tan.</font>

428
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,840
<font color="yellow">You look glad, Chairwoman.</font>

429
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,740
<font color="yellow">My victory day is coming soon. Why wouldn't I be glad?</font>

430
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,770
<font color="yellow">We won't know if it will be victorious or disastrous for you...</font>

431
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,170
<font color="yellow">until the day comes.</font>

432
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,000
<font color="yellow">I heard you're busy gathering shares.</font>

433
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,360
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard you try, the scale won't get turned over.</font>

434
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,840
<font color="yellow">They're all in vain.</font>

435
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,970
<font color="yellow">Everyone has their own scale.</font>

436
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,970
<font color="yellow">If it's set as they please, they'll believe it as it is,</font>

437
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,530
<font color="yellow">not realising that it's broken.</font>

438
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,430
<font color="yellow">People are foolish, you know?</font>

439
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,170
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to tell you.</font>

440
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,170
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

441
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,600
<font color="yellow">throw away your broken scale.</font>

442
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,640
<font color="yellow">Don't embarrass Father because of you.</font>

443
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,800
<font color="yellow">You don't need to speak to him.</font>

444
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,940
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Gwang Woo.
-  Okay.</font>

445
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,200
<font color="yellow">What time was our meeting with Mr Moon?</font>

446
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
<font color="yellow">You can leave right now.</font>

447
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,270
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gi Tan.</font>

448
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,840
<font color="yellow">I mean, Chairman Kang.</font>

449
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,900
<font color="yellow">I was going to say hello when we were at court.</font>

450
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,240
<font color="yellow">We have a lot to talk about.</font>

451
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,740
<font color="yellow">Let's do that later.</font>

452
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, business first.</font>

453
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,100
<font color="yellow">Take a seat.</font>

454
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,770
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your eyes? Why are you twitching them?</font>

455
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,070
<font color="yellow">Oh, I have something in my eyes.</font>

456
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,280
<font color="yellow">Does he want to exchange stocks?</font>

457
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,370
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

458
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,240
<font color="yellow">We'll exchange Dodo Hotel's stocks, held by Chairman Do,</font>

459
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,170
<font color="yellow">and CEO Do Shin Young's stocks for Dodo Pharmaceutical.</font>

460
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,540
<font color="yellow">But why are you here to step into this problem?</font>

461
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,900
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang and CEO Do Shin Young...</font>

462
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,170
<font color="yellow">signed the Shareholders' Voting Agreement.</font>

463
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,300
<font color="yellow">Half of the stocks for Dodo Pharmaceutical are...</font>

464
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,270
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang's.</font>

465
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,870
<font color="yellow">Management rights will be decided with stocks for Dodo Pharmaceutical.</font>

466
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,650
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why she'd want to exchange those.</font>

467
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,000
<font color="yellow">CEO Do Shin Young is more interested in the hotel...</font>

468
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,940
<font color="yellow">than the management rights.</font>

469
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,970
<font color="yellow">Chairman respects that.</font>

470
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,710
<font color="yellow">What? Are you giving me all of your stocks for Dodo Pharmaceutical?</font>

471
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,400
<font color="yellow">It's not for free. I want to exchange it with your hotel shares.</font>

472
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,770
<font color="yellow">I'd be so thankful if you would do that.</font>

473
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,070
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd be the one who'd look out for me.</font>

474
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,240
<font color="yellow">You should thank him.</font>

475
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,040
<font color="yellow">Chairman K is the one who persuaded me.</font>

476
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,500
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Chairman Kang...</font>

477
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,440
<font color="yellow">for supporting us.</font>

478
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,740
<font color="yellow">What's the exchange rate?</font>

479
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,140
<font color="yellow">The price differences are like this.</font>

480
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,470
<font color="yellow">For 100,000 shares of Dodo Pharmaceutical,</font>

481
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,840
<font color="yellow">it's reasonable to give you 200,000 shares of Dodo Hotel.</font>

482
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,870
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

483
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,800
<font color="yellow">It should be more. That's the holding company.</font>

484
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,440
<font color="yellow">I'm saying that's what the price is, Shin Young.</font>

485
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,900
<font color="yellow">I'll throw in another 50,000.</font>

486
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,000
<font color="yellow">I'll exchange 100,000 for 250,000 shares for the hotel.</font>

487
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,400
<font color="yellow">It's me, Mr Moon.</font>

488
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,170
<font color="yellow">How much did CEO Do Gun Woo offer?</font>

489
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,100
<font color="yellow">What? Gun Woo?</font>

490
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,840
<font color="yellow">Is Gun Woo in this, too?</font>

491
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,140
<font color="yellow">Okay. Don't hang up.</font>

492
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,940
<font color="yellow">He offered 300,000 shares per 100,000.</font>

493
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,900
<font color="yellow">What? Did he say 300,000 shares?</font>

494
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,940
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. I'll add another 50,000.</font>

495
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,640
<font color="yellow">It's 350,000 shares for me.</font>

496
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,770
<font color="yellow">You don't even have that.</font>

497
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,300
<font color="yellow">Mum has some.</font>

498
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,400
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is saying that with Father's shares, too.</font>

499
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,100
<font color="yellow">I'm not backing away!</font>

500
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,570
<font color="yellow">He just offered 350,000 shares.</font>

501
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,170
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo offered 350,000 shares.</font>

502
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,570
<font color="yellow">You wanted to get the highest price by putting us against each other.</font>

503
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,040
<font color="yellow">You should hold back a fight and bargain on businesses.</font>

504
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,040
<font color="yellow">That's what business is, isn't it?</font>

505
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,540
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 400,000 shares and no more.</font>

506
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,040
<font color="yellow">He's offered 400,000 shares.</font>

507
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,640
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo offered 400,000 shares.</font>

508
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,050
<font color="yellow">What? He must be insane.</font>

509
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,740
<font color="yellow">I know it's the holding company,</font>

510
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,700
<font color="yellow">but there are lines.</font>

511
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,770
<font color="yellow">How much more do you want?</font>

512
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,470
<font color="yellow">He won't give up. The general meeting is right around the corner.</font>

513
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,070
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

514
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,370
<font color="yellow">- It looks like he's giving up so...
-  I'll give 500,000.</font>

515
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,800
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 500,000.</font>

516
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,700
<font color="yellow">Let's make it 5 to 1.</font>

517
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,470
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

518
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,170
<font color="yellow">Mum will be so mad.</font>

519
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,910
<font color="yellow">This is about the management rights.</font>

520
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,440
<font color="yellow">I can't give it up.</font>

521
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,720
<font color="yellow">Tell Gun Woo that we're sealing the deal with this one.</font>

522
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

523
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,470
<font color="yellow">He gave up 500,000 shares.</font>

524
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,870
<font color="yellow">Things are overheating. We should end things here.</font>

525
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,400
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 550,000 shares.</font>

526
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,340
<font color="yellow">I will talk to Chairman.</font>

527
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,200
<font color="yellow">Forget about the past. Let's walk to our bright future, Chairman Kang.</font>

528
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,070
<font color="yellow">Anyways, if you two are holding a joint agreement,</font>

529
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,540
<font color="yellow">are you two by any chance...</font>

530
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,380
<font color="yellow">We don't have that kind of relationship.</font>

531
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,570
<font color="yellow">That's why relationships are called relationships.</font>

532
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,600
<font color="yellow">They get all tied up and get very confusing.</font>

533
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,140
<font color="yellow">Sometimes they become something, don't they?</font>

534
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,240
<font color="yellow">You should leave if you're finished.</font>

535
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,470
<font color="yellow">Okay, Shin Young. I'll get going.</font>

536
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:51,300
<font color="yellow">Help Chairman out with his business...</font>

537
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,670
<font color="yellow">and be nice to him, okay?</font>

538
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,770
<font color="yellow">You're a genius.</font>

539
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,640
<font color="yellow">You just got five times as much.</font>

540
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,800
<font color="yellow">I'm really amazed.</font>

541
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,400
<font color="yellow">Just follow me. You'll become the first in line of Dodo Group.</font>

542
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,870
<font color="yellow">Kang Ga Din.</font>

543
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,200
<font color="yellow">Be careful, Chairman.</font>

544
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,100
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

545
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,010
<font color="yellow">Those people are eyeing us in strange ways.</font>

546
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,400
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about those trash.</font>

547
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,540
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
-  To the restroom.</font>

548
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,900
<font color="yellow">- I'll take you there.
-  2757!</font>

549
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,510
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

550
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

551
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,550
<font color="yellow">Wait. What...</font>

552
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,970
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

553
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,840
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

554
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
<font color="yellow">It was nothing.</font>

555
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,600
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

556
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,570
<font color="yellow">Let me see. Is it bad?</font>

557
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,810
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

558
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,470
<font color="yellow">Were you attacked?</font>

559
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,450
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

560
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,740
<font color="yellow">By whom?</font>

561
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,340
<font color="yellow">The wardens said they're men...</font>

562
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,350
<font color="yellow">who held a grudge against me...</font>

563
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,070
<font color="yellow">from my days as a prosecutor.</font>

564
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,550
<font color="yellow">But I don't remember them.</font>

565
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,270
<font color="yellow">Then the one who did this to you...</font>

566
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,560
<font color="yellow">It has to be Gi Tan.</font>

567
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,060
<font color="yellow">It's too dangerous here.</font>

568
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,460
<font color="yellow">I'll apply for a transfer.</font>

569
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,520
<font color="yellow">It'll be the same anywhere.</font>

570
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,200
<font color="yellow">I'm safer here.</font>

571
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,270
<font color="yellow">Hang in there.</font>

572
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,520
<font color="yellow">We'll win the appeal...</font>

573
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,530
<font color="yellow">and get you out of here.</font>

574
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,970
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

575
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,740
<font color="yellow">This is from...</font>

576
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,010
<font color="yellow">Chairwoman Hwang Gwi Ja.</font>

577
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,700
<font color="yellow">She wants you...</font>

578
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,170
<font color="yellow">to sign over...</font>

579
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,340
<font color="yellow">your Dodo Pharmaceutical shares.</font>

580
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,540
<font color="yellow">We'll take Dodo Hotel instead.</font>

581
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,200
<font color="yellow">We're giving up on Gun Woo, so this works for us.</font>

582
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,800
<font color="yellow">Do you really think that Gwang Woo and Chairwoman Hwang...</font>

583
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,670
<font color="yellow">can beat Gun Woo...</font>

584
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,990
<font color="yellow">at the general meeting?</font>

585
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,410
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

586
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,270
<font color="yellow">It's practically a done deal.</font>

587
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,470
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is...</font>

588
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,900
<font color="yellow">more cunning than...</font>

589
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,610
<font color="yellow">I ever imagined.</font>

590
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,640
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

591
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,340
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

592
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,770
<font color="yellow">I can solve it...</font>

593
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,840
<font color="yellow">once I get out.</font>

594
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,840
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry.</font>

595
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,840
<font color="yellow">(Power of Attorney)</font>

596
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,740
<font color="yellow">Welcome, Sir.</font>

597
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,170
<font color="yellow">Did you find a way...</font>

598
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,420
<font color="yellow">to confiscate everything I gave my wife and Gwang Woo?</font>

599
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,070
<font color="yellow">Have a seat first.</font>

600
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,670
<font color="yellow">Ms Hong, bring some tea.</font>

601
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,540
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
-  Forget the tea.</font>

602
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,940
<font color="yellow">Tell me. What's the plan?</font>

603
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,460
<font color="yellow">When you gave your wife the shares,</font>

604
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,200
<font color="yellow">she signed a contract.</font>

605
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,750
<font color="yellow">If any of her actions are the cause for divorce,</font>

606
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,070
<font color="yellow">you can take back everything you transferred to her.</font>

607
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,470
<font color="yellow">Was there such a clause?</font>

608
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,270
<font color="yellow">Yes. See for yourself.</font>

609
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,170
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

610
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,070
<font color="yellow">I remember now.</font>

611
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,950
<font color="yellow">What your wife did after you collapsed...</font>

612
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,530
<font color="yellow">is grounds for divorce.</font>

613
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,960
<font color="yellow">As her son,</font>

614
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,570
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo will also have to give up his assets.</font>

615
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,770
<font color="yellow">Put things in motion.</font>

616
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,470
<font color="yellow">At the general meeting,</font>

617
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,340
<font color="yellow">I will crush them both.</font>

618
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,250
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

619
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,360
<font color="yellow">Civil cases take time.</font>

620
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,320
<font color="yellow">It can't be done by then.</font>

621
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,540
<font color="yellow">That's too bad.</font>

622
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,900
<font color="yellow">After the general meeting,</font>

623
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,540
<font color="yellow">apply for a warrant...</font>

624
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,640
<font color="yellow">of provisional attachment.</font>

625
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

626
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,240
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

627
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,770
<font color="yellow">Can you organise a family meeting as soon as possible?</font>

628
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,470
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

629
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,540
<font color="yellow">I want to confirm something.</font>

630
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,370
<font color="yellow">Why is a sick man always out and about?</font>

631
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,270
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

632
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,170
<font color="yellow">Can't you try to be nice?</font>

633
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,440
<font color="yellow">You're the one who verbally abused me.</font>

634
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,540
<font color="yellow">We wouldn't be in this mess if you were nice.</font>

635
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,570
<font color="yellow">Tonight,</font>

636
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,650
<font color="yellow">call the kids over.</font>

637
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,970
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

638
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,710
<font color="yellow">To write a will?</font>

639
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,970
<font color="yellow">Before the general meeting,</font>

640
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,270
<font color="yellow">we need to get our stories straight as a family.</font>

641
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,100
<font color="yellow">Or else,</font>

642
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,800
<font color="yellow">everyone will find out what a mess we are.</font>

643
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,440
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to save face?</font>

644
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,800
<font color="yellow">To rich people like us,</font>

645
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:10,100
<font color="yellow">our reputation is our brand, you foolish woman.</font>

646
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,470
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling foolish, you senile, old rat?</font>

647
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,600
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

648
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,450
<font color="yellow">Start looking for a house.</font>

649
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,320
<font color="yellow">What for, Ma'am?</font>

650
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,700
<font color="yellow">Once the general meeting's over,</font>

651
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,170
<font color="yellow">I will kick you both out of my house.</font>

652
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,970
<font color="yellow">Find a place before then or you'll end up on the streets.</font>

653
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,800
<font color="yellow">She's going too far.</font>

654
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,740
<font color="yellow">First, she slapped you.</font>

655
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,570
<font color="yellow">And now, she's kicking...</font>

656
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,720
<font color="yellow">I told you not to mention that.</font>

657
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,010
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Sir.</font>

658
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,840
<font color="yellow">Find a place.</font>

659
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,540
<font color="yellow">A small and run-down place.</font>

660
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,600
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

661
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,470
<font color="yellow">That hag and Gwang Woo...</font>

662
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,640
<font color="yellow">will need to move out...</font>

663
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,370
<font color="yellow">after the general meeting.</font>

664
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,570
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

665
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,360
<font color="yellow">I can't believe...</font>

666
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,100
<font color="yellow">you're attending our family gathering.</font>

667
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,090
<font color="yellow">Our father invited her...</font>

668
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,200
<font color="yellow">as Dodo Group's legal counsel.</font>

669
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,090
<font color="yellow">Will her presence change anything?</font>

670
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,470
<font color="yellow">It won't, so don't mind her.</font>

671
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,870
<font color="yellow">Welcome, Chairman Kang.</font>

672
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,470
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mum.</font>

673
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,570
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

674
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,820
<font color="yellow">Money really does change a man. You look so much more handsome.</font>

675
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,840
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

676
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,340
<font color="yellow">Where is Dad?</font>

677
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,470
<font color="yellow">He'll be here soon.</font>

678
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,170
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

679
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,970
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

680
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,340
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

681
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,000
<font color="yellow">I was hungry.</font>

682
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:05,040
<font color="yellow">The others are downstairs waiting for you to join them.</font>

683
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,070
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

684
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,340
<font color="yellow">Is it someone's birthday?</font>

685
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,950
<font color="yellow">Didn't you tell everyone to come over?</font>

686
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:12,970
<font color="yellow">Did I?</font>

687
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,670
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

688
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,170
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

689
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,840
<font color="yellow">It's a very important day.</font>

690
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,070
<font color="yellow">Sir. Sir.</font>

691
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,370
<font color="yellow">Sit in the wheelchair.</font>

692
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,600
<font color="yellow">That's right. I forgot.</font>

693
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,070
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

694
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,640
<font color="yellow">Come on, push me.</font>

695
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,170
<font color="yellow">If you're too tired, you can postpone...</font>

696
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,100
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Take me downstairs.</font>

697
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
<font color="yellow">I called you all...</font>

698
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,640
<font color="yellow">so we could...</font>

699
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,470
<font color="yellow">go through the details...</font>

700
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,960
<font color="yellow">before the general meeting.</font>

701
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,370
<font color="yellow">Everything's sorted. What's left to discuss?</font>

702
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,070
<font color="yellow">- Jae Man.
-  Yes.</font>

703
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,270
<font color="yellow">My son-in-law signed this.</font>

704
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,570
<font color="yellow">This power of attorney states that he'll transfer his shares...</font>

705
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,670
<font color="yellow">to Chairwoman Hwang.</font>

706
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,470
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Father.</font>

707
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,840
<font color="yellow">Shin Young's shares of Dodo Pharmaceutical...</font>

708
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,970
<font color="yellow">That deal's been made already.</font>

709
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,740
<font color="yellow">I'll be getting those tomorrow.</font>

710
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,570
<font color="yellow">This isn't what we agreed on.</font>

711
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,610
<font color="yellow">I thought the deal with you would stand, but...</font>

712
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,170
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo's terms were better.</font>

713
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,070
<font color="yellow">Business is about profit.</font>

714
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,570
<font color="yellow">It can't be helped.</font>

715
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,570
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Dad.</font>

716
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,570
<font color="yellow">Mum said that...</font>

717
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,610
<font color="yellow">she'd give me Dodo Hotel.</font>

718
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:01,700
<font color="yellow">What does she mean?</font>

719
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,730
<font color="yellow">You said it would be mine.</font>

720
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,350
<font color="yellow">It turned out a little differently.</font>

721
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:08,070
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the golf course in Yongin instead.</font>

722
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,670
<font color="yellow">A golf course isn't a hotel.</font>

723
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,730
<font color="yellow">You can't have Il Jae's power of attorney.</font>

724
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,370
<font color="yellow">- Ji Soo.
-  Add to that...</font>

725
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,370
<font color="yellow">the home shopping channel.</font>

726
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,900
<font color="yellow">Jae Man, the home shopping channel...</font>

727
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,970
<font color="yellow">I want that instead.</font>

728
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,050
<font color="yellow">That might be enough to placate me.</font>

729
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,470
<font color="yellow">Mum, isn't that a bit too much?</font>

730
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,470
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

731
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,540
<font color="yellow">Fine. The golf course and the home shopping channel.</font>

732
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,570
<font color="yellow">Someone wants to make his illegitimate son his heir.</font>

733
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:41,840
<font color="yellow">What wouldn't I do for my own flesh and blood?</font>

734
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,200
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

735
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,570
<font color="yellow">All of you.</font>

736
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,770
<font color="yellow">What are you doing with my assets?</font>

737
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,340
<font color="yellow">Every company in Dodo Group...</font>

738
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,170
<font color="yellow">I built up from scratch!</font>

739
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,170
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

740
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,070
<font color="yellow">What makes you think you can split them among yourselves?</font>

741
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,770
<font color="yellow">Do you still think they're yours?</font>

742
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:09,520
<font color="yellow">You're wrong!</font>

743
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,070
<font color="yellow">Everything will become mine...</font>

744
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:13,100
<font color="yellow">at the general meeting!</font>

745
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,840
<font color="yellow">The meeting hasn't happened yet.</font>

746
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,610
<font color="yellow">Don't celebrate before the fight even begins.</font>

747
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,160
<font color="yellow">That's just foolish.</font>

748
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,370
<font color="yellow">We're celebrating because we can.</font>

749
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:24,100
<font color="yellow">We're used to partying.</font>

750
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,260
<font color="yellow">Did you see this?</font>

751
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,120
<font color="yellow">Other than you and I, the rest are like hyenas.</font>

752
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,770
<font color="yellow">What? Hyenas?</font>

753
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,240
<font color="yellow">I'll toss them some rotten meat and sort them out.</font>

754
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,400
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

755
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:37,470
<font color="yellow">I think I should leave.</font>

756
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,400
<font color="yellow">Already? You haven't eaten yet.</font>

757
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,170
<font color="yellow">You can take your time.</font>

758
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,540
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

759
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,300
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't keep your private life and work separate.</font>

760
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,140
<font color="yellow">It's a business transaction. Watch what you say.</font>

761
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,640
<font color="yellow">When it comes to business, I'm the better catch.</font>

762
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,170
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo, don't get ahead of yourself.</font>

763
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,100
<font color="yellow">I did it to benefit Shin Young, not to help you.</font>

764
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,400
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

765
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,970
<font color="yellow">If this is it,</font>

766
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,170
<font color="yellow">we should leave, too.</font>

767
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,140
<font color="yellow">Okay, Dad.</font>

768
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,170
<font color="yellow">Jae Man.</font>

769
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,570
<font color="yellow">What did you bring as my birthday present?</font>

770
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,170
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me...</font>

771
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,470
<font color="yellow">you came empty-handed.</font>

772
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,170
<font color="yellow">Bok Shin, go and get...</font>

773
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,240
<font color="yellow">the birthday cake.</font>

774
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,970
<font color="yellow">Right now.</font>

775
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,600
<font color="yellow">What cake?</font>

776
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,240
<font color="yellow">Today's my birthday.</font>

777
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,370
<font color="yellow">I'll cut the cake...</font>

778
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,270
<font color="yellow">and blow out the candles.</font>

779
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,840
<font color="yellow">You were born in the winter.</font>

780
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,370
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

781
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:49,170
<font color="yellow">You cooked me birthday soup.</font>

782
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,470
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

783
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,470
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

784
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,100
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

785
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,870
<font color="yellow">Go and get your grandmother.</font>

786
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,220
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

787
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,300
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

788
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,370
<font color="yellow">Get the cake.</font>

789
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,590
<font color="yellow">When did this start?</font>

790
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,540
<font color="yellow">He'd been a bit forgetful, but it was never this serious.</font>

791
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,570
<font color="yellow">Wasn't he tested when he was last admitted?</font>

792
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,340
<font color="yellow">The doctor said he was fine.</font>

793
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,310
<font color="yellow">What happened to him then?</font>

794
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,770
<font color="yellow">It must be the drug's side effect.</font>

795
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,450
<font color="yellow">Side effect?</font>

796
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:32,740
<font color="yellow">The doctor said this could happen if the drug doesn't suit him.</font>

797
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,770
<font color="yellow">Is he on his way?</font>

798
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,370
<font color="yellow">He'll be here soon.</font>

799
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,740
<font color="yellow">It won't be dementia.</font>

800
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:44,870
<font color="yellow">No?</font>

801
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,870
<font color="yellow">To me, it looked just like dementia.</font>

802
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,470
<font color="yellow">The test he got a few days ago came back clean.</font>

803
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,970
<font color="yellow">You can't be sure. Have him tested again.</font>

804
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,670
<font color="yellow">If we can have him ruled mentally incapable,</font>

805
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,070
<font color="yellow">we could take...</font>

806
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,970
<font color="yellow">everything under his name.</font>

807
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:21,340
<font color="yellow">That family is much more twisted than I thought.</font>

808
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,310
<font color="yellow">It's gotten worse than when I was Chief Secretary.</font>

809
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:27,470
<font color="yellow">I'm glad we were there.</font>

810
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,230
<font color="yellow">I got to see the family for what they're really like.</font>

811
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,770
<font color="yellow">They all have different ideas. That leaves us with many openings.</font>

812
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,070
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

813
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,870
<font color="yellow">we can push ahead as planned.</font>

814
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,970
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Gun Woo.</font>

815
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,400
<font color="yellow">He won't give in just like that.</font>

816
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,970
<font color="yellow">The general meeting's the problem.</font>

817
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,600
<font color="yellow">Now, Gwang Woo owns Shin Young's Dodo Pharmaceutical shares.</font>

818
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,400
<font color="yellow">My chance of beating them is now much slimmer.</font>

819
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,140
<font color="yellow">If I lose,</font>

820
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,840
<font color="yellow">Father will suffer even more.</font>

821
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

822
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,970
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be of help to you.</font>

823
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,170
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan hates me...</font>

824
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,070
<font color="yellow">and I understand.</font>

825
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,740
<font color="yellow">I was duped into it by Il Jae,</font>

826
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:33,870
<font color="yellow">but I played a part in framing him for murder.</font>

827
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:43,070
<font color="yellow">Stop. You've had enough to drink.</font>

828
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,770
<font color="yellow">I'd like to be alone tonight.</font>

829
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,300
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim.</font>

830
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,040
<font color="yellow">Take her home.</font>

831
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

832
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,400
<font color="yellow">You don't have to. Look after him instead.</font>

833
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:02,340
<font color="yellow">Don't drink too much.</font>

834
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,400
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell her you have a plan B?</font>

835
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,170
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

836
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,770
<font color="yellow">what the hardest thing in the world is for me?</font>

837
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,740
<font color="yellow">It's to make a woman love me.</font>

838
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,070
<font color="yellow">I need a strategy.</font>

839
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,670
<font color="yellow">A plan to make Soo Yeon...</font>

840
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,300
<font color="yellow">side with me completely.</font>

841
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,070
<font color="yellow">It's me, Soo Yeon.</font>

842
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,570
<font color="yellow">I'd like to meet you.</font>

843
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,270
<font color="yellow">It's a bit late.</font>

844
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,970
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

845
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,770
<font color="yellow">I came to ask you for a favour.</font>

846
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,370
<font color="yellow">Go on. Any request from you is worth hearing.</font>

847
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,670
<font color="yellow">It's about Shin Young's shares of Dodo Pharmaceutical.</font>

848
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,600
<font color="yellow">Can you give them to Gun Woo?</font>

849
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,940
<font color="yellow">He feels terrible...</font>

850
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,770
<font color="yellow">for what he did to you.</font>

851
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,740
<font color="yellow">He even betrayed Il Jae, knowing what a loss it would be.</font>

852
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,310
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't have been a loss had I helped him.</font>

853
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,570
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
-  I'm a businessman.</font>

854
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,140
<font color="yellow">I do the math.</font>

855
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,870
<font color="yellow">I showed you favour...</font>

856
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:06,100
<font color="yellow">because I thought we were on the same page.</font>

857
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,840
<font color="yellow">The loss of a sibling hurts.</font>

858
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,370
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo wouldn't know, but I do.</font>

859
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,870
<font color="yellow">You're soft-hearted so I understand why you're doing this.</font>

860
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,940
<font color="yellow">But Gun Woo isn't the good man...</font>

861
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,770
<font color="yellow">you think he is.</font>

862
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,340
<font color="yellow">If you ask for such a favour again,</font>

863
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,570
<font color="yellow">I will cut all ties with you.</font>

864
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,670
<font color="yellow">I think a lot of them still want you dead.</font>

865
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,670
<font color="yellow">Guk Cheol.</font>

866
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,400
<font color="yellow">You tried to kill me...</font>

867
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,040
<font color="yellow">when I was in prison, too.</font>

868
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,150
<font color="yellow">Was it another nightmare?</font>

869
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,970
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan now tortures me in my dreams, too.</font>

870
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,820
<font color="yellow">4984, the superintendent wants to see you.</font>

871
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,060
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

872
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,570
<font color="yellow">Did you ask to be transferred?</font>

873
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,370
<font color="yellow">I did not.</font>

874
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,600
<font color="yellow">Maybe your wife did.</font>

875
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,170
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
-  I'm sorry.</font>

876
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,470
<font color="yellow">Mr Do wouldn't stop begging.</font>

877
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,470
<font color="yellow">Bring them some coffee.</font>

878
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,840
<font color="yellow">The general meeting's in two days.</font>

879
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,240
<font color="yellow">You gave your shares to Gwang Woo.</font>

880
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,840
<font color="yellow">Did you actually think I would help you?</font>

881
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:52,740
<font color="yellow">Can I release the evidence of your embezzlement?</font>

882
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,840
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

883
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,670
<font color="yellow">I have a lot on you to give to the media.</font>

884
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,740
<font color="yellow">So we both go down?</font>

885
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,370
<font color="yellow">The more you have to lose, the weaker you become.</font>

886
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,340
<font color="yellow">I'm in here, you're out there.</font>

887
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,570
<font color="yellow">Who has the upper hand?</font>

888
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,070
<font color="yellow">Let me tell you one thing.</font>

889
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,400
<font color="yellow">Even without any of your shares, in this general meeting,</font>

890
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,340
<font color="yellow">I will win.</font>

891
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:27,360
<font color="yellow">What I really want is B World.</font>

892
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,440
<font color="yellow">Your company.</font>

893
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,970
<font color="yellow">Don't even dream of it.</font>

894
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:38,070
<font color="yellow">Even if a knife's at my neck,</font>

895
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,440
<font color="yellow">I won't give it to you.</font>

896
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,340
<font color="yellow">The knife is already in your neck.</font>

897
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,140
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

898
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,370
<font color="yellow">The coffee...</font>

899
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,540
<font color="yellow">you just...</font>

900
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,240
<font color="yellow">took a sip of.</font>

901
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,740
<font color="yellow">Soon,</font>

902
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,570
<font color="yellow">you will...</font>

903
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,300
<font color="yellow">fall asleep.</font>

904
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,500
<font color="yellow">And I will have your thumbprint on every page of this contract.</font>

905
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:10,670
<font color="yellow">You can't...</font>

906
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,440
<font color="yellow">take my company with a forged document.</font>

907
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,270
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

908
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,570
<font color="yellow">not let that happen.</font>

909
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,810
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully before you pass out.</font>

910
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:27,440
<font color="yellow">You can't do anything. Why not?</font>

911
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,900
<font color="yellow">You'll be in solitary confinement tonight.</font>

912
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:35,650
<font color="yellow">While you're in there, your company will become mine.</font>

913
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:37,570
<font color="yellow">And the game will be over.</font>

914
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:39,770
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

915
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,070
<font color="yellow">You can't...</font>

916
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:49,870
<font color="yellow">Hold him down.</font>

917
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,940
<font color="yellow">You can't do this to me.</font>

918
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,140
<font color="yellow">I... I made you what you are now.</font>

919
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,440
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

920
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,700
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't have touched Soo Yeon.</font>

921
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,370
<font color="yellow">Didn't I warn you?</font>

922
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,560
<font color="yellow">I said you'd make your worst enemy.</font>

923
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,800
<font color="yellow">Do Gun Woo...</font>

924
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:41,900
<font color="yellow">You took from others all your life.</font>

925
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,940
<font color="yellow">How does it feel to lose something?</font>

926
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:48,600
<font color="yellow">Gun... Gun Woo...</font>

927
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,570
<font color="yellow">Did you pay them both?</font>

928
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,160
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

929
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,300
<font color="yellow">You can split it.</font>
