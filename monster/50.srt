67

00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,395
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

159
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,135
<font color="yellow">Which of you will go with him?</font>

160
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:15,635
<font color="yellow">I'll go, Sir.</font>

161
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,665
<font color="yellow">I think that's him.</font>

162
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:44,535
<font color="yellow">Don't get out until we're sure.</font>

163
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:52,095
<font color="yellow">I'll try to negotiate with him.</font>

164
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:53,835
<font color="yellow">Attack from behind.</font>

165
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:55,865
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir. - Good.</font>

166
00:11:57,235 --> 00:12:00,635
<font color="yellow">Don't you think we got here too soon?</font>

167
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,195
<font color="yellow">It's him.</font>

168
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:20,735
<font color="yellow">Hello. Where about are you?</font>

169
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,895
<font color="yellow">The traffic's terrible. I might be late.</font>

170
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:26,765
<font color="yellow">How much longer will you be?</font>

171
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,895
<font color="yellow">About 40 minutes?</font>

172
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:30,535
<font color="yellow">Do you have the money?</font>

173
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:31,765
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

174
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,965
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much cash I have lying around?</font>

175
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:37,535
<font color="yellow">Six million dollars is...</font>

176
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:45,695
<font color="yellow">Kang... Kang Gi Tan.</font>

177
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,935
<font color="yellow">It's over, Gwang Woo.</font>

178
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:54,365
<font color="yellow">Stop him. Get out and stop him.</font>

179
00:12:58,735 --> 00:12:59,765
<font color="yellow">Stop him!</font>

180
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:02,495
<font color="yellow">Get him!</font>

181
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:07,635
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

182
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:20,835
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

183
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:22,935
<font color="yellow">I'm absolutely fine.</font>

184
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:29,635
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

185
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:38,965
<font color="yellow">Tell me where...</font>

186
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,035
<font color="yellow">Han Sang Goo is.</font>

187
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:43,335
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

188
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:44,965
<font color="yellow">I'm crazy?</font>

189
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:47,135
<font color="yellow">Why would I tell you that?</font>

190
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,235
<font color="yellow">Turn yourself in...</font>

191
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,195
<font color="yellow">and tell everyone what you did.</font>

192
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:52,895
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

193
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:54,295
<font color="yellow">I'm giving you...</font>

194
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,865
<font color="yellow">one last chance for poor Shin Young's sake.</font>

195
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:00,295
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

196
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:01,765
<font color="yellow">Without those files,</font>

197
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,195
<font color="yellow">no one can prove anything.</font>

198
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,465
<font color="yellow">Instigating murder? Are there any witnesses?</font>

199
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:08,935
<font color="yellow">Bring me one!</font>

200
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:10,295
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

201
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:12,535
<font color="yellow">Will you not give in?</font>

202
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:16,335
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group's in pieces because of you.</font>

203
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:20,165
<font color="yellow">Isn't that good enough?</font>

204
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:21,195
<font color="yellow">Will this...</font>

205
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,535
<font color="yellow">bring back the dead?</font>

206
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:25,135
<font color="yellow">You're...</font>

207
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,595
<font color="yellow">not even human.</font>

208
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,995
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

209
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:32,595
<font color="yellow">Fight me.</font>

210
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,935
<font color="yellow">My parents are dead because of you.</font>

211
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,365
<font color="yellow">It all started with you.</font>

212
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,065
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

213
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:35,395
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

214
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:37,165
<font color="yellow">He's out cold.</font>

215
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:41,595
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

216
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:44,535
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

217
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:52,535
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

218
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:57,595
<font color="yellow">I checked his black box.</font>

219
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,965
<font color="yellow">Mr Han's at an abandoned factory 10 minutes away.</font>

220
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:01,835
<font color="yellow">Call...</font>

221
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,935
<font color="yellow">the police.</font>

222
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:05,435
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

223
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:25,595
<font color="yellow">He's taking too long.</font>

224
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:49,895
<font color="yellow">Your call has been forwarded to...</font>

225
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:54,695
<font color="yellow">I think we should go somewhere else.</font>

226
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,335
<font color="yellow">Bring him.</font>

227
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,335
<font color="yellow">Get him.</font>

228
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,765
<font color="yellow">It's the police. Get out of here.</font>

229
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,205
<font color="yellow">- Stop! - Freeze!</font>

230
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:30,495
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

231
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:39,295
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - Yes.</font>

232
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:42,095
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saving me.</font>

233
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,395
<font color="yellow">Where's the file?</font>

234
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,495
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. It's somewhere safe.</font>

235
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,865
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim told us what happened.</font>

236
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:04,705
<font color="yellow">You're lucky. It could've been worse.</font>

237
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:09,595
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise, Soo Yeon.</font>

238
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:12,735
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'm glad you're safe.</font>

239
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,895
<font color="yellow">If Mr Han has been taken away by Il Jae,</font>

240
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:24,565
<font color="yellow">that means the Pandora's Box is probably gone for good.</font>

241
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:35,335
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - I found Mr Han, Soo Yeon.</font>

242
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:38,065
<font color="yellow">Can you come now?</font>

243
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,295
<font color="yellow">Where to?</font>

244
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,835
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be there.</font>

245
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,765
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan found Mr Han.</font>

246
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,295
<font color="yellow">Then are we finally going to find the Pandora's Box?</font>

247
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:55,765
<font color="yellow">I'll go over, Gun Woo.</font>

248
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:58,035
<font color="yellow">- I'll be back. - Okay.</font>

249
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:03,205
<font color="yellow">We will finally see the end of Il Jae.</font>

250
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,365
<font color="yellow">I've had enough of him.</font>

251
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:13,135
<font color="yellow">(Charged for the murder of Go Joo Tae)</font>

252
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,595
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

253
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:27,865
<font color="yellow">The police called, and they lost Il Jae.</font>

254
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:35,465
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Soo Yeon. He'll get caught soon.</font>

255
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:38,295
<font color="yellow">First, we have to file a report to the police.</font>

256
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:40,995
<font color="yellow">I have a live broadcast tomorrow.</font>

257
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:43,935
<font color="yellow">I will reveal the truth...</font>

258
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:46,335
<font color="yellow">to the world.</font>

259
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:54,035
<font color="yellow">The truth behind the death of Sudo Hospital's directors was revealed.</font>

260
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:57,995
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh, did you finally find the evidence to prove it?</font>

261
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:02,335
<font color="yellow">Yes. We obtained a total of three voice recordings.</font>

262
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,535
<font color="yellow">Please listen to the first recording.</font>

263
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:09,705
<font color="yellow">All I will lose is just myself.</font>

264
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,335
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

265
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:15,135
<font color="yellow">People will find out Dodo Group's eldest son instigated murder.</font>

266
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:18,965
<font color="yellow">You won't just destroy yourself. You'll destroy everything...</font>

267
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:20,895
<font color="yellow">your father has spent his life to build.</font>

268
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:24,295
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to make it easier for you?</font>

269
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:27,265
<font color="yellow">Our position changed.</font>

270
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,565
<font color="yellow">I will be the one to negotiate and threat,</font>

271
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:32,665
<font color="yellow">- not you. - What is this about?</font>

272
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:36,535
<font color="yellow">Can you tell us what the situation is, Lawyer Oh?</font>

273
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:40,265
<font color="yellow">The person who instigated murder in this recording is...</font>

274
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,635
<font color="yellow">the former vice-chairman of Dodo Group, Do Gwang Woo.</font>

275
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:46,965
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

276
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,895
<font color="yellow">Is she saying that Gwang Woo instigated murder?</font>

277
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:57,395
<font color="yellow">He's currently being investigated for murder instigation.</font>

278
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:04,705
<font color="yellow">The second voice recording holds more solid evidence.</font>

279
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:06,335
<font color="yellow">Let's listen.</font>

280
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,435
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Choong Dong.</font>

281
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:12,035
<font color="yellow">No one will find the evidence that I killed the directors.</font>

282
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:15,735
<font color="yellow">Their son told the police about a possibility of a murder.</font>

283
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:22,365
<font color="yellow">No one will believe a blind kid's words.</font>

284
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:27,965
<font color="yellow">Also, Guk Cheol trusts me completely just because I'm his uncle.</font>

285
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:32,095
<font color="yellow">He can never even imagine that I could've killed his parents.</font>

286
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:37,865
<font color="yellow">The voice in this recording is...</font>

287
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:41,235
<font color="yellow">the former Seoul mayor-elect who was charged with corruption.</font>

288
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:43,595
<font color="yellow">It's Byun Il Jae.</font>

289
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:49,965
<font color="yellow">This is very shocking.</font>

290
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:53,065
<font color="yellow">It's very scary how someone like this was...</font>

291
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:54,995
<font color="yellow">elected as the mayor of Seoul.</font>

292
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:58,365
<font color="yellow">What's the last voice recording about?</font>

293
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:02,165
<font color="yellow">It's about director Jung Man Ok, who shortly took over Sudo Hospital...</font>

294
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:04,435
<font color="yellow">right after the directors' death.</font>

295
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:07,465
<font color="yellow">Hasn't the real criminal already been caught?</font>

296
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:11,635
<font color="yellow">You will see that the truth is different.</font>

297
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:15,565
<font color="yellow">If Go Joo Tae falsely claims Guk Cheol is behind all this,</font>

298
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,735
<font color="yellow">Sudo Hospital will be mine.</font>

299
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:20,465
<font color="yellow">Because Hwang Ji Soo killed Jung Man Ok,</font>

300
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,635
<font color="yellow">things just got better for us.</font>

301
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,435
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

302
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:32,065
<font color="yellow">What is he talking about?</font>

303
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:35,395
<font color="yellow">I got two things at once.</font>

304
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:39,035
<font color="yellow">I became Sudo Hospital's director and Hwang Jae Man's son-in-law.</font>

305
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:43,935
<font color="yellow">Did you really kill Jung Man Ok?</font>

306
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:48,435
<font color="yellow">Wait, is this Hwang Ji Soo...</font>

307
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:49,665
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

308
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:54,765
<font color="yellow">She's the daughter of the president-elect Hwang Jae Man.</font>

309
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:56,895
<font color="yellow">I was afraid this would happen.</font>

310
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:00,595
<font color="yellow">I didn't know she would reveal everything.</font>

311
00:23:01,065 --> 00:23:02,295
<font color="yellow">What will I do, Father?</font>

00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,895
<font color="yellow">Don't die.</font>

470
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:04,695
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

471
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:13,365
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

472
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:27,535
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

473
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:34,335
<font color="yellow">What did you do with Soo Yeon?</font>

474
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:38,435
<font color="yellow">Don't you dream that this is the end, Guk Cheol.</font>

475
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:40,265
<font color="yellow">Where's Soo Yeon?</font>

476
00:38:57,895 --> 00:39:02,035
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo, hold on. Hold on just a little more.</font>

477
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,335
<font color="yellow">Don't let go of yourself.</font>

478
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,565
<font color="yellow">I'm glad...</font>

479
00:39:13,265 --> 00:39:14,665
<font color="yellow">that I could...</font>

480
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:16,465
<font color="yellow">protect you.</font>

481
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,465
<font color="yellow">I wasn't late...</font>

482
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:22,435
<font color="yellow">like I was to my mum.</font>

483
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:26,635
<font color="yellow">Stop talking, Gun Woo.</font>

484
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:28,435
<font color="yellow">Save your energy.</font>

485
00:39:32,435 --> 00:39:33,495
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

486
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:37,435
<font color="yellow">Forget...</font>

487
00:39:39,695 --> 00:39:40,765
<font color="yellow">everything.</font>

488
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:43,535
<font color="yellow">Don't remember anything.</font>

489
00:39:49,065 --> 00:39:50,195
<font color="yellow">I don't...</font>

490
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:53,765
<font color="yellow">want you to be hurt because of me.</font>

491
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:57,665
<font color="yellow">Don't give up, Gun Woo.</font>

492
00:39:58,435 --> 00:39:59,765
<font color="yellow">You will live.</font>

493
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,065
<font color="yellow">I can't let you go like this.</font>

494
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:06,935
<font color="yellow">It's so cold.</font>

495
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:09,335
<font color="yellow">Hold me.</font>

496
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:22,665
<font color="yellow">You will live, Gun Woo.</font>

497
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:25,265
<font color="yellow">You're warm.</font>

498
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:27,935
<font color="yellow">Like...</font>

499
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:30,395
<font color="yellow">my...</font>

500
00:40:32,635 --> 00:40:33,635
<font color="yellow">mum.</font>

501
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,295
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

502
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:53,435
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

503
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:56,465
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

504
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:05,995
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

505
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:08,195
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

506
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,395
<font color="yellow">Don't die, Gun Woo.</font>

507
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:24,395
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

508
00:41:52,105 --> 00:41:53,135
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

509
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:03,995
<font color="yellow">You're wanted right now.</font>

510
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:07,765
<font color="yellow">Go to the police station to turn yourself in, not here.</font>

511
00:42:10,765 --> 00:42:11,835
<font color="yellow">Let me...</font>

512
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:16,765
<font color="yellow">stand as a witness for Dong Soo's murder case.</font>

513
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:25,535
<font color="yellow">I'm very sorry.</font>

514
00:42:40,995 --> 00:42:42,265
<font color="yellow">I, Hwang Ji Soo,</font>

515
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,605
<font color="yellow">accidently murdered...</font>

516
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,235
<font color="yellow">the former director of Sudo Hospital...</font>

517
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:51,995
<font color="yellow">Jung Man Ok back in 2006.</font>

518
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,965
<font color="yellow">I deeply regret my action...</font>

519
00:42:55,335 --> 00:42:56,695
<font color="yellow">and I put down everything...</font>

520
00:42:56,995 --> 00:43:00,435
<font color="yellow">as the daughter of the president and as a congresswoman.</font>

521
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:22,965
<font color="yellow">So, why did you want to see me?</font>

522
00:43:25,195 --> 00:43:27,935
<font color="yellow">Il Jae's final trial will be held soon.</font>

523
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:32,495
<font color="yellow">He was already sentenced to life in prison.</font>

524
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:38,105
<font color="yellow">His sentence won't be reduced. Do not worry.</font>

525
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:42,035
<font color="yellow">Give him a death penalty.</font>

526
00:43:45,835 --> 00:43:49,135
<font color="yellow">The ruling will be given by the judge.</font>

527
00:43:50,435 --> 00:43:52,765
<font color="yellow">It's not for the president to interfere.</font>

528
00:43:53,995 --> 00:43:58,295
<font color="yellow">It's not fair for Il Jae to live. Both legally and morally.</font>

529
00:44:00,465 --> 00:44:03,665
<font color="yellow">I understand what you're saying.</font>

530
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:05,365
<font color="yellow">There is one more thing.</font>

531
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:11,265
<font color="yellow">You must execute him while you are still in your office.</font>

532
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:18,695
<font color="yellow">This is the first and the last request I make to you, President.</font>

533
00:44:25,465 --> 00:44:26,595
<font color="yellow">Breaking news.</font>

534
00:44:26,835 --> 00:44:30,365
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae, the criminal behind death of Sudo Hospital's director,</font>

535
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:34,635
<font color="yellow">Cha Dong Soo and Do Gun Woo was just sentenced with a death penalty.</font>

536
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:44,765
<font color="yellow">Did you think I'd rot in prison forever? You're wrong, Guk Cheol.</font>

537
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:48,035
<font color="yellow">You will be executed.</font>

538
00:44:49,335 --> 00:44:50,765
<font color="yellow">Nonsense.</font>

539
00:44:51,095 --> 00:44:54,065
<font color="yellow">No one has been executed over the last 20 years.</font>

540
00:44:54,335 --> 00:44:56,235
<font color="yellow">The president promised me.</font>

541
00:44:57,565 --> 00:44:59,535
<font color="yellow">He will execute you.</font>

542
00:45:02,295 --> 00:45:04,065
<font color="yellow">You must be scared of death.</font>

543
00:45:05,165 --> 00:45:08,695
<font color="yellow">I thought so. You've committed many crimes.</font>

544
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:12,335
<font color="yellow">If you get meat in your soup,</font>

545
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:15,765
<font color="yellow">that means it's your last meal.</font>

546
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:24,535
<font color="yellow">Do not think about visiting me at the prison, Guk Cheol.</font>

547
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:26,665
<font color="yellow">Don't repent.</font>

548
00:45:28,235 --> 00:45:30,565
<font color="yellow">That way, you'll be punished properly.</font>

549
00:45:35,095 --> 00:45:38,165
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. - Cheers.</font>

550
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,035
<font color="yellow">Isn't our party way too small?</font>

551
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:47,565
<font color="yellow">Come on, this can't be the end.</font>

552
00:45:48,135 --> 00:45:49,535
<font color="yellow">Do we have something else?</font>

553
00:45:51,735 --> 00:45:52,735
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

554
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:55,195
<font color="yellow">something to tell you.</font>

555
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:01,165
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon, what was your dream?</font>

556
00:46:02,365 --> 00:46:06,165
<font color="yellow">It wasn't anything big. I spent my youth in Dodo Group...</font>

557
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:07,335
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group...</font>

558
00:46:08,295 --> 00:46:09,665
<font color="yellow">will be yours, Mr Moon.</font>

559
00:46:11,695 --> 00:46:14,595
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - Please be the chairman.</font>

560
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:21,495
<font color="yellow">That's your position.</font>

561
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:22,695
<font color="yellow">I'm sure...</font>

562
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:25,365
<font color="yellow">you'll do a much better job.</font>

563
00:46:27,295 --> 00:46:30,295
<font color="yellow">But still, Miss Do is here, too.</font>

564
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:34,695
<font color="yellow">I don't care about the company. You can take care of it.</font>

565
00:46:38,635 --> 00:46:39,635
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung.</font>

566
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:41,965
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

567
00:46:42,035 --> 00:46:43,065
<font color="yellow">Huaping...</font>

568
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,295
<font color="yellow">is yours.</font>

569
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:49,135
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

570
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:53,035
<font color="yellow">Don't call me boss. You're the boss from now on.</font>

571
00:46:56,295 --> 00:46:59,565
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this, Sir?</font>

572
00:47:00,635 --> 00:47:01,635
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

573
00:47:02,535 --> 00:47:03,835
<font color="yellow">Let's make a toast.</font>

574
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:41,595
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak. What time did you say Soo Yeon's flight was?</font>

575
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:46,765
<font color="yellow">Will you really never return to Korea?</font>

576
00:47:48,995 --> 00:47:50,695
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

577
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,595
<font color="yellow">You too, Nan Jeong.</font>

578
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:55,365
<font color="yellow">Can we visit you in Germany?</font>

579
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,295
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'll call you often.</font>

580
00:47:58,535 --> 00:48:00,635
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Can you even speak German?</font>

581
00:48:00,935 --> 00:48:01,935
<font color="yellow">Bonjour?</font>

582
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:07,535
<font color="yellow">Go on. You'll be late. Give us a call, okay?</font>

583
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,165
<font color="yellow">- Sir, please give us a hand. - I'm fine.</font>

584
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:12,295
<font color="yellow">- I can do it. - No. Sir, please take this.</font>

585
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,165
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you go and talk to her?</font>

586
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:23,165
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

587
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:26,895
<font color="yellow">hold her back.</font>

588
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:55,535
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon's face...</font>

589
00:48:56,695 --> 00:48:58,135
<font color="yellow">was the last thing...</font>

590
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:00,665
<font color="yellow">I saw.</font>

591
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:08,765
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group's Do Gwang Woo who was jailed for instigating murder...</font>

592
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:11,265
<font color="yellow">was pardoned by the president after two years.</font>

593
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:15,535
<font color="yellow">His sister Do Shin Young...</font>

594
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:19,065
<font color="yellow">will receive the Swiss International Volunteer Award.</font>

595
00:49:19,865 --> 00:49:23,395
<font color="yellow">She has been travelling Africa for the past two years...</font>

596
00:49:23,395 --> 00:49:26,665
<font color="yellow">to care for orphans who lost parents in wars.</font>

597
00:49:37,835 --> 00:49:38,895
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

598
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:41,995
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae will be hanged today.</font>

599
00:50:14,635 --> 00:50:19,035
<font color="yellow">If you get meat in your soup, that means it's your last meal.</font>

600
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,365
<font color="yellow">4529, come out.</font>

601
00:50:34,935 --> 00:50:36,635
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

602
00:50:36,635 --> 00:50:37,835
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

603
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,565
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

604
00:50:50,265 --> 00:50:52,435
<font color="yellow">No! Let me go!</font>

605
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:54,565
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

606
00:51:01,035 --> 00:51:03,335
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Let me live.</font>

607
00:51:03,335 --> 00:51:05,765
<font color="yellow">Don't kill me. I want to live.</font>

608
00:51:43,295 --> 00:51:47,065
<font color="yellow">Honey, it's Gwang Woo's first meal at home.</font>

609
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:48,965
<font color="yellow">You should do it.</font>

610
00:51:49,335 --> 00:51:51,195
<font color="yellow">Let's stick to the ritual.</font>

611
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:54,235
<font color="yellow">You do it.</font>

612
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:56,935
<font color="yellow">You do it.</font>

613
00:51:58,395 --> 00:52:00,865
<font color="yellow">I want you to do it.</font>

614
00:52:01,235 --> 00:52:05,965
<font color="yellow">What... What are we going to do?</font>

615
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,495
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

616
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:10,065
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

617
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:11,895
<font color="yellow">He...</font>

618
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:14,765
<font color="yellow">has a lot to repent.</font>

619
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,535
<font color="yellow">It will take some time.</font>

620
00:52:20,565 --> 00:52:23,635
<font color="yellow">What? Repent?</font>

621
00:52:24,735 --> 00:52:25,865
<font color="yellow">Bok Shin.</font>

622
00:52:26,295 --> 00:52:29,765
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - See if he opens his eyes.</font>

623
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:33,465
<font color="yellow">Let's pray.</font>

624
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:44,435
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the food you blessed us with.</font>

625
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:46,595
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

626
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:49,695
<font color="yellow">Am... Amen.</font>

627
00:52:50,595 --> 00:52:53,495
<font color="yellow">You don't say that yet.</font>

628
00:52:55,995 --> 00:52:58,895
<font color="yellow">I pray that my family...</font>

629
00:52:59,365 --> 00:53:01,965
<font color="yellow">does not sin or commit a crime.</font>

630
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:04,165
<font color="yellow">Dear God.</font>

631
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:08,165
<font color="yellow">Please look down upon us.</font>

632
00:53:08,865 --> 00:53:13,435
<font color="yellow">I beg of you with all my heart.</font>

633
00:53:13,595 --> 00:53:15,195
<font color="yellow">The chairman is here.</font>

634
00:53:23,235 --> 00:53:26,665
<font color="yellow">Tell them not to greet me like this any more.</font>

635
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:28,635
<font color="yellow">- It's old-fashioned. - Yes, Sir.</font>

636
00:53:30,065 --> 00:53:34,465
<font color="yellow">Sir. Soo Yeon just flew in today.</font>

637
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:39,735
<font color="yellow">I think she flew back to mourn Gun Woo.</font>

638
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:42,165
<font color="yellow">Where is she now?</font>

639
00:53:50,635 --> 00:53:54,435
<font color="yellow">(Do Gun Woo)</font>

640
00:54:20,435 --> 00:54:22,065
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

641
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:25,995
<font color="yellow">Have you heard about Mr Kang?</font>

642
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,495
<font color="yellow">I heard that he went blind.</font>

643
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:33,765
<font color="yellow">He's scheduled for surgery to extract the bullet.</font>

644
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:36,065
<font color="yellow">Surgery?</font>

645
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,165
<font color="yellow">He'll live less than a year if he doesn't have the surgery.</font>

646
00:54:38,965 --> 00:54:42,095
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say the survival rate was very low?</font>

647
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:43,595
<font color="yellow">It was two years ago.</font>

648
00:54:44,265 --> 00:54:47,435
<font color="yellow">Doctor Campbell said the success rate is 30 percent.</font>

649
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:51,665
<font color="yellow">That means there's a 70-percent chance he'll die.</font>

650
00:54:54,195 --> 00:54:57,765
<font color="yellow">I was hoping you could stay with him until the surgery.</font>

651
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:01,765
<font color="yellow">He doesn't say so,</font>

652
00:55:03,035 --> 00:55:04,995
<font color="yellow">but he still misses you.</font>

653
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:08,295
<font color="yellow">Please, Lawyer Oh.</font>

654
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:12,895
<font color="yellow">He can't go a day without painkillers.</font>

655
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:16,095
<font color="yellow">I know him well.</font>

656
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,065
<font color="yellow">He won't...</font>

657
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:20,595
<font color="yellow">want me to see him like that.</font>

658
00:55:21,495 --> 00:55:24,435
<font color="yellow">That's what bothers me.</font>

659
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:29,965
<font color="yellow">There is a way.</font>

660
00:56:22,065 --> 00:56:23,895
<font color="yellow">Welcome, Chairman Moon.</font>

661
00:56:23,895 --> 00:56:25,335
<font color="yellow">You're still the same.</font>

662
00:56:27,895 --> 00:56:29,435
<font color="yellow">Thanks for coming, Soo Yeon.</font>

663
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,765
<font color="yellow">Where's Gi Tan?</font>

664
00:56:39,265 --> 00:56:42,665
<font color="yellow">This house used to be Guk Cheol's.</font>

665
00:56:43,335 --> 00:56:45,565
<font color="yellow">He bought it back.</font>

666
00:56:46,135 --> 00:56:47,565
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this?</font>

667
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:50,165
<font color="yellow">He's a tough man to cheat.</font>

668
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:53,895
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine as long as he is.</font>

669
00:56:56,535 --> 00:56:58,435
<font color="yellow">I might die.</font>

670
00:56:59,635 --> 00:57:01,465
<font color="yellow">It'll hurt you more.</font>

671
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:04,035
<font color="yellow">Why did you come back?</font>

672
00:57:18,695 --> 00:57:20,065
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

673
00:57:21,995 --> 00:57:23,565
<font color="yellow">Welcome, Chairman Moon.</font>

674
00:57:25,035 --> 00:57:27,535
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group's doing pretty well.</font>

675
00:57:28,665 --> 00:57:30,165
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, Sir.</font>

676
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:33,435
<font color="yellow">I hired you a new maid.</font>

677
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:38,635
<font color="yellow">She's smart and hard-working.</font>

678
00:57:38,895 --> 00:57:41,035
<font color="yellow">Her name is Yeon Mi Jeong and she's...</font>

679
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,665
<font color="yellow">I don't like her name.</font>

680
00:57:43,695 --> 00:57:44,835
<font color="yellow">Send her away.</font>

681
00:57:49,235 --> 00:57:52,765
<font color="yellow">She can't speak. She won't get on your nerves.</font>

682
00:57:59,835 --> 00:58:00,995
<font color="yellow">Ms Yeon.</font>

683
00:58:03,535 --> 00:58:04,935
<font color="yellow">I'm very picky.</font>

684
00:58:06,035 --> 00:58:07,835
<font color="yellow">Three warnings and you're out.</font>

685
00:59:02,865 --> 00:59:03,865
<font color="yellow">Ms Yeon.</font>

686
00:59:05,465 --> 00:59:07,235
<font color="yellow">Don't treat me like a patient.</font>

687
00:59:09,095 --> 00:59:10,135
<font color="yellow">That's one warning.</font>

688
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:27,765
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me.</font>

689
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:31,295
<font color="yellow">That's two warnings.</font>

690
00:59:54,735 --> 00:59:55,765
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

691
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:57,495
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

692
00:59:58,165 --> 00:59:59,235
<font color="yellow">Move your face.</font>

693
01:00:04,135 --> 01:00:05,135
<font color="yellow">Three warnings.</font>

694
01:00:05,765 --> 01:00:06,765
<font color="yellow">You're fired.</font>

695
01:00:17,935 --> 01:00:20,335
<font color="yellow">It's time to leave for the hospital.</font>

696
01:00:20,665 --> 01:00:22,495
<font color="yellow">I just fired Ms Yeon.</font>

697
01:00:28,395 --> 01:00:30,295
<font color="yellow">Very well, Sir.</font>

698
01:00:30,765 --> 01:00:31,765
<font color="yellow">Come with me, Sir.</font>

699
01:00:47,495 --> 01:00:48,665
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Soo Yeon.</font>

700
01:00:50,095 --> 01:00:51,095
<font color="yellow">I don't want you...</font>

701
01:00:52,735 --> 01:00:54,695
<font color="yellow">to hurt because of me.</font>

702
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:57,495
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

703
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:19,565
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

704
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:23,495
<font color="yellow">You're so silly.</font>

705
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:27,165
<font color="yellow">Did you think...</font>

706
01:01:29,335 --> 01:01:31,095
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't recognise you?</font>

707
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:37,395
<font color="yellow">Guk Cheol.</font>

708
01:01:44,195 --> 01:01:45,695
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting.</font>

709
01:01:50,765 --> 01:01:52,535
<font color="yellow">Come back alive.</font>

710
01:01:55,665 --> 01:01:56,765
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

711
01:01:59,765 --> 01:02:00,765
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

712
01:03:01,035 --> 01:03:02,035
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

713
01:03:07,865 --> 01:03:09,565
<font color="yellow">(Thank you for watching Monster.)</font>
