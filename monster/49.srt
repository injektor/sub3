<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

3
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:13,843
<font color="yellow">Is this Kang Gi Tan?</font>

4
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:15,613
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

5
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:18,073
<font color="yellow">You want the Pandora's Box.</font>

6
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:20,643
<font color="yellow">I have it.</font>

7
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:24,713
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

8
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:27,913
<font color="yellow">Let's meet right now.</font>

9
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:30,613
<font color="yellow">You said you would give me three million dollars.</font>

10
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:33,113
<font color="yellow">Can you give me five million?</font>

11
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,173
<font color="yellow">If you hand me that box,</font>

12
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:37,713
<font color="yellow">I'll give you whatever you want.</font>

13
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,513
<font color="yellow">I need some more time.</font>

14
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:45,213
<font color="yellow">I'll call you again.</font>

15
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,413
<font color="yellow">Wait. Hello? Hello?</font>

16
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:53,543
<font color="yellow">Was that the informant?</font>

17
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:55,213
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

18
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:18,673
<font color="yellow">The two top presidential candidates for this election, Hwang Jae Man...</font>

19
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:23,643
<font color="yellow">and Eo Gyeong Seok are revealing shocking stories about each other.</font>

20
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,143
<font color="yellow">The nation is in deep shock over these scandals.</font>

21
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:33,243
<font color="yellow">They both claim these scandals are false propaganda by the other,</font>

22
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:36,313
<font color="yellow">and will not cease running for presidency.</font>

23
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:39,743
<font color="yellow">On the other hand, the prosecution will...</font>

24
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:42,313
<font color="yellow">conduct an investigation...</font>

25
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:44,873
<font color="yellow">on Mr Eo and Mr Hwang's scandals...</font>

26
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:47,143
<font color="yellow">after the presidential election is over.</font>

27
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:50,573
<font color="yellow">Hence, there is much attention on the result of this election.</font>

28
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:59,613
<font color="yellow">You have to go vote early tomorrow. Stop drinking, Father.</font>

29
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:06,843
<font color="yellow">How's the public sentiment?</font>

30
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:09,983
<font color="yellow">It looks like people will vote...</font>

31
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:13,713
<font color="yellow">for the third in line instead of Mr Eo and you.</font>

32
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,573
<font color="yellow">Il Jae.</font>

33
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:22,743
<font color="yellow">I can't believe he stabbed me in the back at the last minute.</font>

34
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,773
<font color="yellow">I told you to never trust him.</font>

35
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:28,413
<font color="yellow">Everything depends...</font>

36
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:31,913
<font color="yellow">on the result of the election tomorrow.</font>

37
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:34,173
<font color="yellow">If I fail,</font>

38
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:37,073
<font color="yellow">I probably can't avoid...</font>

39
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:39,173
<font color="yellow">the prosecution investigation.</font>

40
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:42,643
<font color="yellow">One good thing is that people are focused more...</font>

41
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:45,473
<font color="yellow">on Mr Eo's sex scandal rather than your lobby.</font>

42
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:49,973
<font color="yellow">Whether I get elected or not,</font>

43
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:52,643
<font color="yellow">I will make sure...</font>

44
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:54,343
<font color="yellow">to destroy Il Jae...</font>

45
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:57,543
<font color="yellow">with my own hands.</font>

46
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:07,013
<font color="yellow">If Mr Eo doesn't get elected, Gi Tan will take over the company.</font>

47
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:08,273
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

48
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:12,043
<font color="yellow">We have to wait for the result.</font>

49
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:14,113
<font color="yellow">It's too early to feel defeated.</font>

50
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,443
<font color="yellow">I can already see how it will go.</font>

51
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,443
<font color="yellow">Are you blind?</font>

52
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:20,913
<font color="yellow">That's too much, Gun Woo.</font>

53
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:21,973
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

54
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:24,273
<font color="yellow">What? Are you kidding me?</font>

55
00:03:24,443 --> 00:03:25,743

59
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:41,243

61

65
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:21,973
<font color="yellow">Things aren't looking great, so you can be angry and you can blame me.</font>

66
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:24,913
<font color="yellow">But Gun Woo,</font>

132

149

<font color="yellow">He came to see me first...</font>

150
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,873

155
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:50,913
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll keep watching.</font>

156
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:57,043
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

157
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,373

00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:02,013
<font color="yellow">Did Il Jae tell you to tail Soo Yeon around?</font>

159
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:05,443
<font color="yellow">This is a nice car.</font>

160
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:08,713
<font color="yellow">Wow. How much does a car like this cost?</font>

161
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:12,273
<font color="yellow">Have you had lunch yet?</font>

162
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,343
<font color="yellow">Get off.</font>

163
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:17,473
<font color="yellow">Sure. We all do different things to make a living.</font>

164

167
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:28,313
<font color="yellow">You ate so well in jail.</font>

168
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,743
<font color="yellow">It's just a meal. Why not just eat together?</font>

171

<font color="yellow">When the informant shows up,</font>

172
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:55,873

173

174
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:02,473
<font color="yellow">What chance?</font>

175
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:04,873
<font color="yellow">A chance to be forgiven...</font>

176
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:06,573
<font color="yellow">for all the crimes you committed for him.</font>

177
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,143
<font color="yellow">Enough nonsense. You can't fool me.</font>

178
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:11,213
<font color="yellow">You need to wake up.</font>

179
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,773
<font color="yellow">Il Jae will be pushed to the end of the cliff.</font>

180
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,843
<font color="yellow">Do you plan on jumping off with him?</font>

181
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:19,473
<font color="yellow">No, don't do that.</font>

182

<font color="yellow">Is she well?</font>

184
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,273
<font color="yellow">Why did Il Jae order you to shadow me?</font>

185
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:29,773
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

186
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:32,573
<font color="yellow">Then did he tell you to kidnap me?</font>

187
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:39,813
<font color="yellow">No way, he wouldn't do that.</font>

188
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:43,213
<font color="yellow">This is bad table manner.</font>

189
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,343
<font color="yellow">Here, finish it. The noodles are getting cold.</font>

190
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:47,413
<font color="yellow">I'm finished.</font>

191
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:51,043
<font color="yellow">Choong Dong.</font>

192
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:53,843

193
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:59,543

195
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:03,473
<font color="yellow">Finish this before you go.</font>

196
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,713
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

197
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:10,643

198
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,373
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

199
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:14,643
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

200
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:19,513
<font color="yellow">Did you see those eyes? He gives me the chills.</font>

201
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:23,713
<font color="yellow">Are you sure there's something we can get from him?</font>

202
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:25,943
<font color="yellow">It'd be over if we can find the informant.</font>

203
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:28,943
<font color="yellow">No one else would know...</font>

204
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:31,343
<font color="yellow">better than him.</font>

205
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:35,813
<font color="yellow">That's true. If he comes to our side,</font>

206
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:38,673
<font color="yellow">Il Jae would spend the rest of his life in jail...</font>

207
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:40,473
<font color="yellow">at the least.</font>

208
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,873
<font color="yellow">He's like a VIP to us.</font>

209
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:48,343
<font color="yellow">That's why I said we should have ordered something expensive.</font>

210
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:50,643
<font color="yellow">How can we order it when we don't have money?</font>

211
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:52,413
<font color="yellow">We can order with the business credit card.</font>

212
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:00,073
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

213

215
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,513

<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

231

<font color="yellow">I gave it to Il Jae.</font>

232

<font color="yellow">Even if it's for our company,</font>

234

<font color="yellow">Yes, I gave him an update.</font>

237

<font color="yellow">No. You'd never use it.</font>

256
00:17:20,513 --> 00:17:23,143
<font color="yellow">Just give it to me.</font>

257

<font color="yellow">Are you?</font>

312
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:53,443
<font color="yellow">It's time for the press conference, President.</font>

313
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,013
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

314
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:58,813
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

315
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:00,813
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

316
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:07,313
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Are you going blind again?</font>

317
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:11,583
<font color="yellow">No. I'm fine now.</font>

318
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:14,213
<font color="yellow">We should go to a hospital and get a thorough checkup.</font>

319
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,773
<font color="yellow">Before that,</font>

320
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,713
<font color="yellow">I wonder how Il Jae is.</font>

321
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:21,273
<font color="yellow">I'll look for him.</font>

322
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:27,643
<font color="yellow">We told everyone about his corruption.</font>

323
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:31,583
<font color="yellow">I can't believe over 40 percent of the people still voted for him.</font>

324
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:35,473
<font color="yellow">They're probably indifferent because there are so many corruptions.</font>

325
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,873
<font color="yellow">I hope this isn't a choice we will regret.</font>

326
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:48,313
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

327
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,673
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk back to me?</font>

328
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:52,513
<font color="yellow">Do I look like an idiot to you?

329
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:53,973
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

330
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:55,743
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

331
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:59,313
<font color="yellow">Do I look like an idiot to you, too?</font>

332
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:00,873
<font color="yellow">What is with you, Sir?</font>

333
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:04,143
<font color="yellow">I don't need any of you. If you want to leave, leave.</font>

334
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:06,113
<font color="yellow">Please stop, Sir.</font>

335
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:15,013
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

336
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:20,613
<font color="yellow">Are you here to mock me?</font>

337
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:24,673
<font color="yellow">I was, but I don't think that's necessary.</font>

338
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,743
<font color="yellow">I don't need to name you anything when you've made a mess of yourself.</font>

339
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:28,743
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

340
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:30,243
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed, Uncle.</font>

341
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:33,773
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be planning a revenge against me.</font>

342
00:22:34,273 --> 00:22:35,273
<font color="yellow">But look at you.</font>

343
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:37,473
<font color="yellow">You're just a loser.</font>

344
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:40,713
<font color="yellow">He is a loser, Chairman.</font>

345
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:45,273
<font color="yellow">His slush fund is taken away, and the president despises him.</font>

346
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,573
<font color="yellow">He's worse than a loser.</font>

347
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:48,013
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

348
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:52,313
<font color="yellow">You are amazing, Guk Cheol.</font>

349
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:54,113
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

350
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,973
<font color="yellow">getting a revenge won't bring your parents back alive.</font>

351
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:04,513
<font color="yellow">You'll see your parents only once you die.</font>

352
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:05,973
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

353
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:09,143
<font color="yellow">That means you can't ever win...</font>

354
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,543
<font color="yellow">no matter what you do.</font>

355
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:18,413
<font color="yellow">Everyone you ever loved are all dead.</font>

356
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:20,573
<font color="yellow">They are all rotting six feet under.</font>

357
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:24,943
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

358
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:26,573
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

359
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,873
<font color="yellow">Do you both want to die?</font>

360
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:31,043
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

361
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:44,073
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't play around with this.</font>

362
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:48,013
<font color="yellow">If you do, you'll probably get ripped in pieces.</font>

363
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,143
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

364
00:23:57,073 --> 00:23:59,943
<font color="yellow">I will use all lawful means to give you a death penalty.</font>

365
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,073
<font color="yellow">Remember what I said when you die on the gallows.</font>

366
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,513
<font color="yellow">Death won't be the end for you.</font>

367
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:13,373
<font color="yellow">You will drop down to a pit of fire when you die, Il Jae.</font>

368
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,243
<font color="yellow">- Calm down... - Let go.</font>

369
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:37,573
<font color="yellow">Let's see who will go...</font>

370
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:42,243
<font color="yellow">down the pit, Guk Cheol.</font>

371
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:50,773
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

372
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:51,943
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chairman.</font>

373
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:54,273
<font color="yellow">Take out all matured bonds from Dodo Group tomorrow.</font>

374
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:56,673
<font color="yellow">It must be Gun Woo's turn.</font>

375
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,673
<font color="yellow">Call every single president of the banks...</font>

376
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:01,643
<font color="yellow">that are doing business with Dodo Group right now.</font>

377
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:03,273
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

378
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:15,813
<font color="yellow">What has Mr Gong been doing?</font>

379
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:18,343
<font color="yellow">Look at your toenails.</font>

380
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:22,813
<font color="yellow">Isn't it great to have me cut your toenails?</font>

381
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:24,843
<font color="yellow">No, it isn't.</font>

382
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:27,743
<font color="yellow">Stop it, woman.</font>

383
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:34,243
<font color="yellow">You used to pester me, asking to clip your nails...</font>

384
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:36,973
<font color="yellow">and to clean your ears.</font>

385
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:42,443
<font color="yellow">Back then,</font>

386
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:47,243
<font color="yellow">we lived in a small house but those were the good times.</font>

387
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,943
<font color="yellow">You never came back home empty-handed.</font>

388
00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:58,773
<font color="yellow">You always brought home my favourite street snacks.</font>

389
00:25:59,213 --> 00:26:02,243
<font color="yellow">I think those were the happiest days of my life.</font>

390
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:06,713
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd love only me forever.</font>

391
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:12,243
<font color="yellow">How did we end up like this?</font>

392
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:14,143
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

393
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:17,073
<font color="yellow">We lived a crazy life,</font>

394
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:20,113
<font color="yellow">and what we lost wasn't just our time.</font>

395
00:26:23,673 --> 00:26:25,473
<font color="yellow">We still have a chance.</font>

396
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:28,043
<font color="yellow">We can still go back to those times.</font>

397
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:30,243
<font color="yellow">I won't be greedy.</font>

398
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:33,913
<font color="yellow">I'll live the rest of my life taking care of you.</font>

399
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:38,713
<font color="yellow">So please give Gwang Woo one of our subsidiaries.</font>

400
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:44,943
<font color="yellow">For me, I'll be satisfied if you give me...</font>

401
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:49,313
<font color="yellow">either Dodo Fashion or something in media.</font>

402
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:53,143
<font color="yellow">We can be happy again like our old times, Honey.</font>

403
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,313
<font color="yellow">This is why we have grown far away from each other.</font>

404
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,843
<font color="yellow">Because of your greediness.</font>

405
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:09,513
<font color="yellow">Your beard...</font>

406
00:27:10,273 --> 00:27:13,313
<font color="yellow">has grown quite a lot.</font>

407
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:16,243
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to shave you?</font>

408
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,743
<font color="yellow">What? No, thanks.</font>

409
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:22,273
<font color="yellow">I never had a beard.</font>

410
00:27:30,743 --> 00:27:34,613
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja, don't do this. Please.</font>

411
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:35,973
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

412
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,543
<font color="yellow">Why are you so stiffened up?</font>

413
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:43,143
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid that I'll make a cut?</font>

414
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:45,413
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

415
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:46,573
<font color="yellow">I used...</font>

416
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:49,213
<font color="yellow">to work at a barbershop before I met...</font>

417
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:53,613
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

418
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:57,813
<font color="yellow">Did you also work at a barbershop and not just a factory?</font>

419
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:04,143
<font color="yellow">I used to shave my father all the time when I was young.</font>

420
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,913
<font color="yellow">Chairman, we're in trouble.</font>

421
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:13,113
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group has gone bankrupt.</font>

422
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:15,273
<font color="yellow">What do you mean it's bankrupt?</font>

423
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:17,243
<font color="yellow">My goodness...</font>

424
00:28:17,243 --> 00:28:18,543
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, Honey.</font>

425
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:21,073
<font color="yellow">Give me a tissue right now.</font>

426
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:22,813
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

427
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:32,743
<font color="yellow">What do you mean bankrupt? What are you talking about?</font>

428
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:37,343
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is the chairman's office.</font>

429
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:40,113
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

430
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:43,573
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to us now?</font>

431
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:45,413
<font color="yellow">What do you mean pay back the loan right now?</font>

432
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:47,613
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Sir!</font>

433
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:49,573
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

434
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:54,273
<font color="yellow">I don't think this is something to discuss over the phone.</font>

435
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:55,443
<font color="yellow">Let's meet in person.</font>

436
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,713
<font color="yellow">Please hold on for a moment.</font>

437
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:59,043
<font color="yellow">It's BC Bank.</font>

438
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:01,843
<font color="yellow">If you won't meet, what do you expect me to do?</font>

439
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,513
<font color="yellow">We'll give you a call back.</font>

440
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,343
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want.</font>

441
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:10,073
<font color="yellow">BC Bank is requesting that we pay them back as well.</font>

442
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,443
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is the chairman's office.</font>

443
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:25,113
<font color="yellow">Although we're bankrupt,</font>

444
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:28,543
<font color="yellow">it's strange that all of the banks are requesting to pay back.</font>

445
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:30,243
<font color="yellow">It's Kang Gi Tan.</font>

446
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:31,943
<font color="yellow">He's controlling it all.</font>

447
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:35,343
<font color="yellow">An emergency creditors' meeting will be held this afternoon.</font>

448
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,143
<font color="yellow">This is what we feared.</font>

449
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:41,743
<font color="yellow">What happened to filing for legal management?</font>

450
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:42,943
<font color="yellow">The documents are all ready.</font>

451
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:45,443
<font color="yellow">- Get it registered at the court. - Yes, Sir.</font>

452
00:29:47,713 --> 00:29:49,213
<font color="yellow">Come if you dare, Kang Gi Tan.</font>

453
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:51,873
<font color="yellow">I'll fight you until the end.</font>

454
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:03,143
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo filed for legal management.</font>

455
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:07,373
<font color="yellow">Then what happens now?</font>

456
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:10,643
<font color="yellow">He's trying to stop us from exercising credit to earn time.</font>

457
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,143
<font color="yellow">He wants to put up a fight?</font>

458
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:14,313
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

459
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,543
<font color="yellow">we'll see how far he goes.</font>

460
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:20,813
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group's secretary called and asked you...</font>

461
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:23,213
<font color="yellow">to join for the creditors' meeting.</font>

462
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,143
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel,</font>

463
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:30,113
<font color="yellow">but you must separate work from your personal life.</font>

464
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:34,143
<font color="yellow">You're their legal advisor. You must go.</font>

465
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:40,013
<font color="yellow">This is my resignation letter.</font>

466
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:42,413
<font color="yellow">Are you going to quit being their legal advisor?</font>

467
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:44,143
<font color="yellow">Please hand this in for me.</font>

468
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:48,913
<font color="yellow">I want you to take over instead for the time being.</font>

469
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:52,343
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

470
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:55,413
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

471
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:07,473
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, is it over with Chairman Do?</font>

472
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,613
<font color="yellow">What do you mean legal management?</font>

473
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,673
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to avoid loan waiver?</font>

474
00:31:28,673 --> 00:31:30,343
<font color="yellow">That's a little harsh.</font>

475
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:32,843
<font color="yellow">Please do not dishonour Dodo Group's name.</font>

476
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:35,573
<font color="yellow">Dishonour?</font>

477
00:31:35,713 --> 00:31:37,973
<font color="yellow">You're bankrupt. Why does that matter right now?</font>

478
00:31:39,843 --> 00:31:43,213
<font color="yellow">I'll soon be announcing my plan to revive the company.</font>

479
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:46,543
<font color="yellow">I'll pay all the creditors back, so please do not worry.</font>

480
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:47,873
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do.</font>

481
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:51,513
<font color="yellow">You forgot one thing.</font>

482
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:54,613
<font color="yellow">Why are you hiding the fact...</font>

483
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,113
<font color="yellow">that all of the banks requested you...</font>

484
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:58,973
<font color="yellow">to pay back the loans at once?</font>

485
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:04,213
<font color="yellow">Is this true?</font>

486
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:08,673
<font color="yellow">Why don't you answer this question yourself...</font>

487
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:11,773
<font color="yellow">since you're the one that persuaded the banks?</font>

488
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,673
<font color="yellow">Instead of watering a rotten tree,</font>

489
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:17,943
<font color="yellow">I prefer to pull it out and planting a new tree.</font>

490
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:21,213
<font color="yellow">You're the one that made this tree rot.</font>

491
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:24,373
<font color="yellow">So you agree that it's rotten?</font>

492
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:30,313
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do Choong is here.</font>

493
00:32:34,143 --> 00:32:37,143
<font color="yellow">(Dodo Group)</font>

494
00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:40,773
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

495
00:32:47,243 --> 00:32:49,743
<font color="yellow">Since the chairman is still ill,</font>

496
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,573
<font color="yellow">I will be relaying his messages.</font>

497
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,213
<font color="yellow">He's asking for you...</font>

498
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:04,313
<font color="yellow">to put your trust in him once more...</font>

499
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:06,773
<font color="yellow">and to extend the mature bonds.</font>

500
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:17,113
<font color="yellow">I decline.</font>

501
00:33:19,143 --> 00:33:20,973
<font color="yellow">Even if the chairman asks me,</font>

502
00:33:21,573 --> 00:33:23,143
<font color="yellow">I cannot extend it any more.</font>

503
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:31,443
<font color="yellow">He would like to...</font>

504
00:33:31,873 --> 00:33:34,443
<font color="yellow">speak to you in private.</font>

505
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:53,943
<font color="yellow">Can we talk, Shin Young?</font>

506
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:57,713
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting in the lobby.</font>

507
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:08,613
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? You're not a creditor.</font>

508
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,843
<font color="yellow">What do you think...</font>

509
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:13,313
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan will talk to Father about?</font>

510
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:15,013
<font color="yellow">What's your intention behind this question?</font>

511
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:17,773
<font color="yellow">What I mean is,</font>

512
00:34:18,443 --> 00:34:21,413
<font color="yellow">we should go listen to them.</font>

513
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:23,513
<font color="yellow">In my opinion,</font>

514
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:27,873
<font color="yellow">their conversation will really open up your ears.</font>

515
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:41,713
<font color="yellow">Chairman knows...</font>

516
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,873
<font color="yellow">that you're the son of the late director of Sudo Hospital.</font>

517
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:47,483
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

518
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:57,813
<font color="yellow">He's asking if you'd stop your attack against Dodo Group...</font>

519
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:02,573
<font color="yellow">if he were to hand over the evidence of Il Jae committing murder.</font>

520
00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:06,843
<font color="yellow">You're mistaken.</font>

521
00:35:08,143 --> 00:35:10,943
<font color="yellow">It won't end with just revealing Il Jae's crimes.</font>

522
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:16,273
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo instigated the murder in order to be acknowledged by you.</font>

523
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:20,813
<font color="yellow">Then you covered up his crime in order to save the company.</font>

524
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:24,113
<font color="yellow">You all aren't much different from Il Jae to me.</font>

525
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:30,373
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

526
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:34,313
<font color="yellow">You're an accomplice of Il Jae that killed my parents!</font>

527
00:35:36,573 --> 00:35:38,243
<font color="yellow">The chairman...</font>

528
00:35:38,243 --> 00:35:41,443
<font color="yellow">trusts you enough to give Shin Young to you.</font>

529
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:44,443
<font color="yellow">You should be thankful that she's your daughter.</font>

530
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,873
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for her,</font>

531
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,913
<font color="yellow">I would have ripped Dodo Group to shreds.</font>

532
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:01,543
<font color="yellow">Persuade Gun Woo...</font>

533
00:36:02,713 --> 00:36:04,913
<font color="yellow">to change the holding company to Dodo Hotel.</font>

534
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:07,483
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to reduce the damages.</font>

535
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:09,413
<font color="yellow">This is the last chance...</font>

536
00:36:10,843 --> 00:36:12,273
<font color="yellow">I'm giving to you.</font>

537
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:18,913
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

538
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:21,543
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

539
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:25,483
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

540
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,673
<font color="yellow">Chairman. Chairman...</font>

541
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:34,413
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

542
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:38,713
<font color="yellow">It's my fault.</font>

543
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,343
<font color="yellow">Chairman...</font>

544
00:36:47,943 --> 00:36:48,943
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

545
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:51,983
<font color="yellow">but it's too late.</font>

546
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:26,513
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

547
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:31,643
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

548
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,143
<font color="yellow">Shin Young.</font>

549
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:42,773
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

550
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:09,273
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

551
00:38:09,273 --> 00:38:11,043
<font color="yellow">Ask him yourself if you want to know.</font>

552
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:13,143
<font color="yellow">Shall I tell you my plan?</font>

553
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:15,373
<font color="yellow">Even if the company's torn apart,</font>

554
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:17,273
<font color="yellow">I won't give it to you.</font>

555
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:18,613
<font color="yellow">You got it all wrong.</font>

556
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:20,643
<font color="yellow">You won't give it to me.</font>

557
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:22,673
<font color="yellow">I'll take it from you.</font>

558
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:25,273
<font color="yellow">You took Soo Yeon from me,</font>

559
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:27,773
<font color="yellow">but I'll take everything from you.</font>

560
00:38:28,513 --> 00:38:29,773
<font color="yellow">Including Soo Yeon.</font>

561
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,543
<font color="yellow">I told you not to talk about her!</font>

562
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:45,813
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

563
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:48,543
<font color="yellow">You can't have Soo Yeon or the company.</font>

564
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:51,343
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll give up if you file for legal management?</font>

565
00:38:51,343 --> 00:38:53,013
<font color="yellow">- Sir. - Oh dear.</font>

566
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:55,143
<font color="yellow">- Sir. - What are you doing?</font>

567
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:58,143
<font color="yellow">You can't fight here. Everyone's watching.</font>

568
00:38:58,143 --> 00:39:02,243
<font color="yellow">Talk it out. Mouths aren't just for eating with.</font>

569
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:05,513
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Chairman Do's here.</font>

570
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:48,913
<font color="yellow">- Mr Moon. - Yes?</font>

571
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:51,043
<font color="yellow">Prepare to make a takeover bid on Dodo Group.</font>

572
00:39:52,983 --> 00:39:53,983
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo's...</font>

573
00:39:54,813 --> 00:39:56,543
<font color="yellow">trying to stall and...</font>

574
00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:58,013
<font color="yellow">I can't wait.</font>

575
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:02,843
<font color="yellow">How much money can we pool together?</font>

576
00:40:02,873 --> 00:40:05,613
<font color="yellow">So Gil Du agreed to finance us.</font>

577
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:07,943
<font color="yellow">How much can we borrow from Z Capital?</font>

578
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:11,143
<font color="yellow">Name the amount. I'll get it for you.</font>

579
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:12,743
<font color="yellow">Get the money.</font>

580
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:14,513
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group...</font>

581
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:17,143
<font color="yellow">is over.</font>

582
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:19,373
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Boss. - Yes, Sir.</font>

583
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:29,873
<font color="yellow">You heard...</font>

584
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:33,313
<font color="yellow">what Gi Tan thinks of us.</font>

585
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:37,573
<font color="yellow">Shall I explain everything for you?</font>

586
00:40:39,843 --> 00:40:42,943
<font color="yellow">I gave the order that Gi Tan's parents be killed...</font>

587
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:47,443
<font color="yellow">and Dad knew about it but covered it up. Why?</font>

588
00:40:49,273 --> 00:40:51,483
<font color="yellow">He wanted Dodo Group to prosper.</font>

589
00:40:53,643 --> 00:40:56,213
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan knew all that...</font>

590
00:40:56,813 --> 00:40:58,943
<font color="yellow">and approached you on purpose.</font>

591
00:40:58,943 --> 00:41:02,813
<font color="yellow">Now... Do you finally get it?</font>

592
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:06,943
<font color="yellow">Shin Young.</font>

593
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:09,773
<font color="yellow">It's not too late.</font>

594
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:15,243
<font color="yellow">If you and I think for ourselves and join forces,</font>

595
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:16,813
<font color="yellow">we can crush Gi Tan...</font>

596
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:25,913
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind? How dare you slap your big brother.</font>

597
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:27,443
<font color="yellow">Get lost, you moron.</font>

598
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:32,873
<font color="yellow">What? Moron?</font>

599
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:41,313
<font color="yellow">I'm not the moron here. You are.</font>

600
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:43,143
<font color="yellow">You're worse than a moron.</font>

601
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,143
<font color="yellow">You heard what he said.</font>

602
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:49,143
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan told our dad he can't forgive us.</font>

603
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,773
<font color="yellow">Once he takes out Gun Woo,</font>

604
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,873
<font color="yellow">you'll be next.</font>

605
00:41:57,243 --> 00:41:58,243
<font color="yellow">Do you get that?</font>

606
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:03,143
<font color="yellow">Shin Young, my dear sister.</font>

607
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:06,843
<font color="yellow">There's something called fate.</font>

608
00:42:07,143 --> 00:42:10,143
<font color="yellow">We're siblings. We're related.</font>

609
00:42:10,143 --> 00:42:14,943
<font color="yellow">I can't help but go against Gi Tan.</font>

610
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:19,313
<font color="yellow">That is our fate and destiny.</font>

611
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:36,573
<font color="yellow">That stupid brat.</font>

612
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:40,413
<font color="yellow">How many times did she hit me?</font>

613
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:06,613
<font color="yellow">You've had enough.</font>

614
00:43:11,143 --> 00:43:12,413
<font color="yellow">You're drunk.</font>

615
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:18,213
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

616
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:47,573
<font color="yellow">Go. Leave me alone.</font>

617
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:50,673
<font color="yellow">- Shin Young. - Don't touch me.</font>

618
00:43:50,843 --> 00:43:53,143
<font color="yellow">You're drunk. I'll carry you.</font>

619
00:43:56,873 --> 00:43:58,773
<font color="yellow">I'm your enemy's daughter.</font>

620
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:00,513
<font color="yellow">Forget about me.</font>

621
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:02,413
<font color="yellow">Whether I'm in danger or not.</font>

622
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,213
<font color="yellow">Shin Young.</font>

623
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,413
<font color="yellow">My dad was your enemy.</font>

624
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,613
<font color="yellow">You knew it all along.</font>

625
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,943
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

626
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:17,473
<font color="yellow">I fell for you and followed you around.</font>

627
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:19,973
<font color="yellow">Did you enjoy that?</font>

628
00:44:21,443 --> 00:44:23,843
<font color="yellow">- I didn't. - Don't make excuses!</font>

629
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:29,073
<font color="yellow">My dad and my brother did something terrible.</font>

630
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:32,973
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to suffer along with them?</font>

631
00:44:34,113 --> 00:44:37,373
<font color="yellow">Why does my life have to be torn apart?</font>

632
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,013
<font color="yellow">You did nothing wrong.</font>

633
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:48,313
<font color="yellow">You won't know,</font>

634
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,743
<font color="yellow">but you're the first man...</font>

635
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:54,773
<font color="yellow">I ever really loved.</font>

636
00:44:58,373 --> 00:44:59,373
<font color="yellow">Because of you,</font>

637
00:45:01,143 --> 00:45:02,213
<font color="yellow">my heart...</font>

638
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:05,613
<font color="yellow">beat so hard and fast.</font>

639
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:10,673
<font color="yellow">Why did you do this to me?</font>

640
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:12,543
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

641
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,443
<font color="yellow">You jerk. You scumbag. You dirtbag.</font>

642
00:45:26,743 --> 00:45:28,043
<font color="yellow">Do you know what...</font>

643
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:31,373
<font color="yellow">the hardest part of my plan was?</font>

644
00:45:34,243 --> 00:45:35,343
<font color="yellow">It was you.</font>

645
00:45:36,513 --> 00:45:38,243
<font color="yellow">You made it so much harder.</font>

646
00:45:39,143 --> 00:45:40,773
<font color="yellow">You're a great woman.</font>

647
00:45:43,813 --> 00:45:45,373
<font color="yellow">You're too good for me.</font>

648
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:51,773
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ga Din.</font>

649
00:45:53,443 --> 00:45:56,443
<font color="yellow">This isn't why I got drunk.</font>

650
00:45:57,913 --> 00:46:00,243
<font color="yellow">I wanted to apologise to you.</font>

651
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:03,713
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

652
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:21,773
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

653
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:27,713
<font color="yellow">You can leave me any time you want.</font>

654
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,573
<font color="yellow">Or you can stay.</font>

655
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:36,543
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

656
00:46:37,743 --> 00:46:39,713
<font color="yellow">the woman I trust the most.</font>

657
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:42,973
<font color="yellow">You're my business partner.</font>

658
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:49,443
<font color="yellow">I'll...</font>

659
00:46:50,913 --> 00:46:54,343
<font color="yellow">leave as soon as I find a great guy.</font>

660
00:46:56,743 --> 00:47:01,513
<font color="yellow">I'll marry a much better-looking man than you.</font>

661
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:06,113
<font color="yellow">I'll make you jealous.</font>

662
00:47:07,143 --> 00:47:08,343
<font color="yellow">That's how happy...</font>

663
00:47:09,143 --> 00:47:10,943
<font color="yellow">I'll be with him.</font>

664
00:47:25,013 --> 00:47:26,043
<font color="yellow">Yes, Shin Young.</font>

665
00:47:46,743 --> 00:47:48,113
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

666
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:58,143
<font color="yellow">He says...</font>

667
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:02,473
<font color="yellow">do what Gi Tan asks and change the holding company to Dodo Hotel.</font>

668
00:48:04,473 --> 00:48:07,473
<font color="yellow">Is that all he thought of after their chat?</font>

669
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:11,913
<font color="yellow">Greed can become one's downfall.</font>

670
00:48:13,213 --> 00:48:15,513
<font color="yellow">That's what made me like this.</font>

671
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:19,113
<font color="yellow">Father, I don't want to give in to Gi Tan.</font>

672
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,013
<font color="yellow">You don't want to give in to Mr Hwang,</font>

673
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:25,343
<font color="yellow">but look at you now while he became president.</font>

674
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:32,413
<font color="yellow">Even if it means I go down with Gi Tan,</font>

675
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:34,913
<font color="yellow">I will not be defeated like you were.</font>

676
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:36,513
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

677
00:48:43,673 --> 00:48:47,143
<font color="yellow">I think you should revoke his ownership.</font>

678
00:48:47,773 --> 00:48:50,873
<font color="yellow">You just have to give the word and I'll...</font>

679
00:48:51,673 --> 00:48:53,273
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

680
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:54,873
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

681
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:56,573
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo...</font>

682
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:00,843
<font color="yellow">Feel pity.</font>

683
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,543
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting for the informant to call?</font>

684
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:13,873
<font color="yellow">He's taking his time.</font>

685
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:17,373
<font color="yellow">Do you think something happened since then?</font>

686
00:49:20,773 --> 00:49:23,613
<font color="yellow">The director of the lab, Jung Man Ok felt...</font>

687
00:49:23,613 --> 00:49:25,643
<font color="yellow">the need to receive that money.</font>

688
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:28,673
<font color="yellow">Later, Man Ok became the director...</font>

689
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:30,643
<font color="yellow">and tried to get that money again.</font>

690
00:49:30,643 --> 00:49:33,473
<font color="yellow">However, she failed because the late directors' son,</font>

691
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:34,543
<font color="yellow">Lee Guk Cheol, declined.</font>

692
00:49:36,743 --> 00:49:37,913
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the informant...</font>

693
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,673
<font color="yellow">worked at Dodo Pharmaceutical at the time.</font>

694
00:49:40,773 --> 00:49:43,273
<font color="yellow">Couldn't it be someone from Sudo Hospital?</font>

695
00:49:43,973 --> 00:49:45,343
<font color="yellow">I was there at the time.</font>

696
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:49,143
<font color="yellow">Only the people on Jung Man Ok's team...</font>

697
00:49:49,143 --> 00:49:51,143
<font color="yellow">knew about the investment.</font>

698
00:49:51,343 --> 00:49:55,243
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo was in charge of brokering the deal.</font>

699
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:58,273
<font color="yellow">Who worked with him at the time?</font>

700
00:49:58,273 --> 00:50:01,843
<font color="yellow">Go Hae Sool, Chief Secretary of the Strategic Planning Department...</font>

701
00:50:01,843 --> 00:50:04,073
<font color="yellow">and Dodo Group's Han Sang Goo.</font>

702
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:06,513
<font color="yellow">See what they've been up to.</font>

703
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:09,743
<font color="yellow">I want to know about their work and private life.</font>

704
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:12,913
<font color="yellow">Do you think 1 of those 2 men is the informant?</font>

705
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,343
<font color="yellow">He asked me for some time.</font>

706
00:50:16,273 --> 00:50:18,643
<font color="yellow">There's a reason he can't give me...</font>

707
00:50:19,613 --> 00:50:20,943
<font color="yellow">the files right away.</font>

708
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:23,413
<font color="yellow">I'll find out.</font>

709
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:31,773
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

710
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:45,813
<font color="yellow">Are you going blind again?</font>

711
00:50:52,473 --> 00:50:53,543
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

712
00:50:54,313 --> 00:50:55,413
<font color="yellow">I'm okay now.</font>

713
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:59,373
<font color="yellow">This won't do. You need a checkup.</font>

714
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:23,643
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

715
00:51:32,573 --> 00:51:33,773
<font color="yellow">What did the doctor say?</font>

716
00:51:36,113 --> 00:51:37,943
<font color="yellow">It's temporary so I needn't worry.</font>

717
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:41,613
<font color="yellow">You two can go ahead. I'll take a walk.</font>

718
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,373
<font color="yellow">Did you ask the doctor?</font>

719
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:54,973
<font color="yellow">He said the same. That it's temporary.</font>

720
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,143
<font color="yellow">I will go blind?</font>

721
00:52:27,873 --> 00:52:28,913
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

722
00:52:29,273 --> 00:52:31,943
<font color="yellow">Is it because of the bullet in my head?</font>

723
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:33,673
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

724
00:52:33,673 --> 00:52:36,273
<font color="yellow">Something went wrong with your transplanted cornea.</font>

725
00:52:37,943 --> 00:52:39,613
<font color="yellow">Will another transplant...</font>

726
00:52:39,613 --> 00:52:42,073
<font color="yellow">Your optic nerves are already damaged.</font>

727
00:52:42,073 --> 00:52:44,143
<font color="yellow">Your vision will not improve.</font>

728
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:49,113

<font color="yellow">my vision again?</font>

731
00:52:57,643 --> 00:52:59,113
<font color="yellow">Maybe three months.</font>

732
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:01,413
<font color="yellow">You have six months at most.</font>

733
00:53:05,043 --> 00:53:06,543
<font color="yellow">I'll be on my way.</font>

736
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:15,473
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

737
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:18,043
<font color="yellow">before I go blind,</font>

738
00:53:20,343 --> 00:53:22,143

00:56:37,813 --> 00:56:39,073
<font color="yellow">There's no need to.</font>

776
00:56:40,613 --> 00:56:43,913
<font color="yellow">I talked to Mr Han. The Pandora's Box...</font>

777
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:46,273
<font color="yellow">is inside Gun Woo's safe.</font>

778
00:56:46,273 --> 00:56:49,413
<font color="yellow">I'll get my hands on it very soon. Just wait.</font>

779
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,143
<font color="yellow">We checked the safe already.</font>

780
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:54,473
<font color="yellow">It was empty. What are you talking about?</font>

781
00:56:55,013 --> 00:56:57,873
<font color="yellow">What? Wait... Mr Han...</font>

782
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,013
<font color="yellow">Did he lie to me again?</font>

783
00:57:06,273 --> 00:57:08,513
<font color="yellow">Choong Dong, I need you to...</font>

784
00:57:08,513 --> 00:57:09,773
<font color="yellow">call the guys.</font>

785
00:57:10,443 --> 00:57:11,613
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

786
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,973
<font color="yellow">Can we talk for a moment?</font>

787
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:26,273
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say to you.</font>

788
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:28,213
<font color="yellow">I have something to say.</font>

789
00:57:31,273 --> 00:57:32,673
<font color="yellow">I thought about it...</font>

790
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:35,313
<font color="yellow">and I don't know what I did wrong.</font>

791
00:57:36,513 --> 00:57:38,573
<font color="yellow">I did all I could to save the company.</font>

792
00:57:38,573 --> 00:57:40,113
<font color="yellow">And to win your heart.</font>

793
00:57:41,313 --> 00:57:42,573
<font color="yellow">What's wrong about that?</font>

794
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:44,513
<font color="yellow">You deceived me.</font>

795
00:57:44,513 --> 00:57:45,943
<font color="yellow">I did not.</font>

796
00:57:45,943 --> 00:57:47,673
<font color="yellow">If you had given me time,</font>

797
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,313
<font color="yellow">I'd have given you the proof...</font>

798
00:57:49,673 --> 00:57:51,443
<font color="yellow">to send Il Jae to prison.</font>

799
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:56,043
<font color="yellow">You can say all you want, but I can't trust you any more.</font>

800
00:57:57,613 --> 00:57:59,273
<font color="yellow">I just can't.</font>

801
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,543
<font color="yellow">I will give you...</font>

802
00:58:05,313 --> 00:58:06,673
<font color="yellow">what you want, Soo Yeon.</font>

803
00:58:07,773 --> 00:58:09,213
<font color="yellow">The Pandora's Box.</font>

804
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:13,343
<font color="yellow">Are you the one who had that?</font>

805
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:16,643
<font color="yellow">I won't give you up, Soo Yeon.</font>

806
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:26,743
<font color="yellow">Did you find something?</font>

807
00:58:27,113 --> 00:58:31,073
<font color="yellow">Go Hae Sool moved to the US, but I'm suspicious of Han Sang Goo.</font>

808
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:32,313
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

809
00:58:32,413 --> 00:58:35,813
<font color="yellow">He just put out his apartment for an urgent sale.</font>

810
00:58:36,573 --> 00:58:39,973
<font color="yellow">His wife and daughter suddenly moved to Canada a few days ago.</font>

811
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:46,213
<font color="yellow">I think you're right, Boss.</font>

812
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:49,473
<font color="yellow">We'll buy his apartment.</font>

813
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:50,643
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

814
00:58:52,113 --> 00:58:53,613
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

815
00:58:55,413 --> 00:58:58,813
<font color="yellow">I want to be there, but I need to sell the place first.</font>

816
00:59:01,473 --> 00:59:04,643
<font color="yellow">I'll go over to Canada as soon as everything is settled.</font>

817
01:00:16,543 --> 01:00:19,073
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll get five million dollars and leave.</font>

818
01:00:19,843 --> 01:00:23,773
<font color="yellow">I've had enough of this life.</font>

819
01:00:29,313 --> 01:00:30,313
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

820
01:00:30,573 --> 01:00:31,943
<font color="yellow">I'm the real estate agent.</font>

821
01:00:32,473 --> 01:00:34,673
<font color="yellow">Right, does someone want to buy my apartment?</font>

822
01:00:40,143 --> 01:00:43,273
<font color="yellow">They want to sign the papers today.</font>

823
01:00:44,243 --> 01:00:45,443
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

824
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,873
<font color="yellow">It'll take him about an hour.</font>

825
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:48,873
<font color="yellow">We're fine.</font>

826
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:50,713
<font color="yellow">They will wait.</font>

827
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,213
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

828
01:00:53,113 --> 01:00:54,413
<font color="yellow">- Please, sit. - Sure.</font>

829
01:00:58,843 --> 01:00:59,913
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised?</font>

830
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:04,613
<font color="yellow">Anyone would get surprised if you suddenly stand from behind.</font>

831
01:01:04,943 --> 01:01:07,043
<font color="yellow">Are you selling your apartment?</font>

832
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,143
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

833
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:10,143
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

834
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:12,143
<font color="yellow">You just moved there.</font>

835
01:01:12,643 --> 01:01:16,213
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim, I have an urgent business. I have to go right now.</font>

836
01:01:16,413 --> 01:01:18,143
<font color="yellow">Please tell the chairman for me.</font>

837
01:01:35,843 --> 01:01:39,573
<font color="yellow">Auxiliary power is on. Safe unlocked.</font>

838
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:54,943
<font color="yellow">Do you still have the Pandora's Box?</font>

839
01:01:55,443 --> 01:01:56,573
<font color="yellow">Did you do this?</font>

840
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,913
<font color="yellow">- What? - Did you steal it?</font>

841
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:05,573
<font color="yellow">Han Sang Goo did steal it.</font>

842
01:02:05,943 --> 01:02:08,043
<font color="yellow">Are you sure he's at the office?</font>

843
01:02:08,043 --> 01:02:09,843
<font color="yellow">I checked in on him just now.</font>

844
01:02:24,043 --> 01:02:25,043
<font color="yellow">(Chairman)</font>

845
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:29,873
<font color="yellow">Mr Han, wait.</font>

846
01:02:33,243 --> 01:02:34,243
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

847
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:36,613
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Yes.</font>

848
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:01,313
<font color="yellow">That's Han Sang Goo.</font>

849
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,143
<font color="yellow">Follow him.</font>

850
01:03:09,543 --> 01:03:11,443
<font color="yellow">Chairman, that's Il Jae.</font>

851
01:03:13,313 --> 01:03:14,843
<font color="yellow">The car behind him is with him, too.</font>

852
01:03:15,643 --> 01:03:18,573
<font color="yellow">I don't care who it is. I won't let anyone take it away.</font>

853
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:19,943
<font color="yellow">Get closer.</font>

854
01:03:19,973 --> 01:03:20,973
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chairman.</font>

855
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:32,143
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

856
01:03:38,573 --> 01:03:39,573
<font color="yellow">It's Gun Woo.</font>

857
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:01,773
<font color="yellow">Chairman.</font>

858
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,343
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

859
01:04:08,743 --> 01:04:10,713
<font color="yellow">I'm Han Sang Goo.</font>

860
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:14,673
<font color="yellow">I am the informant behind the Pandora's Box.</font>

861
01:04:15,213 --> 01:04:17,543
<font color="yellow">Will you send me the money as promised?</font>

862
01:04:19,513 --> 01:04:20,513
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

863
01:04:20,513 --> 01:04:24,413
<font color="yellow">Il Jae and Gun Woo are chasing after me right now.</font>

864
01:04:25,973 --> 01:04:29,213
<font color="yellow">If you don't save me right now, they will take the Pandora's Box.</font>

865
01:04:29,943 --> 01:04:31,643
<font color="yellow">Please save me, Chairman Kang!</font>

866
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:33,943
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>
