-  It's taking longer than I thought.</font>

68
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,970
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. I haven't got time.</font>

69
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,100
<font color="yellow">You've prepared more than enough for this.</font>

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,200
<font color="yellow">I thought I did, but I don't think it was enough.</font>

71

<font color="yellow">He needs to be proven guilty in this trial.</font>

72
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,660
<font color="yellow">Look at my eyes for a second.</font>

73
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,860
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo, the trial will be...</font>

74
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,330
<font color="yellow">Calm down and look at me, Soo Yeon.</font>

75
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,880
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

76
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,400
<font color="yellow">Do you remember...</font>

77
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,500
<font color="yellow">how I asked you to put on my tie when you were my assistant?</font>

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,460
<font color="yellow">With the presentation coming along,</font>

79
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,060
<font color="yellow">I was really nervous back then.</font>

80
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,430
<font color="yellow">But when you put that tie on me, I felt more relaxed...</font>

81
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,630
<font color="yellow">and gained courage.</font>

82
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,360
<font color="yellow">You'll do great today.</font>

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,860
<font color="yellow">I guarantee it.</font>

84
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,630
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Gun Woo.</font>

85
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,160
<font color="yellow">Should I give her the Xanax myself?</font>

86
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
<font color="yellow">I think that would be better.</font>

87
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,330
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Nam, you can go ahead first.</font>

88
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,360
<font color="yellow">- You should go in.
-  Okay.</font>

89
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,800
<font color="yellow">I believe...</font>

90
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,760
<font color="yellow">I gave you enough chances so far.</font>

91
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,060
<font color="yellow">I turned a blind eye to things...</font>

92
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,330
<font color="yellow">while hoping for you to come back to your place.</font>

93
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,530
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo. You'll realise how foolish...</font>

94
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,870
<font color="yellow">your decision was today.</font>

95
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,100
<font color="yellow">I'm fine with that.</font>

96
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,740
<font color="yellow">I don't care if I make mistakes or even break and tear.</font>

97
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,900
<font color="yellow">At least that way,</font>

98
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
<font color="yellow">I won't become a monster like you.</font>

99
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
<font color="yellow">A monster?</font>

100
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,530
<font color="yellow">The real monster is the world, not the person.</font>

101
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,960
<font color="yellow">Once Dodo Group goes under Gwi Ja and Gwang Woo's power,</font>

102
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,130
<font color="yellow">you'll see what a monster really looks like.</font>

103
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,330
<font color="yellow">Did you see that?</font>

104
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,630
<font color="yellow">Look at that. If his eyes could kill,</font>

105
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,560
<font color="yellow">he would have killed Gun Woo already.</font>

106
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,730
<font color="yellow">You're right. By the way,</font>

107
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,900
<font color="yellow">which side should we be cheering for?</font>

108
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,160
<font color="yellow">Since it came to this,</font>

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,900
<font color="yellow">it'd be better for Il Jae to be convicted.</font>

110
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,260
<font color="yellow">That's true. If Il Jae is found guilty,</font>

111
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,760
<font color="yellow">the two of them will never work together again.</font>

112
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,760
<font color="yellow">That, too.</font>

113
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,530
<font color="yellow">But Soo Yeon is their prosecutor.</font>

114
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,300
<font color="yellow">We should support her fully.</font>

115
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,600
<font color="yellow">In any case, all we have to do...</font>

116
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,130
<font color="yellow">is sit back and watch.</font>

117
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,300
<font color="yellow">Let's enjoy this.</font>

118
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,930
<font color="yellow">Case number 4958.</font>

119
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,000
<font color="yellow">We'll start the hearing on the violation of the election law...</font>

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,360

121

122
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,330
<font color="yellow">During the Seoul mayoral campaign,</font>

123
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,950
<font color="yellow">you've handed over money to an independent candidate,</font>

124
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,050
<font color="yellow">Cho Cham, to come to an illegal agreement. Do you admit to this?</font>

125
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,880
<font color="yellow">I never had an illegal agreement.</font>

126
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,020
<font color="yellow">Cho has already confessed this to the prosecution.</font>

127
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,070
<font color="yellow">It's a conspiracy.</font>

128
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,360
<font color="yellow">2.5 million dollars of bearer bond was found in Cho's secret safe.</font>

129
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,830
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it given to him in exchange for giving up his candidacy?</font>

130
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
<font color="yellow">He was moved by my campaign...</font>

131
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,180
<font color="yellow">and decided to support me.</font>

132
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,730
<font color="yellow">All I did was accept his offer.</font>

133
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,630
<font color="yellow">You can meet with my aide, who was with me...</font>

134
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,130
<font color="yellow">when I met with Cho,</font>

135
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,600
<font color="yellow">to see if I'm lying or not.</font>

136
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,720
<font color="yellow">Defendant, we're at court.</font>

137
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,070

-  Prosecutor Oh.</font>

138
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,300
<font color="yellow">Do you still believe that I'm involved in your brother's death?</font>

139
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,130
<font color="yellow">Defendant.</font>

140
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,760
<font color="yellow">It's the prosecutor that asks the questions.</font>

141
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,960
<font color="yellow">Are you unfairly targeting me...</font>

142
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,300
<font color="yellow">based on personal feelings?</font>

143
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,960
<font color="yellow">I said, I'm the one that will ask questions.</font>

144
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,430
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Oh, please calm down.</font>

145
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,200
<font color="yellow">Defendant,</font>

146
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,700
<font color="yellow">please do not bring up issues irrelevant to this case.</font>

147
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,960
<font color="yellow">It's related to this case.</font>

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,500
<font color="yellow">Candidate Cho...</font>

149
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,460
<font color="yellow">might have been asked to do this by someone else's request.</font>

150
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,460
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

151
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,340
<font color="yellow">the prosecutor...</font>

152
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,660
<font color="yellow">never considered the possibility and ruled it out from the start.</font>

153
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
<font color="yellow">Your Honour.</font>

154
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,260
<font color="yellow">I would like to call Cho Cham as a witness.</font>

155
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,200
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is putting up a good fight.</font>

156

159
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,400
<font color="yellow">I think the game is over now.</font>

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,000
<font color="yellow">You have received 2.5 million dollars' worth...</font>

<font color="yellow">never happened.</font>

168

<font color="yellow">I was forced...</font>

170
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
<font color="yellow">to confess a lie.</font>

171
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,330

00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,530

187
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,860
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

188
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,830
<font color="yellow">How I'll act...</font>

189
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,000
<font color="yellow">depends on you.</font>

190
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,230
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you already know what you have to do at court...</font>

191
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,960
<font color="yellow">without my explaining it.</font>

192
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,900
<font color="yellow">Look here, Byun Il Jae!</font>

193
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,300
<font color="yellow">The man who's currently with your family...</font>

194

<font color="yellow">tends to get very violent at times.</font>

195
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,860
<font color="yellow">I'll see you in court, Mr Cho.</font>

196
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,330
<font color="yellow">Your Honour. There was an incident this morning...</font>

197
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,960
<font color="yellow">at the detention centre where our witness almost lost his life.</font>

198
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,360
<font color="yellow">We have suspicions that the defendant instigated the attack.</font>

199
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,930
<font color="yellow">I object.</font>

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,580
<font color="yellow">The prosecution is defaming the defendant without any evidence.</font>

201
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,000
<font color="yellow">We will find out in this very court if I'm defaming him or not.</font>

202
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,580
<font color="yellow">Witness.</font>

203
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,800
<font color="yellow">Have you ever felt that your life was in danger?</font>

204
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,830
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

205
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,080
<font color="yellow">Someone attempted to murder him with poison in a syringe.</font>

206
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,600
<font color="yellow">The syringe you're talking about is...</font>

207
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,900
<font color="yellow">the insulin I take for my diabetes.</font>

208
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,400
<font color="yellow">Something seems off.</font>

209
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,300
<font color="yellow">I have a bad feeling about this.</font>

210
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,900
<font color="yellow">The result from the chemical test to find the components...</font>

211
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,330
<font color="yellow">of that syringe has arrived.</font>

212
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,960
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor. What was in the syringe that almost killed the witness?</font>

213
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,260
<font color="yellow">Announce the verdict.</font>

214
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,030
<font color="yellow">It was...</font>

215
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,430
<font color="yellow">his insulin.</font>

216
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,330
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Oh,</font>

217
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
<font color="yellow">why did you have to frame me and conduct...</font>

218
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,030
<font color="yellow">a targeted investigation?</font>

219
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,030
<font color="yellow">Your call has been forwarded...</font>

220
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,840
<font color="yellow">Is she still not picking up?</font>

221
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,490
<font color="yellow">Something must've happened.</font>

222
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,220
<font color="yellow">Are you sure she didn't change her mind?</font>

223
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,640
<font color="yellow">That won't happen.</font>

224
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,560
<font color="yellow">If something did happen, Il Jae is definitely...</font>

225
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,500
<font color="yellow">Independent prosecutor, you've made a fool out of yourself.</font>

226
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,830
<font color="yellow">The second trial isn't over yet.</font>

227
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,400
<font color="yellow">You will never prove me guilty...</font>

228
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,270
<font color="yellow">because I have never sinned.</font>

229
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,680
<font color="yellow">Competence lies in winning,</font>

230
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,870
<font color="yellow">but it also lies in knowing when to give up.</font>

231
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,330
<font color="yellow">Stop wasting your time...</font>

232
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,300
<font color="yellow">and order a suspension of prosecution, Prosecutor Oh.</font>

233
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,500
<font color="yellow">May I have Chae Ryung's mobile number?</font>

234
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,700
<font color="yellow">I'll chase her from the place of her last phone call.</font>

235
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,500
<font color="yellow">We'll get some people to find her, too.</font>

236
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,270
<font color="yellow">I thought things were already over.</font>

237
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,900
<font color="yellow">I didn't know it would take a turn.</font>

238
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,600
<font color="yellow">- Mr Moon.
-  Yes, Sir?</font>

239
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,660
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you a question.</font>

240
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,930
<font color="yellow">Is Chae Ryung...</font>

241
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,930
<font color="yellow">our missing witness?</font>

242
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,930
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought.</font>

243
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,630
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

244
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung...</font>

245
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,800
<font color="yellow">insisted on helping you.</font>

246
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,030
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you're working for?</font>

247
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,630
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

248
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,130
<font color="yellow">Mobilise everyone...</font>

249
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,030
<font color="yellow">and find her.</font>

250
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,610
<font color="yellow">You have to find her alive.</font>

251
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

252
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gun Woo.</font>

253
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,000
<font color="yellow">How did you know I was here?</font>

254
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,230
<font color="yellow">You had a lot to drink.</font>

255
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,930
<font color="yellow">It's because I feel awful...</font>

256
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,000
<font color="yellow">and angry.</font>

257
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,520
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

258
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you sorry?</font>

259
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,900
<font color="yellow">Today's trial is...</font>

260
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,770
<font color="yellow">all my fault. It's not yours.</font>

261
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,580
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

262
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,630
<font color="yellow">It's because...</font>

263
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,360
<font color="yellow">I tied your scarf the wrong way.</font>

264
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,370
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  It should've been on the right,</font>

265
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,100
<font color="yellow">not the left.</font>

266
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,500
<font color="yellow">I'd rather see you smile.</font>

267
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,200

271
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,630
<font color="yellow">Have a drink.</font>

272
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,900
<font color="yellow">No, thanks. I drove here.</font>

273
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,660
<font color="yellow">I'll take you home,</font>

274
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
<font color="yellow">so have as much as you want.</font>

275
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,630
<font color="yellow">Have some. I'll take a taxi.</font>

276
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,800
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do asked me...</font>

277
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,830

280
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,330
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to Father and...</font>

281
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,500
<font color="yellow">I found a way.</font>

282
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,160
<font color="yellow">You barely had time to sleep.</font>

283
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,230
<font color="yellow">How did you find that?</font>

284
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,730
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to know what that way is?</font>

285
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

286
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,060
<font color="yellow">Is that possible?</font>

287
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, definitely.</font>

288
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,460

289
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,160
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  Don't worry, Father.</font>

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,760
<font color="yellow">and let you die in Gi Tan's hands.</font>

312
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,100
<font color="yellow">That's probably the worst way to die for you.</font>

313
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
<font color="yellow">I've never seen that bracelet before.</font>

314
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,960
<font color="yellow">This is too uncomfortable. At least set my arms free.</font>

315
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,300
<font color="yellow">This care centre is strict on its rules.</font>

316
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,660
<font color="yellow">Especially...</font>

317
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,660
<font color="yellow">for the patients who have mental problems, like you.</font>

318
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,040
<font color="yellow">Breathe in and push your legs.</font>

319
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,430
<font color="yellow">Put more strength on your ankles.</font>

320
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,760
<font color="yellow">Push them. That's it.</font>

321
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

322
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,230
<font color="yellow">That hurts!</font>

323
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,630
<font color="yellow">You're doing well, Chairman.</font>

324
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,330
<font color="yellow">Your legs are much more flexible now.</font>

325
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,520
<font color="yellow">Stop it! It really hurts!</font>

326
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,930
<font color="yellow">The general meeting is around the corner.</font>

327
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,500
<font color="yellow">You need to show the people that you are healthy.</font>

328
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,200
<font color="yellow">Chairman, are you okay?</font>

329
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,000
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop.</font>

330
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

331
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,470
<font color="yellow">That hurts!</font>

332
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,160
<font color="yellow">That hurts! Come on!</font>

333
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,500
<font color="yellow">Father, what's wrong?</font>

334
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gun Woo.</font>

335
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,050
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Don't worry.</font>

336
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,260
<font color="yellow">This isn't nothing!</font>

337
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,640
<font color="yellow">You almost ripped my legs apart.</font>

338
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,520
<font color="yellow">Did you find out who switched your medicine?</font>

339
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,100
<font color="yellow">- We did.
-  Come on!</font>

340
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,430
<font color="yellow">I told you not to tell him.</font>

341
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,530
<font color="yellow">Is it Ms Hwang? Or is it Gwang Woo?</font>

342
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,430
<font color="yellow">I need to know this before the general meeting.</font>

343
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,500
<font color="yellow">Who is it, Father?</font>

344
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
<font color="yellow">It was...</font>

345
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,630
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja.</font>

346
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,260
<font color="yellow">My own wife...</font>

347
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,600
<font color="yellow">tried to kill me.</font>

348
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,000
<font color="yellow">Show me the evidence.</font>

349
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,130
<font color="yellow">Do we have a laptop in the car?</font>

350
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,340
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

351
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,100
<font color="yellow">- Let's go out and eat.
-  Yes.</font>

352
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,360
<font color="yellow">What took you so long?</font>

353
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,130
<font color="yellow">I came as soon as you called.</font>

354
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,060
<font color="yellow">- Where's the medicine?
-  Here it is.</font>

355
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,830
<font color="yellow">- These are supplements, right?
-  Yes, Ma'am.</font>

356
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,860
<font color="yellow">Keep watch.</font>

357
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,430
<font color="yellow">Leave this to me.</font>

358
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,130
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

359
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,830
<font color="yellow">Don't get so upset, Gun Woo.</font>

360
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,030
<font color="yellow">This is attempted murder. She tried to kill you.</font>

361
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,000
<font color="yellow">It won't be revenge if you give back what you got.</font>

362
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,000
<font color="yellow">You have to give them...</font>

363
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,130
<font color="yellow">a lot more than what they gave you to make it a real revenge.</font>

364
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,900
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm trying to do.</font>

365
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,160
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo. There's nothing as unsightly as a family feud.</font>

366
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,700
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter who the victim or the perpetrator is.</font>

367
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,100
<font color="yellow">The world will find...</font>

368
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
<font color="yellow">all of us hideous.</font>

369
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,630
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to get your hands dirty.</font>

370
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,830
<font color="yellow">That way, if you lead Dodo Group in the future,</font>

371
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,160
<font color="yellow">no one will be able to pick on your weaknesses.</font>

372
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,400
<font color="yellow">I'm not scared of that.</font>

373
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,930
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

374
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,760
<font color="yellow">If they badmouth me, I'll crush them with my capability.</font>

375
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,100
<font color="yellow">Watch me during the EGM.</font>

376
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,430
<font color="yellow">I won't disappoint you.</font>

377
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
<font color="yellow">Make up?</font>

378
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,200
<font color="yellow">You want me to make up with your dad?</font>

379
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,110
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for him. He lost his company and his health.</font>

380
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,200
<font color="yellow">I reached my hand out.</font>

381
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,100
<font color="yellow">He's the one that declined.</font>

382
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,630
<font color="yellow">Mum. To be honest,</font>

383
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,840
<font color="yellow">I want to get along with Dad.</font>

384
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,030
<font color="yellow">If he was in my shoes, do you think he would ask me to make up?</font>

385
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,300
<font color="yellow">If it was him, he would watch me shrivel up and die.</font>

386
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,230
<font color="yellow">He should feel lucky that I'm treating him nicely.</font>

387
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,400
<font color="yellow">Father, did you go for a walk?</font>

388
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
<font color="yellow">He did.</font>

389
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,400
<font color="yellow">You don't seem to have an appetite these days,</font>

390
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,630
<font color="yellow">so I got you some sushi.</font>

391
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,360
<font color="yellow">- Mr Gong.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

392
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,660
<font color="yellow">But this place is really delicious.</font>

393
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,060
<font color="yellow">You don't know if it's a dog or a wolf until you get bitten.</font>

394
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,400
<font color="yellow">How is he going to run the company if he's soft like that?</font>

395
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,360
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

396
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,700
<font color="yellow">Try some. It would have been more tasty if you had it earlier.</font>

397
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,700
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, say it.</font>

398
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,130
<font color="yellow">Enough with beating around the bush.</font>

399
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,430
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong, can you get my dad a glass of water?</font>

400
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,730
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

401
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,030
<font color="yellow">I've been watching until now,</font>

402
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,200
<font color="yellow">and it hurts me so much to see you suffer.</font>

403
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,850
<font color="yellow">I wish you could just...</font>

404
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,730
<font color="yellow">live in comfort now.</font>

405
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,800
<font color="yellow">Do you even know...</font>

406
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,660
<font color="yellow">what makes me comfortable?</font>

407
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,430
<font color="yellow">This EGM...</font>

408
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,260
<font color="yellow">is just a formality.</font>

409
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,200
<font color="yellow">The shareholders already agreed to kick Gun Woo out...</font>

410
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,660
<font color="yellow">and put Mum as the chairwoman.</font>

411
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,070
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

412
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,200
<font color="yellow">please let me take over the company.</font>

413
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,900
<font color="yellow">I mean... I really intend on taking good care of you.</font>

414
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,000
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you get embarrassed by the shareholders...</font>

415
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,530
<font color="yellow">at the EGM.</font>

416
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,630
<font color="yellow">You'll take good care of me?</font>

417
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,730
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

418
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,760
<font color="yellow">I'm confident I can help you live a comfortable life.</font>

419
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,200
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

420
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,100
<font color="yellow">stop your mother from becoming the chairwoman...</font>

421
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,530
<font color="yellow">and you should resign.</font>

422
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,360
<font color="yellow">- Father.
-  If you can't do that,</font>

423
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,760
<font color="yellow">then stop with the act. Forget about trying to be nice!</font>

424
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,860
<font color="yellow">I've had enough of your sugar-coated nonsense.</font>

425
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,530
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

426
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,530
<font color="yellow">Throw out this sushi in the garbage.</font>

427
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,530
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  Throw it out right now!</font>

428
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,500
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

429
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,660
<font color="yellow">Do you really want me to go astray?</font>

430
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,160
<font color="yellow">You've already gone astray.</font>

431
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,400
<font color="yellow">I don't care what happens to you.</font>

432
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,360
<font color="yellow">You should just go back to your mother.</font>

433
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,060
<font color="yellow">I said, get out!</font>

434
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,160
<font color="yellow">He acts exactly the same...</font>

435
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,100
<font color="yellow">as his mother.</font>

436
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

437
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,300
<font color="yellow">You want me...</font>

438
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,030
<font color="yellow">to live in comfort?</font>

439
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,200
<font color="yellow">I'm really going to go astray now.</font>

440
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,060
<font color="yellow">You just watch, Father.</font>

441
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,200
<font color="yellow">At the location where Chae Ryung disappeared that day,</font>

442
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,810
<font color="yellow">were there any individuals from Il Jae's side...</font>

443
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,160
<font color="yellow">that were also there?</font>

444
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,930
<font color="yellow">From the investigation materials we got,</font>

445
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,560
<font color="yellow">there wasn't anyone.</font>

446
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,760
<font color="yellow">How many phones were used within a 100m radius?</font>

447
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,830
<font color="yellow">There were a total of 89 phones.</font>

448
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,300
<font color="yellow">- Can I get the list?
-  Here.</font>

449
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,710
<font color="yellow">Why don't we split it up and call them?</font>

450
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,840
<font color="yellow">I need to check after, so make sure you record everything.</font>

451
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,930
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

452
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,130
<font color="yellow">Shall we get started?</font>

453
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,590
<font color="yellow">You'll reimburse me for the calls I make, right?</font>

454
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,900
<font color="yellow">Thanks a lot for ruining the mood.</font>

455
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,660
<font color="yellow">I will, so don't worry.</font>

456
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,030
<font color="yellow">We have to try and talk to them for a long time.</font>

457
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,400
<font color="yellow">That'll give us substance.</font>

458
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,900
<font color="yellow">Who would come at this hour?</font>

459
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,730
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

460
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,360
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, it's CEO Do Gwang Woo.</font>

461
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,900
<font color="yellow">We're already busy as it is. Why is he here?</font>

462
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,160
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he's such an idiot.</font>

463
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,730
<font color="yellow">I'll be back. Keep working.</font>

464
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,500
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

465
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,580
<font color="yellow">Is this Yang Ok Ja's number?</font>

466
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,630
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

467
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,060
<font color="yellow">Ok Ja! It's me, Hong Man!</font>

468
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,000
<font color="yellow">I said, it's not me.</font>

469
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. You have the same voice.</font>

470
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,980
<font color="yellow">Did she change her number?</font>

471
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but when did you start using this number?</font>

472
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,030
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

473
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,700
<font color="yellow">Why would you come here at this hour?</font>

474
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,360
<font color="yellow">I was feeling down.</font>

475
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,530
<font color="yellow">Somehow,</font>

476
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,630
<font color="yellow">I ended up here.</font>

477
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,100
<font color="yellow">I'm not your joker.</font>

478
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,430
<font color="yellow">Why would you come here when you're down?</font>

479
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,230
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

480
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,630
<font color="yellow">I was so upset that I drank alone.</font>

481
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,230
<font color="yellow">- I'm busy. You should go.
-  Hey.</font>

482
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,300
<font color="yellow">I sent you so many gifts. Why haven't you said anything?</font>

483
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,820
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I went through to pick them out for you?</font>

484
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,030
<font color="yellow">They're wrapped up, so you can take them with you.</font>

485
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,700
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

486
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,030
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

487
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,060
<font color="yellow">how I feel these days?</font>

488
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,430
<font color="yellow">I'm reminded of you whenever I'm eating something delicious.</font>

489
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,700
<font color="yellow">I'm reminded of you whenever I see anything beautiful.</font>

490
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,700
<font color="yellow">I'm reminded of you whenever there is something fun happening.</font>

491
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,430
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

492
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,430
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon. Oh Soo Yeon!</font>

493
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,300
<font color="yellow">All I can think about is you.</font>

494
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,630
<font color="yellow">If Il Jae...</font>

495
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,000
<font color="yellow">wins this trial,</font>

496
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,830
<font color="yellow">he'll give you a really hard time.</font>

497
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,360
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo has been abandoned by Il Jae and is useless now.</font>

498
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,670
<font color="yellow">You should think realistically.</font>

499
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,060
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one who can protect you.</font>

500
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,230
<font color="yellow">You should go see a psychiatrist.</font>

501
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,260
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I only see you as a mad man.</font>

502
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,830
<font color="yellow">Hey, watch it.</font>

503
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,170
<font color="yellow">Get treatment.</font>

504
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,700
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll realise why I despise you so much.</font>

505
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,460
<font color="yellow">How could you?</font>

506
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,850
<font color="yellow">I barely controlled myself from going astray...</font>

507
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,830
<font color="yellow">and came here.</font>

508
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,030
<font color="yellow">I don't care what happens to you.</font>

509
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,060
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

510
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,700
<font color="yellow">Why are you...</font>

511
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,980
<font color="yellow">saying the same thing as my father did?</font>

512
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,510
<font color="yellow">I said, get lost.</font>

513
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,300
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'll report you for trespassing.</font>

514
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,700
<font color="yellow">I guess you still don't realise...</font>

515
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,200
<font color="yellow">how much of a scary person I am.</font>

516
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,880
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

517
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,300
<font color="yellow">Is it good enough for the Chinese shipowners?</font>

518
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

519
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
<font color="yellow">Do you mean that?</font>

520
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,850
<font color="yellow">You can do well if you put your mind to it.</font>

521
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,860
<font color="yellow">Ga Din, are you finally acknowledging my skill?</font>

522
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,260
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't partner up with someone I don't acknowledge.</font>

523
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,900
<font color="yellow">Give me any job...</font>

524
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,830
<font color="yellow">and I'll make your jaw drop.</font>

525
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,430
<font color="yellow">Why is she here?</font>

526
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,560
<font color="yellow">You're grossing me out.</font>

527
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,960
<font color="yellow">It's time for our meeting, Sir.</font>

528
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,840
<font color="yellow">Come upstairs.</font>

529
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,860
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

530
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,460
<font color="yellow">The meeting should be with me.</font>

531
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,910
<font color="yellow">Kang Ga Din. Kang Ga Din!</font>

532
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,030
<font color="yellow">It's an important meeting. You can see him later.</font>

533
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,800
<font color="yellow">I should just...</font>

534
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,280
<font color="yellow">Did you see him change as soon as Soo Yeon came in?</font>

535
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,480
<font color="yellow">I think you're the one who changed.</font>

536
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,860
<font color="yellow">- "It's time for our meeting."
-  What?</font>

537
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

538
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,830
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

539
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,260
<font color="yellow">I wanted to have dinner with him.</font>

540
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
<font color="yellow">Cho Cham wants a new lawyer.</font>

541
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,860
<font color="yellow">I don't think we can persuade him.</font>

542
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,850
<font color="yellow">Where is Chae Ryung?</font>

543
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,730
<font color="yellow">Two of the numbers on the list...</font>

544
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,100
<font color="yellow">were suspicious burner phones.</font>

545
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,850
<font color="yellow">One number is no longer listed,</font>

546
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,170
<font color="yellow">and the other has been turned off for days.</font>

547
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,330
<font color="yellow">We can't locate it unless it's turned on.</font>

548
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,680
<font color="yellow">This is bad. The second trial's nearing.</font>

549
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,230
<font color="yellow">As soon as I get a warrant,</font>

550
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,100
<font color="yellow">I'll search Il Jae's office.</font>

551
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,460
<font color="yellow">We have to find proof of his illegal funds...</font>

552
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,730
<font color="yellow">I have bad news.</font>

553
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,730
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Park just called.</font>

554
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,060
<font color="yellow">The search and seizure warrant was denied.</font>

555
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,060
<font color="yellow">Who turned it down?</font>

556
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
<font color="yellow">I'll meet him.</font>

557
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

558
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,930
<font color="yellow">However bad things turn out, we must stick to the books.</font>

559
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,670
<font color="yellow">If we slip up now,</font>

560
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,930
<font color="yellow">the trial's over.</font>

561
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,400
<font color="yellow">Find Chae Ryung.</font>

562
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,500
<font color="yellow">She's the only one...</font>

563
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
<font color="yellow">who can stop Il Jae.</font>

564
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,170
<font color="yellow">I was wondering how you hurt your wrist.</font>

565
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,800
<font color="yellow">You were trying to escape.</font>

566
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,730
<font color="yellow">Untying yourself...</font>

567
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,670
<font color="yellow">won't get you anywhere.</font>

568
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,930
<font color="yellow">Your lips are chapped.</font>

569
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,300
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

570
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,960
<font color="yellow">You must be very thirsty.</font>

571
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,830
<font color="yellow">I don't need your pity.</font>

572
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,630
<font color="yellow">The trial concludes tomorrow.</font>

573
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,360
<font color="yellow">Once I'm acquitted, you'll be set free.</font>

574
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,930
<font color="yellow">So don't exhaust yourself.</font>

575
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,530
<font color="yellow">Drink.</font>

576
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,500
<font color="yellow">If I didn't find out that you were a spy,</font>

577
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,860
<font color="yellow">I'd have sold my soul for you.</font>

578
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,030
<font color="yellow">Of all the women I've met,</font>

579
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,700
<font color="yellow">you're the most charming...</font>

580
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,400
<font color="yellow">Of all the men I've met...</font>

581
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,060
<font color="yellow">you are the worst.</font>

582
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,400
<font color="yellow">I love your fiery personality.</font>

583
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,700
<font color="yellow">It's such a pity to think...</font>

584
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,200
<font color="yellow">it'll die with you.</font>

585
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,500
<font color="yellow">Sir, Sir.</font>

586
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,070
<font color="yellow">You're wife's coming up.</font>

587
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,100
<font color="yellow">Quickly.</font>

588
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,670
<font color="yellow">What did you say to Gwang Woo?</font>

589
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,110
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

590
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,760
<font color="yellow">What did you say to him to make him drink so much?</font>

591
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,600
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong.</font>

592
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,530
<font color="yellow">Get her out of here. She's draining my energy.</font>

593
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,630
<font color="yellow">He's your son.</font>

594
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,530
<font color="yellow">He's the son we made together.</font>

595
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,500
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel sorry for him?</font>

596
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,000
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo...</font>

597
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,200
<font color="yellow">is your son.</font>

598
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,430
<font color="yellow">He isn't mine.</font>

599
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

600
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,800
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is my only son.</font>

601
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,030
<font color="yellow">The woman whom I loved...</font>

602
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,000
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, the chairman is in a weakened...</font>

603
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,460
<font color="yellow">I'm the chairwoman!</font>

604
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,500
<font color="yellow">Don't call me Mrs Hwang!</font>

605
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,260
<font color="yellow">All these years,</font>

606
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,300
<font color="yellow">you've hurt me and I bore it through gritted teeth.</font>

607
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,170
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

608
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,300
<font color="yellow">I will not let you...</font>

609
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,760
<font color="yellow">bully my son.</font>

610
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,860
<font color="yellow">Remember that if you want to die an old man.</font>

611
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,330
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

612
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,800
<font color="yellow">No, Sir. Calm down.</font>

613
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,700
<font color="yellow">You must hold back. Relax.</font>

614
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,260
<font color="yellow">That didn't hurt at all.</font>

615
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,760
<font color="yellow">Right here.</font>

616
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,500
<font color="yellow">My heart.</font>

617
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,470
<font color="yellow">It hurts.</font>

618
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,530
<font color="yellow">I'll get you some cold water.</font>

619
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,860
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

620
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,900
<font color="yellow">I even...</font>

621
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,900
<font color="yellow">get slapped by my own wife.</font>

622
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
<font color="yellow">Mr Han's here.</font>

623
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,460
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me, Sir?</font>

624
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,160
<font color="yellow">I don't care...</font>

625
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,300
<font color="yellow">who you're loyal to or how you rise above others.</font>

626
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,330
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

627
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,390
<font color="yellow">your corrupt way of life threatened my father's life.</font>

628
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,200
<font color="yellow">That, I cannot forgive.</font>

629
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,360
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

630
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,300
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what you mean.</font>

631
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,100
<font color="yellow">His medicine.</font>

632
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,700
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

633
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,360
<font color="yellow">The ones who swapped his medicines...</font>

634
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,700
<font color="yellow">were you and Chairwoman Hwang.</font>

635
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,560
<font color="yellow">In this is a video that shows what you did.</font>

636
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,160
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

637
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
<font color="yellow">I only did what I was told.</font>

638
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,950
<font color="yellow">No excuse can save you now.</font>

639
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,530
<font color="yellow">It's attempted murder.</font>

640
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,830
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.</font>

641
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,630
<font color="yellow">Call the shareholders...</font>

642
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,200
<font color="yellow">for a meeting in her name.</font>

643
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,130
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

644
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,590
<font color="yellow">She can't know about it.</font>

645
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:58,800
<font color="yellow">Do it now.</font>

646
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,730
<font color="yellow">Mr Han.</font>

647
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,390
<font color="yellow">Why does the chairwoman want to see us again?</font>

648
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,300
<font color="yellow">Please wait just a bit longer.</font>

649
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,130
<font color="yellow">You'll find out.</font>

650
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
<font color="yellow">She's running late today.</font>

651
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
<font color="yellow">She's always on time.</font>

652
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,860
<font color="yellow">Are they all here?</font>

653
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,760
<font color="yellow">Yes, every one of them.</font>

654
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,130
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

655
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,100
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who called you.</font>

656
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,160
<font color="yellow">It wasn't Chairwoman Hwang.</font>

657
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,460
<font color="yellow">Mr Han, what's going on?</font>

658
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,700
<font color="yellow">Mr Ko.</font>

659
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,500
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you one question?</font>

660
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,630
<font color="yellow">What do you shareholders fear the most?</font>

661
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,690
<font color="yellow">A drop in the share prices, of course.</font>

662
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,770
<font color="yellow">What could cause the share prices to drop?</font>

663
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,060
<font color="yellow">So many things could.</font>

664
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,600
<font color="yellow">A scandal involving the leader.</font>

665
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,130
<font color="yellow">What effect would that have on the stocks?</font>

666
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,430
<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman Do, what are you trying to tell us?</font>

667
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,330
<font color="yellow">Watch this.</font>

668
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,430
<font color="yellow">- Where are medicines?
-  In here.</font>

669
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,900
<font color="yellow">- They're supplements, right?
-  Yes, Ma'am.</font>

670
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,500
<font color="yellow">Watch the door.</font>

671
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,860
<font color="yellow">What you saw in that video...</font>

672
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,030
<font color="yellow">was Chairwoman Hwang swapping out...</font>

673
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,430
<font color="yellow">her husband's blood pressure medicine.</font>

674
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,000
<font color="yellow">She wanted his title,</font>

675
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,000
<font color="yellow">so she did this to get rid of him.</font>

676
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,800
<font color="yellow">If that video is leaked, Dodo Group's stocks will drop...</font>

677
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,830
<font color="yellow">beyond point of recovery.</font>

678
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,330
<font color="yellow">If you agree...</font>

679
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,860
<font color="yellow">to vote for Hwang Gwi Ja and Do Gwang Woo's dismissal,</font>

680
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,300
<font color="yellow">lift the glass in front of you.</font>

681
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,700
<font color="yellow">If just one of you does not,</font>

682
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,500
<font color="yellow">that video will go viral.</font>

683
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,000
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim.</font>

684
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,960
<font color="yellow">Lift your glass.</font>

685
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,900
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see Dodo crumble?</font>

686
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,770
<font color="yellow">A toast, then.</font>

687
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,060
<font color="yellow">To the reinstatement of Chairman Do Choong.</font>

688
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,760
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
-  Cheers.</font>

689
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,200
<font color="yellow">Will you go, Sir?</font>

690
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,260
<font color="yellow">- What time's the trial?
-  11am.</font>

691
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,700
<font color="yellow">I'll stop by after work.</font>

692
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,340
<font color="yellow">Right. How is Chae Ryung doing?</font>

693
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,860
<font color="yellow">She can't get out unless she can fly or dig underground.</font>

694
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,260
<font color="yellow">I had a strange dream last night.</font>

695
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:36,700
<font color="yellow">If you're calling the care centre, I advise you use the burner phone.</font>

696
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,830
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

697
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,930
<font color="yellow">I forgot.</font>

698
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,030
<font color="yellow">Hurry up, Nan Jeong.</font>

699
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,130
<font color="yellow">I'm ready.</font>

700
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,200
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh! Lawyer Oh!</font>

701
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,760
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh!</font>

702
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,530
<font color="yellow">My investigator friend called. The burner phone's on!</font>

703
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,000
<font color="yellow">Where was it?</font>

704
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,200
<font color="yellow">In Hongeundong.</font>

705
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,130
<font color="yellow">Hongeundong...</font>

706
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,700
<font color="yellow">Hwang Jae Man lives in Hongeundong.</font>

707
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,960
<font color="yellow">So it was them.</font>

708
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,530
<font color="yellow">Let me check.</font>

709
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

710
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,630
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

711
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,260
<font color="yellow">Are you Mr Hang Chi Man?</font>

712
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,500
<font color="yellow">You called the wrong number.</font>

713
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,860
<font color="yellow">No, it is you.</font>

714
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,430
<font color="yellow">Chi Man, it's me, Hong Sik.</font>

715
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,250
<font color="yellow">Your buddy from Yeongdeok.</font>

716
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,960
<font color="yellow">You called the wrong number.</font>

717
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,600
<font color="yellow">It definitely was him.</font>

718
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,270
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim, we just called a burner phone.</font>

719
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,400
<font color="yellow">Could you tell us where it went that day?</font>

720
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,960
<font color="yellow">Jae Man kidnapped her?</font>

721
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,060
<font color="yellow">Yes. According to Lawyer Oh, he went to quite a few places...</font>

722
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,230
<font color="yellow">that day.</font>

723
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,190
<font color="yellow">We can't find her in time for the trial.</font>

724
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,780
<font color="yellow">It seems so.</font>

725
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,960
<font color="yellow">We can't be sure she's still alive.</font>

726
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,300
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

727
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,360
<font color="yellow">I located Chae Ryung.</font>

728
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,800
<font color="yellow">- Where is she?
-  The address belongs...</font>

729
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,510
<font color="yellow">to a care centre in Yongin.</font>

730
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,340
<font color="yellow">That's where she is.</font>

731
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,600
<font color="yellow">She's still alive.</font>

732
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,960
<font color="yellow">Tell Lawyer Oh to postpone the trial and request a warrant...</font>

733
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,300
<font color="yellow">Let the trial happen.</font>

734
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,860
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  Sir.</font>

735
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,360
<font color="yellow">If we apply for a warrant,</font>

736
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,730
<font color="yellow">Il Jae will hear about it.</font>

737
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:04,430
<font color="yellow">That would put Chae Ryung in danger again.</font>

738
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,960
<font color="yellow">But we can't enter the centre without a warrant.</font>

739
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,330
<font color="yellow">We can't bring her back in time for the trial.</font>

740
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,960
<font color="yellow">There is a way.</font>

741
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,800
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

742
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,230
<font color="yellow">Call the local police...</font>

743
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,160
<font color="yellow">and say you witnessed a murder in the care centre.</font>

744
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,860
<font color="yellow">Make a false report?</font>

745
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,100
<font color="yellow">- Can you hire a helicopter?
-  Yes, right away.</font>

746
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,730
<font color="yellow">We'll get there first and wait for them.</font>

747
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:26,500
<font color="yellow">Once the police go in,</font>

748
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,580
<font color="yellow">we can get Chae Ryung out.</font>

749
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,030
<font color="yellow">I'll hire a helicopter right away.</font>

750
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,440
<font color="yellow">Tell Soo Yeon our plan.</font>

751
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,460
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

752
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,500
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Soo Tak.</font>

753
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,040
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan thinks he can bring Chae Ryung over.</font>

754
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,960
<font color="yellow">- Really?
-  He came through in the end.</font>

755
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,010
<font color="yellow">I told you to drop the charges. You love to hassle people.</font>

756
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,360
<font color="yellow">Let her be. The embarrassment from last time wasn't enough.</font>

757
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,000
<font color="yellow">Mayor Byun.</font>

758
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,200
<font color="yellow">I'll call you that only for the duration of the trial.</font>

759
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,000
<font color="yellow">Once it's over, you'll lose the mayoralty...</font>

760
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,900
<font color="yellow">and gain a convict number instead.</font>

761
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,000
<font color="yellow">Enjoy the sweet dream while it lasts.</font>

762
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,560
<font color="yellow">All your scheming to bring me down...</font>

763
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,030
<font color="yellow">has hurt Gun Woo instead.</font>

764
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,130
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

765
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,250
<font color="yellow">He could've become the next chairman if it hadn't been for you.</font>

766
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,260
<font color="yellow">You just ruined his life.</font>

767
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,400
<font color="yellow">Don't talk such nonsense. Gun Woo...</font>

768
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,530
<font color="yellow">See how the general meeting goes.</font>

769
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,130
<font color="yellow">Both Do Choong...</font>

770
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,930
<font color="yellow">and Gun Woo will lose their footing within the company.</font>

771
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,130
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Soo Yeon.</font>

772
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,630
<font color="yellow">I'll reinstate my father at the upcoming meeting.</font>

773
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,560
<font color="yellow">You can focus on today's trial.</font>

774
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,530
<font color="yellow">You do that. Il Jae just tried to shake you into ruining your day.</font>

775
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,600
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Min.</font>

776
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,290
<font color="yellow">Gather the investigators.</font>

777
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,330
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Right now. There's no time.</font>

778
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,460
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

779
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,240
<font color="yellow">You look confident today.</font>

780
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,330
<font color="yellow">Watch me.</font>

781
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,500
<font color="yellow">Bring all the canvassers who worked...</font>

782
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,960
<font color="yellow">for Mr Byun and Mr Cho.</font>

783
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,880
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh, why do you need them?</font>

784
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,530
<font color="yellow">They'll be my witnesses.</font>

785
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,800
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

786
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,360
<font color="yellow">In today's trial, we won't be fighting...</font>

787
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,930
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun or Mr Cho.</font>

788
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,600
<font color="yellow">We're fighting time.</font>

789
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,500
<font color="yellow">- Time?
-  Yes.</font>

790
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,200
<font color="yellow">It's a race against time.</font>

791
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,300
<font color="yellow">The longer the trial goes, the better our chances.</font>

792
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,530
<font color="yellow">We lose if it's too short.</font>

793
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,260
<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

794
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,900
<font color="yellow">Why is a helicopter flying that low?</font>

795
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,660
<font color="yellow">Are you there?</font>

796
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,130
<font color="yellow">We just got here.</font>

797
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,220
<font color="yellow">We'll arrive later than I thought. Can you buy us some time?</font>

798
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,930
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that. Just bring Chae Ryung.</font>

799
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,700
<font color="yellow">The police just arrived.</font>

800
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,700
<font color="yellow">Stay on the phone.</font>

801
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,460
<font color="yellow">Who made the report?</font>

802
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,900
<font color="yellow">I did. This call's for you.</font>

803
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,000
<font color="yellow">- Who is it?
-  Prosecutor Oh Soo Yeon...</font>

804
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,200
<font color="yellow">who is investigating Byun Il Jae.</font>

805
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,960
<font color="yellow">Hello, Prosecutor Oh. I'm Inspector Jang Joon Soo.</font>

806
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,730
<font color="yellow">Sure. Don't worry.</font>

807
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,960
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Oh.</font>

808
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,760
<font color="yellow">The trial's about to start.</font>

809
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:28,100
<font color="yellow">We need to be in touch. Keep texting Mr Min.</font>

810
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,530
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

811
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,560
<font color="yellow">- Let's begin.
-  Sure.</font>

812
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,100
<font color="yellow">It's the police. We're here to investigate.</font>

813
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,100
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

814
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:53,560
<font color="yellow">We received a tip.</font>

815
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,260
<font color="yellow">A tip about what?</font>

816
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,200
<font color="yellow">Where is Ok Chae Ryung?</font>

817
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,660
<font color="yellow">Ok Chae Ryung?</font>

818
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,760
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

819
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,860
<font color="yellow">Ok Chae Ryung!</font>

820
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,500
<font color="yellow">Come back!</font>

821
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,560
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

822
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,300
<font color="yellow">Let's begin...</font>

823
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,830
<font color="yellow">the second trial of the allegations against Mayor Byun.</font>

824
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,160
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Oh, you may begin.</font>

825
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,300
<font color="yellow">Your Honour.</font>

826
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,900
<font color="yellow">I would like to call a new witness.</font>

827
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,400
<font color="yellow">Did you find a new witness?</font>

828
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,700
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

829
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,630
<font color="yellow">Can the witnesses come forward?</font>

830
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,660
<font color="yellow">I found her!</font>

831
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:09,330
<font color="yellow">Stop them.</font>

832
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,430
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

833
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,230
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

834
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,360
<font color="yellow">Sir, she's over here!</font>

835
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,160
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

836
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:36,430
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

837
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,430
<font color="yellow">There's no time to waste.</font>

838
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,200
<font color="yellow">We have to go.</font>

839
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,500
<font color="yellow">- Get up.
-  I told Father about you.</font>

840
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,760
<font color="yellow">Did he tell you what to do?</font>

841
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,830
<font color="yellow">He left it up to me.</font>

842
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,330
<font color="yellow">Without my permission,</font>

843
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,900
<font color="yellow">don't take such a risk again.</font>

844
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:26,270
<font color="yellow">We did not sanction these witnesses.</font>

845
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,200
<font color="yellow">They were canvassers on Mr Byun...</font>

846
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,800
<font color="yellow">and Mr Cho's campaigns.</font>

847
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:34,390
<font color="yellow">We are looking into whether Mr Byun violated the election laws.</font>

848
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,630
<font color="yellow">We need their statements.</font>

849
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:37,860
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor and defendant.</font>

850
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,600
<font color="yellow">Come forward.</font>

851
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

852
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:49,220
<font color="yellow">We'll need a whole day just to question all those people.</font>

853
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,230
<font color="yellow">Your Honour.</font>

854
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,480
<font color="yellow">Not only is the media following this trial,</font>

855
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,930
<font color="yellow">but the president himself is very interested.</font>

856
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,960
<font color="yellow">We cannot accept this.</font>

857
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,670
<font color="yellow">There must be no shred of doubt.</font>

858
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,270
<font color="yellow">If you refuse to question any of those people,</font>

859
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:06,130
<font color="yellow">- then you will face the scorn...
-  Prosecutor Oh.</font>

860
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,330
<font color="yellow">Are you threatening me?</font>

861
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,960
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

862
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,800
<font color="yellow">Return to your seats.</font>

863
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,060
<font color="yellow">I accept the witnesses.</font>

864
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,020
<font color="yellow">What is she trying to do?</font>

865
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,080
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. If they worked for you,</font>

866
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,200
<font color="yellow">it shouldn't be a problem.</font>

867
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,860
<font color="yellow">(Chae Ryung's safe. We'll be there in 90 minutes.)</font>

868
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,810
<font color="yellow">They got Chae Ryung.</font>

869
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:54,400
<font color="yellow">You have to stall for an hour and a half.</font>

870
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,400
<font color="yellow">It should be over by now.</font>

871
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,580
<font color="yellow">Il Jae will finally be appointed as the Mayor of Seoul.</font>

872
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,560
<font color="yellow">I should be here to witness it.</font>

873
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,830
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

874
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,120
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

875
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,130
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

876
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,330
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

877
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:29,900
<font color="yellow">Did you just get here?</font>

878
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,860
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I got to rest and recharge my batteries,</font>

879
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:35,900
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang.</font>

880
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:38,760
<font color="yellow">Let's see what happens.</font>

881
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,860
<font color="yellow">Your son-in-law might become the mayor.</font>

882
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,830
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that...</font>

883
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,260
<font color="yellow">Mr Cho quit his campaign all of a sudden?</font>

884
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,730
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

885
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,200
<font color="yellow">Your Honour.</font>

886
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,440
<font color="yellow">The prosecution is asking the same question 10 times.</font>

887
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,160
<font color="yellow">That's because the witness could give a different answer.</font>

888
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,730
<font color="yellow">Don't you think Soo Yeon's trying to buy time?</font>

889
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know. How would I know?</font>

890
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,130
<font color="yellow">Defendant.</font>

891
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,030
<font color="yellow">Question your witness.</font>

892
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,400
<font color="yellow">I'll pass.</font>

893
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:26,130
<font color="yellow">Then give your final statement.</font>

894
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,730
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung is here. Buy a bit more time.</font>

895
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,130
<font color="yellow">Hang in there.</font>

896
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,700
<font color="yellow">Your Honour, I would like to request one last witness.</font>
