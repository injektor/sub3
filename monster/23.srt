00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
(Episode 23)

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,700
Are you okay?

3
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,900
I'm sorry, Sir.

4
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,030
Tell your boss this.

5
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,660
The one who has the blueprint to MK2 vaccine is...

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,430
not me,

7
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,100
but a man named Byun Il Jae.

8
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,900
Hey, how does this feel?

9
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,930
That hurts.

10
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,330
That hurt.

11
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,400
You punks.

12
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,840
Try doing that on my legs. I think that'll feel better.

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,860
That hurts.

14
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,330
Genesis 9:20.

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,820
James 1:20.

16
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,200
Jeremiah 50:36.

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,060
"Old man"...

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
and "knife"?

19
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,500
Did you say you failed?

20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,860
Yes, Boss.

21
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,530
Why did you fail?

22
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,360
I think he knew about our plan.

23
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,110
From what we've learned,

24
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,790
Gi Tan's abilities are much better than most secret agents.

25
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,000
Ok Chae Ryung.

26
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,130
Why didn't you tell me?

27
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,430
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,200
It's as if we used a rabbit trap...

29
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,320
to catch a leopard.

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,030
Gi Tan continuously claims that Byun Il Jae...

31
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,860
has the blueprint to the vaccine.

32
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,960
From what I've found,

33
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,120
it's definitely not him.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,850
You should look more into it, Boss.

35
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,360
- Byun Il Jae may...
 - Don't you trust our source?

36
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,030
What will you do now?

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,230
I found out about Gi Tan's abilities.

38
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,430
So I'll make a different approach.

39
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,030
Chae Ryung.

40
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,030
It's you.

41
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,400
You told Gi Tan, right?

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,430
Don't say that without any evidence.

43
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,760
I won't let you...

44
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,030
keep betraying our organisation.

45
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,430
Keep that in mind.

46
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,200
Call all of the shareholders and cancel it.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,230
If you don't,

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,560
that meeting will become a place where Gun Woo is praised upon.

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Where's the bottle?

50
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,630
Here it is.

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,730
It looks exactly like the pills which Chairman takes.

52
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,820
However, the ingredients are completely different.

53
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,400
You've been through so much with Gwang Woo, right?

54
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,000
Once Gwang Woo becomes the chairman,

55
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,950
you'll be paid for all of your work.

56
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,220
I am waiting for the day he'll return.

57
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,930
Remember to keep your mouth shut.

58
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,810
I won't ever say a word.

59
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,650
It's a secret from Gwang Woo, too.

60
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,730
Yes, Ma'am.

61
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,660
Go and stand guard.

62
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,130
Yes, Ma'am.

63
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,630
Throw these away, Mr Han.

64
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,700
Yes, Ma'am.

65
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,070
You brought this upon yourself.

66
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,860
It's not my fault.

67
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,160
Where are you going?

68
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,500
I'm going to eat out with Shin Young.

69
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,120
I wanted to eat steak at Dodo Hotel with Mum.

70
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,140
Don't be late. Come back early.

71
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,890
Are you worried about me?

72
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,530
I was talking to Shin Young.

73
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,930
I don't care if you walk in late or stay out all night.

74
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,530
Chairman.

75
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,430
Here are your pills.

76
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,430
What happened to cancelling that shareholders' meeting?

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,330
Oh, I forgot...

78
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,500
to cancel it.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,600
Didn't I order you to do so?

80
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,630
Don't be mad.

81
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,860
Your doctor always told you to watch out for your blood pressure.

82
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,830
I warned you.

83
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,530
If you hold that meeting,

84
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,600
something that you fear the most will happen there.

85
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,400
What I fear the most?

86
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,830
I fear you the most.

87
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,400
You've been very angry recently.

88
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
What if you collapse?

89
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Take care of your health.

90
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,830
Let's go, Shin Young.

91
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,500
Bye, Dad.

92
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,040
I think...

93
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,000
you should cancel the meeting yourself.

94
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,530
I'm waiting around until she cancels it...

95
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,260
on purpose.

96
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,830
Then are you really going to announce...

97
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,430
Gun Woo as your successor at the shareholders' meeting?

98
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,330
Go and find...

99
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,600
where Gun Woo is.

100
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,630
Yes, Chairman.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why aren't you eating?

102
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,800
I didn't know you'd come to a place like this.

103
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,230
I used to come here often...

104
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,430
with your mum.

105
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,830
She loved...

106
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,060
this place's rice soup and steamed meat.

107
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,800
I know that people are...

108
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,600
gossiping very much about you.

109
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,930
If you're fine, I couldn't care less.

110
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,760
Humans are...

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,930
very cunning.

112
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,030
If someone is about 3 to 4 times better than them, they bash him.

113
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,860
If someone is 10 times better, they start to fear him.

114
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,530
If someone is 100 times better, they respect him.

115
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,000
If someone is 1,000 times better,

116
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,260
they get on their knees...

117
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,830
and want to be your slave.

118
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,400
That is how cunning people are.

119
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,800
I know people are insulting you and are jealous,

120
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,260
but there is one thing they don't know.

121
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,170
They don't know how proud I am about you.

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,860
Just wait around a little more.

123
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,300
I will make you...

124
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,260
1000 times better than now.

125
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,330
No one...

126
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,300
will be able to disregard my son.

127
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,360
Welcome.

128
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,360
Where are the shareholders?

129
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,670
They're waiting for you.

130
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,600
Stay seated.

131
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,460
Serve us the VIP course...

132
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,340
along with the best of their wines.

133
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,360
Yes, Ma'am.

134
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,500
I only invited...

135
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,800
the people I value and think dearly of.

136
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,760
Did you all get the notice of the extraordinary general meeting?

137
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,230
Yes,

138
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,400
but would your husband let this happen?

139
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,500
My husband's health has been deteriorating.

140
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,360
Mum, he eats like a horse.

141
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,100
I'm trying to speak.

142
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,670
I'll keep it short.

143
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,830
At the EGM,

144
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,330
vote to dismiss Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo.

145
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,830
(Dodo Group)

146
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,750
What do you want to say?

147
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,930
Doesn't it bother you that Gi Tan was framed for murder?

148
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,760
What's there to be bothered about?

149
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,860
The whole world knows he did it.

150
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,130
Soo Tak.

151
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,030
Do you think I don't know you work for Gun Woo?

152
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,830
What did he offer?

153
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,230
A promotion and a raise?

154
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,330
Did you betray an innocent friend for that?

155
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,030
What are you talking about?

156
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,630
Tell me where Gun Woo put the vaccine's blueprint.

157
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,130
I don't even know what it looks like.

158
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
It's a coded music sheet.

159
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,660
What kind of music sheet...

160
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,160
I don't know anything.

161
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,930
Will you stop lying?

162
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,930
Soo Yeon.

163
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,100
You shouldn't doubt your boss. Not after all he did for you.

164
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,660
You should be grateful.

165
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,560
What a jerk.

166
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,230
The blueprint of the mutant virus vaccine.

167
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,430
That's all we need to set Gi Tan free.

168
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,860
I have something to say. Are you free this evening?

169
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,360
- Should we have dinner?
 - No.

170
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,060
Buy me a drink.

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,860
If you are busy, it doesn't have to be today.

172
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,330
It's fine. Let's leave together.

173
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,800
Thank you.

174
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
What do you have to say?

175
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,430
It was just an excuse to have a drink.

176
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,770
Just don't go overboard.

177
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,300
Shall we have a bet?

178
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,600
Whoever gets drunk first grants the other a wish.

179
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,030
You know I'm a lightweight.

180
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,760
I wouldn't suggest a bet I know I'd lose.

181
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,130
What if I win and demand something extravagant?

182
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,060
What do you...

183
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,370
consider extravagant?

184
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,160
It's something you can't handle.

185
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Then...

186
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,660
is the game on?

187
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,330
The blueprint is a music sheet.

188
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,700
What are you doing?

189
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,430
I was going to help you take off your jacket.

190
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,030
Did you bring me here alone?

191
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,760
Thank you.

192
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,830
I should go.

193
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,900
I have to grant you a wish.

194
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,900
I lost. Tell me what you want.

195
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,830
I'll tell you later.

196
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Goodnight.

197
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,930
Soo Yeon.

198
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,860
How many more times do I have to forgive you?

199
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,030
Guk Cheol.

200
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,700
I trust you, Gi Tan.

201
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,030
I know something is wrong.

202
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,400
So don't ever give up, okay?

203
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,100
Kang Gi Tan.

204
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,060
We're getting him out tomorrow.

205
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,600
How will you do that?

206
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,600
Gosh. The dratted cucumbers made the rest soggy.

207
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,930
First, they'll have a stomach ache.

208
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,800
Dong Yi, call the guard.

209
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,330
- I think I'm going to die.
 - My stomach hurts bad.

210
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,460
Guard!

211
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,160
I think we all have food poisoning!

212
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,300
I think I'll need one more.

213
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
What medicine will they give him?

214
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,830
It's a toxin that slows the pulse...

215
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,370
and causes a shock.

216
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,630
He'll react to it within 24 hours.

217
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
As soon as he's out,

218
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,130
inject him with the antidote.

219
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,300
If you don't, his heart might really stop.

220
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,930
Tell me in detail what I must do.

221
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,100
We will set everything up well in advance.

222
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,430
Take Gi Tan to a safe house...

223
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,870
and steal the blueprint.

224
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,000
That is your duty.

225
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,200
If you fail while helping him escape,

226
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,560
you'll become a criminal.

227
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,410
Don't make any mistakes.

228
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,460
Understood.

229
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,530
Then,

230
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,930
are you saying Gun Woo will be kicked off from his position...

231
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,560
at the next EGM?

232
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,870
That's what I mean.

233
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,760
You won't have to wait too long. Just take it easy.

234
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,170
Mum.

235
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,900
Gi Tan is in my cell.

236
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,370
Kang Ga Din is?

237
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,660
How is he? Is he sick?

238
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,500
Gosh, why are you worried about him and not your brother?

239
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,460
I am.

240
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,000
I was very worried about you, too.

241
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,760
Anyway, can you pull some strings...

242
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,330
to get him out with me?

243
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,480
What are you talking about?

244
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,630
That vaccine blueprint that went missing...

245
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,830
is with him.

246
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,820
Then is he really the killer?

247
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,460
What are you talking about? It's definitely not him.

248
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,930
Mind your own business!

249
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,010
Anyway, once I get my hands on the blueprint,

250
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,560
it doesn't matter if I'm not the heir to the company.

251
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,300
So I really need you to help me.

252
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,900
It won't be easy, but I'll try.

253
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,660
No matter how much it costs,

254
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,930
we have to do it.

255
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,160
Boss.

256
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,900
How was the visit?

257
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,560
You'll be released on special parole with me.

258
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,300
Don't worry.

259
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,330
Good work.

260
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,530
It's okay, you should rest.

261
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,300
Hey... Hey!

262
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Hey!

263
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,430
Gi Tan!

264
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,470
- What's wrong with you?
 - Hey!

265
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,800
Hey!

266
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,500
Gi Tan! Guards!

267
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,400
Guards! Someone's dying!

268
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,860
Gi Tan, you can't die like this.

269
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,250
Where is the vaccine's blueprint?

270
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,180
Gi Tan!

271
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,730
No, please...

272
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Go.

273
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,910
That's not the way to the hospital.

274
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,930
Tail it.

275
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,930
- What was that?
 - Something is suspicious.

276
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,930
Call for backup.

277
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,160
We think the ambulance is trying to escape.

278
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,800
Stop the car!

279
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,800
Excuse me! Stop!

280
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,700
Once you get a hold of Gi Tan,

281
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,430
inject him with this antidote.

282
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,260
Otherwise, his heart might really stop.

283
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,830
Kang Gi Tan, who was sentenced to serve time for murdering...

284
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,930
Na Do Gwang, escaped from prison this afternoon.

285
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,130
Dong Soo, it's time for your medication.

286
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,860
- The police is investigating...
 - It's Guk Cheol!

287
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,500
his whereabouts while collecting witness comments...

288
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,430
and security footages.

289
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,460
They're looking into who the accomplices are.

290
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,360
This just came in.

291
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,760
The accomplice who helped Kang Gi Tan's escape...

292
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,780
was caught on the security camera in the ambulance.

293
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,560
(Accomplice caught on camera)

294
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,130
Isn't that Yoo Sung Ae from the secretary's office?

295
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,830
It is.

296
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,360
What's going to happen to them?

297
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,230
Now that her face is revealed, they'll be caught soon.

298
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,130
What about Gi Tan?

299
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,550
If he gets additional punishment, his sentence will get longer.

300
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,760
What a fool.

301
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,460
Why did he escape?

302
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,460
Gosh.

303
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,460
Yes, Vice Chairman.

304
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,760
I'm on my way from meeting with a cipher officer.

305
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,830
The person is talented, but I'm not sure about their background.

306
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,030
Okay, Sir.

307
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,530
A cipher officer?

308
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,660
There are secret codes on the music sheet.

309
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Soo Yeon...

310
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,700
was telling me the truth.

311
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,030
What on earth did you do?

312
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Because of you,

313
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,700
the NIS is in trouble.

314
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I'm sorry.

315
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,300
It's my fault.

316
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,930
What about Gi Tan?

317
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,130
He'll wake up soon.

318
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,560
Do everything in your means...

319
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,460
to get that blueprint from Gi Tan.

320
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,010
What will happen to me?

321
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,130
A secret agent's face...

322
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,130
was on national television.

323
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
What do you think?

324
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,100
Once this job is done,

325
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,160
you'll be sent abroad.

326
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,860
Got that?

327
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,210
There's a limit to how much we can stop the police.

328
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,560
Don't take too long.

329
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,260
Wasn't this mission...

330
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,820
a deal made with the police?

331
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,230
I told you it was a secret mission. A secret mission!

332
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,860
That's why it's such a headache.

333
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,860
Anyway,

334
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,230
just do as I tell you.

335
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,300
I'll figure out the rest.

336
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Yes, Sir.

337
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,860
Right.

338
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Gi Tan...

339
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
will claim that Byun Il Jae is the suspect.

340
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,430
Don't trust him.

341
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,650
Sung Ae?

342
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,700
Are you awake?

343
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,100
Are you also with Huaping?

344
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Are you dreaming? Huaping?

345
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,630
How did you get me out?

346
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,930
I sacrificed my life for it. It wasn't easy.

347
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,360
- Happy?
 - Sung Ae...

348
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,930
There's police everywhere.

349
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,800
You'll be caught as soon as you set foot outside.

350
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,650
Stay here for a while until things quiet down.

351
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,800
I'll look for routes for you to escape after that.

352
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,530
People around you are being watched upon.

353
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,660
Do not think about contacting them.

354
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,000
I don't care who you are.

355
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,700
I don't have the blueprint.

356
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,030
You're doing this in vain.

357
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,060
I will return to the prison.

358
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,300
All right?

359
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,760
Who are you?

360
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,230
Let's not make this hard on us.

361
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,190
If you're not with Huaping, who are you?

362
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,360
I'm with the National Intelligence Service.

363
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,930
The National Intelligence Service?

364
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,660
Where is the blueprint?

365
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,000
The police, Huaping and now, it's the NIS.

366
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,830
I'm a big boy, am I not?

367
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,330
Tell me.

368
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,560
Where is it?

369
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,000
Why did you give the MK2 vaccine to that woman?

370
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,560
Even when things go wrong,

371
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,900
we can't come out to the open.

372
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,930
Gi Tan may run.

373
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,930
The moment he runs,

374
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,130
I'll get him with my own hands.

375
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,830
I feel so nervous.

376
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,300
Gi Tan will...

377
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,700
try to get back at us.

378
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,400
He can't come out to the open because he's on the run.

379
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
He's a dangerous man.

380
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,160
If the police couldn't get him,

381
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,430
you should get him, Il Jae.

382
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,730
That's what I was going to do.

383
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,900
What happened to finding Cha Jeong Eun?

384
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,700
There is a patient I'm suspicious about.

385
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,900
Her brother has a very unique disease.

386
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,300
Everything else is the same, but his name is Oh Jin Cheol.

387
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,130
Go and find out.

388
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,330
Guk Cheol broke out from prison.

389
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,330
I'm sure he'll go find Jeong Eun.

390
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,630
Yes, Sir.

391
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,730
Wait.

392
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,360
I have something to give to you.

393
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,130
What is this?

394
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,130
When someone's shot with that,

395
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,760
their heart will slowly stop.

396
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,730
Should I inject this...

397
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,560
He'll be a problem to us as long as he's alive.

398
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,360
It's better to kill him.

399
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,460
(Oh Jin Cheol)

400
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,830
Kang Gi Tan and Yoo Sung Ae are yet to be found.

401
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,430
The police believe that they are still near Seoul.

402
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,530
They have increased security...

403
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,700
- among all streets.
 - Guk Cheol is here again.

404
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
It's Guk Cheol.

405
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,930
Does Gi Tan really have a woman?

406
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,500
I'm not sure,

407
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,830
but I think they were childhood sweethearts.

408
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,200
(Oh Choong Dong)

409
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,130
What happened?

410
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,100
I found Jeong Eun's brother.

411
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,900
We'll be there. Send me the address.

412
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,560
You're here.

413
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Do you want a drink?

414
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,760
I don't have time to drink with you.

415
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,300
What is it?

416
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,930
My father...

417
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,230
recently passed away.

418
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,770
The hospital said...

419
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,160
that he'd live for another five months,

420
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,230
but he suddenly passed away.

421
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,930
He lived his whole life...

422
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,200
as a guard in an apartment.

423
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,400
He was really glad to hear that I started working...

424
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,560
for a big name company.

425
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,530
My father...

426
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,030
passed away because of me.

427
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,330
I did too many...

428
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,460
bad things to Gi Tan.

429
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,000
It feels like my father was...

430
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,200
punished for everything that I've done.

431
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,460
I'm sorry, Soo Yeon.

432
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,300
I apologise.

433
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,430
I have nothing I can do for Gi Tan.

434
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,230
You can retrieve the blueprint from Gun Woo.

435
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,800
Gi Tan can't be proven innocent with that.

436
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,330
It can. I will take care of the rest.

437
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,400
Just make sure you get the blueprint.

438
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,560
If it goes wrong, you can just quit work.

439
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,500
But for Gi Tan, this is a matter of life and death.

440
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,330
Okay, I'll try.

441
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,130
I will...

442
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,500
get that blueprint.

443
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Thank you.

444
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,600
Is that Jeong Eun's brother?

445
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,000
I heard him say Guk Cheol's name.

446
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,500
I guess Jeong Eun will be here any second.

447
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,830
I'll call you as soon as I see her.

448
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,930
Okay. Thank you, Choong Dong.

449
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,770
Wait one second.

450
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,060
It's Oh Soo Yeon.

451
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,360
I'm here, Dong Soo.

452
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,830
You're here!

453
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,460
(Oh Jin Cheol)

454
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,000
I brought some fried food.

455
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,630
I love fried food. I want it.

456
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,160
I knew she'd be someone near Gi Tan.

457
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,270
But I can't believe Oh Soo Yeon was Cha Jeong Eun.

458
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,400
- Keep your eyes on her.
 - Yes, Sir.

459
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,330
Is it really that good?

460
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,030
Did Soo Yeon ever act suspiciously?

461
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,230
- Was she interested in the vaccine?
 - Not... Not at all.

462
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
If it seems like...

463
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,130
she knows something about our secret,

464
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,330
you must do something.

465
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,700
We're working on something big here.

466
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,330
We can't let this go down with a small glitch like her.

467
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,800
Don't worry. Nothing like that will happen.

468
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,800
What about the person who can decode the blueprint?

469
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,420
I'm looking for one.

470
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,330
Many people are after this. Keep it low.

471
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,900
You got through this very well.

472
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,770
If I say that it hurts,

473
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,930
it'll only make you feel bad.

474
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,560
We found out who Gi Tan is.

475
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,200
He is an industrial spy.

476
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,230
He wanted to take the blueprint...

477
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,830
and sell it to the Chinese market,

478
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,630
but he killed someone on the way.

479
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,830
Get a grip, Sung Ae.

480
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,660
Gi Tan is a murderer.

481
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,160
Don't feel sorry for him.

482
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,630
It's all useless.

483
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,030
Where is the blueprint?

484
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Water...

485
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,100
Give me some water.

486
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,930
I told you, Il Jae has it.

487
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,800
Where is...

488
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,560
the blueprint?

489
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Please...

490
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,700
Please, just let me sleep.

491
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,530
If you give me the blueprint,

492
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,460
I'll help you out of the country.

493
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,700
That's the only way you can live.

494
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,270
Il Jae...

495
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,160
Gun Woo...

496
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,300
I already told you that they have it.

497
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,400
I despise...

498
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,830
people like you.

499
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,820
You only care about yourself.

500
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,630
How can you think about selling such a thing to another country?

501
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,270
Sung Ae...

502
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,270
Let me ask you again.

503
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,330
Where is...

504
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
the blueprint?

505
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,230
I told you that Il Jae has it!

506
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,450
Speak.

507
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,830
Are you sure...

508
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,160
Gi Tan has it?

509
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,560
I'm sure.

510
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,100
It's impossible to get him to confess.

511
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,430
We need a new strategy or...

512
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,430
Or what?

513
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
Never mind.

514
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,000
Stop the interrogation until I give you the next order.

515
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,910
The truth serum didn't work,

516
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,750
and he withstood all the torture.

517
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,400
I think he's had special training.

518
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,130
Did you train him?

519
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,030
Yes.

520
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,060
You sure spent...

521
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,880
a lot of time on him.

522
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,300
What he claims might be true.

523
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,460
I'm telling you that it's not Il Jae.

524
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,130
There's nothing to lose.

525
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,230
We should check, Boss.

526
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,630
Contact Kim Dae Ho...

527
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,630
- to set the time.
 - Yes, Sir.

528
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,130
Isn't he the president of a company in the defence industry?

529
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,370
You're right.

530
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,030
We're in the same industry, so we know each other.

531
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,800
I see.

532
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,160
That makes sense.

533
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,770
Is he that big of a deal?

534
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,900
If I'm a pebble in the defence industry,

535
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,330
he's a star in the sky.

536
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,000
I heard he has a strong network in China as well.

537
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,500
It's not just China.

538
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,430
He knows people in the Middle East and Europe, too.

539
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,970
You should get to meet him while he's in the country.

540
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,300
He'll be a big help to you.

541
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,730
I heard you're from Hong Kong.

542
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,660
Your Korean is excellent.

543
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,530
I had a lot of businesses with Korea.

544
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,400
What brings you to Korea?

545
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,740
I heard there is a professor who found a vaccine for MK2.

546
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,550
I came to make a deal with him.

547
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:11,560
I believe that professor was murdered a few months ago.

548
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,660
I'm not talking about Na Do Gwang.

549
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,060
There is another professor that was studying the virus with him.

550
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,540
That's a relief.

551
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,000
I heard there are a lot of people dying from the mutant virus in Asia.

552
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,830
Please let me know if you need anything during your stay.

553
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,650
I'll do my best to give you good hospitality.

554
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,400
I'll be asking for your help if I need it.

555
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,430
It's not him.

556
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,660
How do you know?

557
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,100
His eyes didn't shake once.

558
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,160
Kang Gi Tan.

559
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,860
He lied to us.

560
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:07,530
We almost...

561
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,550
fell for Jo Gi Ryang's tricks.

562
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,700
How did you know that he was Gi Ryang?

563
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,840
I have an informant.

564
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,930
An informant?

565
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,930
Mr Yeon, come on in.

566
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,300
Long time no see, Sir.

567
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Come.

568
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,300
Gi Tan...

569
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,300
is currently kidnapped by Gi Ryang?

570
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Yes, Sir.

571
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
Then...

572
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,250
is it Gi Ryang's men who helped him escape from prison?

573
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,300
Yes, that's right.

574
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,900
Since he doesn't have the blueprint, he'll die soon.

575
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,000
That's good news.

576
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,600
Thanks to Mr Yeon, we were able to avoid a big trap.

577
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,830
I'm sick of working in the shades.

578
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,650
When do you plan on bringing me back?

579
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,430
Once this job is over,

580
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,600
you'll get what you want.

581
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,000
Thank you, Sir.

582
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,930
Go to the United States for two months of training.

583
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,720
What's this all of a sudden?

584
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,130
Once you land, someone from our office there will greet you.

585
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,900
I can't go.

586
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,560
Soo Yeon.

587
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,500
It's my resignation letter.

588
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,460
I won't work under you any more.

589
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,130
If you leave like this,

590
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,330
I won't ever ask you to stay.

591
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,500
That's just what I wanted.

592
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,930
I thought you wouldn't ask me to stay.

593
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,300
What are you doing? Let me go!

594
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,560
What's wrong with you?

595
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,230
I don't know! I really don't.

596
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,500
But I just think I should do this.

597
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,700
If I let you go like this,

598
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,260
I might lose you forever...

599
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,060
like I did with my mum.

600
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,760
I might go crazy.

601
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,560
Whether I die or not,

602
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,030
it's none of your business.

603
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,160
Whether you go crazy or not,

604
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,400
it's none of my business.

605
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,260
Do you get it now?

606
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,230
I don't like you.

607
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,930
Let's never see each other again.

608
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,700
I don't have the blueprint. You're wasting your time.

609
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,260
Gi Tan.

610
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,700
I'll take the car.

611
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,330
Don't move.

612
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,660
You're a fugitive.

613
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,000
I have no problem...

614
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,030
shooting you.

615
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Then shoot me.

616
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,930
Do you think I won't?

617
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,800
Shoot.

618
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,260
I don't fear death.

619
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,330
Stop right there.

620
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:52,760
Who are you?

621
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:02,700
He tried to escape.

622
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,830
Where should I take him?

623
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,060
I want you...

624
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,230
to get him to confess.

625
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,430
Are you not confident?

626
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,560
- No, Sir.
 - I sincerely hope...

627
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,860
you won't let me down.

628
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,600
He's testing me.

629
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,100
What should I do?

630
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,730
(Prison)

631
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,060
Welcome back.

632
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,100
- Thanks.
 - Have some tofu.

633
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,830
Gi Tan.

634
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,200
Where is he now?

635
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,130
He's still on the run. No one knows where he is.

636
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,800
Chief Secretary, use all your resources...

637
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,260
and find him immediately.

638
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,030
What for? The police are looking.

639
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,760
Just do as I say.

640
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,300
I have my reasons and they are good reasons.

641
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,330
Yes, Sir. Your father is waiting for you at home.

642
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,360
Before I go home,

643
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,100
I'll drop by the office.

644
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,460
The office, Sir?

645
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,130
Very well, then. I'll drive you.

646
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,700
Good morning, Sir.

647
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,900
I have a list of secretary candidates.

648
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,600
Once you accept Soo Yeon's resignation...

649
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,660
She took time off.

650
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,270
- Pardon?
 - Say it's paid leave.

651
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,000
She'll get paid for taking a break.

652
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,430
Leave her seat vacant for now.

653
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,660
Yes, Sir.

654
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:27,260
(Dodo Group)

655
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,200
Why do you look so surprised?

656
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,630
Aren't you happy to see me?

657
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,930
Move your feet.

658
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,930
What?

659
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,230
I work for the company.

660
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,160
Insulting my seat means you're insulting the company.

661
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,700
You got better at talking back.

662
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,100
You rode my father's coattails all the way to the top.

663
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:05,430
Do you actually think you're a vice chairman?

664
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,930
While you did time for ruining our reputation,

665
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,930
I worked very hard for the company.

666
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,860
You have no right to mock me, Brother.

667
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,200
"Brother"?

668
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,830
Who's your brother?

669
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:31,260
I see you're trying to squeeze into our little family.

670
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,660
I'm in no mood to put up with your antics.

671
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,530
So get out of my room in silence.

672
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,560
Are you high? Or insane?

673
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,630
Please, just go!

674
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,500
Don't bug me.

675
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,300
I don't know what I might do.

676
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,600
How dare you?

677
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,570
- You...
 - I warned you.

678
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,700
Don't touch me!

679
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:10,600
How dare the son of a mistress even touch me?

680
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,630
Yes, my mother was the other woman.

681
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,190
So what?

682
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,300
You jerk.

683
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,500
What are you doing?

684
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,630
Did you see that?

685
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,460
He tried to kill me. He beat me up!

686
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,160
Shall I tell your father that your little brother hit you?

687
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,630
What?

688
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,400
If you don't apologise right now,

689
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,360
I will report this!

690
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,760
I don't want an apology.

691
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,260
I will remember this for the rest of my life.

692
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,400
I hope you do the same as well.

693
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,700
Whatever I do to you down the line...

694
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,730
won't make you feel so bad.

695
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,800
Gi Tan.

696
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,360
Wake up.

697
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,030
Who are they?

698
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,100
Are they Huaping?

699
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:15,730
I think so.

700
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,060
What are they?

701
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,230
It's your last chance.

702
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,500
Where is...

703
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,500
the blueprint.

704
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,300
It's not...

705
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,530
with me.

706
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:06,860
I have...

707
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,500
a special skill...

708
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:12,760
that makes people talk.

709
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,100
What are you doing?

710
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,330
Untie me! Stop!

711
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:26,860
Let me go!

712
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,030
How many pain spots...

713
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,800
do you think are on a human body?

714
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,800
There are more than you think.

715
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,700
And the pain...

716
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,000
is beyond belief.

717
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,800
People fear extreme pain...

718
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,730
more than death itself.

719
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,030
And that fear...

720
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,800
makes them tell the truth.

721
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,160
It will be beyond anything you can bear.

722
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:46,900
Gi Tan!

723
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:48,860
Gi Tan!

724
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,530
One more.

725
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,100
Drag it on for too long...

726
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,130
and you could die.

727
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,360
Tell me.

728
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:38,930
Continue.

729
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,030
It's too dangerous.

730
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,570
He could die.

731
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,630
Do it!

732
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,600
You can't...

733
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,900
use pain to change the truth.

734
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,830
Do it!

735
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,800
(Monster)

736
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,500
Is your name Dong Soo?

737
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,150
Did you draw this?

738
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:02,300
I told you to leave Soo Yeon alone.

739
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,300
Gi Tan will show up.

740
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,360

745
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,050
Get me to the States.
