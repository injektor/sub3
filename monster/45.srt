1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,310
I think...

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,540
we might be able to find proof...

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,670
that Il Jae killed your parents.

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,310
(Il Jae, Dodo, the director's death, the secret's in Pandora's Box)

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,500
"Pandora's Box"?

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,420
The doctor who conducted the autopsy said...

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,670
he stored all information inside the Pandora's Box.

8
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,810
Do you mean the one who did Dong Soo's autopsy?

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,810
Yes. He was a researcher at Sudo Hospital...

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,040
back in 2005.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,550
He used to work as an inspector with Guk Cheol's parents...

12
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,740
at Dodo Pharmaceutical for painkillers made...

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,140
with stem cells.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,370
If you just close your eyes and take their side this once,

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,100
we'll get 20 million dollars.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,110
Man Ok.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,840
This is about handing over half of our management rights.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,940
That's not closing our eyes just this once.

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,010
You know best about the finances of our hospital.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,190
Man Ok.

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,010
You also know that...

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,810
we are currently inspecting Dodo Pharmaceutical's pills.

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,820
Asking us to work with them is...

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,140
to tamper with the inspection results.

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,140
Only if we find out where this Pandora's Box is,

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,970
we may be able to find the evidence...

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,170
of Il Jae's committing murder.

28
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,870
I'm sure...

29
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,140
it's among those who are related to Dodo Group.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,440
- Open!
 -  You can't go in.

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,510
Move!

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,310
You can't do this!

33
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,020
I thought I told you not to barge into my office.

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,310
Gun Woo, it's not late.

35
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,800
Hand me over the documents from Chairman Do's secret safe.

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,510
We already had this talk.

37
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,710
If you don't listen to me, I'll make sure you regret it.

38
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,410
I can't give it to you because I don't want to regret it.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,210
Gun Woo, you...

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,770
What are you doing? Take him out of here!

41
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,030
Please leave.

42
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,110
Let go!

43
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,840
Gun Woo. You better think carefully...

44
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,110
about what I said.

45
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,470
Call the secretary's office...

46
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,010
and make sure they don't allow Il Jae in the building.

47
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,010
Yes, Sir.

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,870
Why did Il Jae come here?

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,540
You know it too, don't you? He's been threatening me...

50
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,610
He's been threatening me with my weakness.

51
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,510
Can't you tell me what that weakness is?

52
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,540
It's regarding my mother. I'll tell you everything later.

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,070
Anyway, why are you here?

54
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,240
We found something strange among the medical examiner's belongings.

55
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,070
What do you mean?

56
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,680
Pandora's Box?

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,870
Yes. If we find that,

58
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,040
we can get Il Jae arrested for murder.

59
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,060
I think Chairman Do might know.

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,710
But it's a little difficult to ask since Gwang Woo might be involved.

61
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,670
Father should know if it's something like that.

62
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,070
I'll ask him once the surgery is over.

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,540
Yes, Producer Choi. Did you get the files I sent you?

64
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,440
No, we're not sure who has the Pandora's Box yet.

65
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,570
We'll track it down as we record the show.

66
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,280
Okay, I'll come by the studio right now.

67
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,740
Bye.

68
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,610
Soo Yeon, I think it's too dangerous to air it on television.

69
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,910
I'll work on it and...

70
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,840
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

71
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,570
If that file gets into Lawyer Oh's hands,

72
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,560
Il Jae will take back the money we need for the matured bonds.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,640
I know that.

74
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,280
Once the inheritance is sorted out and the company is stable again,

75
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,040
I'll hand these files to Soo Yeon.

76
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,370
I hear...

77
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,910
you're getting surgery tomorrow.

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,510
This...

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,610
might end up being my last meal.

80
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,780
I didn't expect you to invite me for such an occasion.

81
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,570
A couple may end their relationship by law,

82
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,540
but that's not the case for friends.

83
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,940
Friends?

84
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,580
We spent years together through conflicts.

85
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,670
If we're not friends, then what are we?

86
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,270
If you thought that way,

87
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,640
I should thank you.

88
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,010
Now that I'm knocking on my death's door,

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,040
life doesn't seem so complicated any more.

90
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,810
Your soup will get cold.

91
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,410
Please don't hesitate to talk about what you want to.

92
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,310
Dodo Group...

93
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,810
will support you for the election.

94
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,410
I might die.

95
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,170
I have no ulterior motives.

96
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,640
I'm thankful for your generosity,

97
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,610
but please do not bother helping me.

98
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,140
Listen, Congressman Hwang.

99
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,210
Did you...

100
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,070
change your mind...

101
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,070
now that I'm a strong candidate?

102
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,070
Friendship or partnership, they all depend on timing.

103
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,410
You're not helping me. It's the other way around.

104
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,510
Congressman Hwang.

105
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,840
Does it look like I'm asking you for a favour?

106
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,240
Then are you telling me...

107
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,800
that you're being sincere?

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,610
I don't have the power to save my life,

109
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,910
but I can easily...

110
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,540
control yours.

111
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,670
I'll save you a front row seat for my inaugural ceremony,

112
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,910
so please don't die.

113
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,710
I hope you get to see...

114
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,210
who the final winner is.

115
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,940
I was always treated by you,

116
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,470
so let me get this round.

117
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,070
This might be your last meal after all.

118
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,040
Take your time...

119
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,270
and enjoy it.

120
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,010
The winner?

121
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,510
Hwang Jae Man.

122
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,040
Money, wealth and honour...

123
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
are all but an empty dream.

124
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,110
I'll make sure...

125
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
I get...

126
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,940
to help you understand that.

127
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,830
Are you saying Chairman Do is involved...

128
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,910
in the murder of Chairman Kang's parents?

129
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,510
Chairman Do...

130
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,640
must have let Gwang Woo's crime slide.

131
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,240
If you look back at the T9 incident,

132
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,610
he could have concealed the truth on purpose.

133
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,410
That's why you're trying so hard to take over Dodo Group.

134
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,070
Did you say Gun Woo was able to open Do Choong's safe with a warrant?

135
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,410
Yes, that's what the bank teller said.

136
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,510
Do you think the Pandora's Box...

137
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,570
could be Chairman Do's secret safe?

138
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,070
Potentially.

139
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,170
That's a big problem.

140
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,710
Gun Woo already opened it.

141
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,640
These are all assumptions for now.

142
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,640
We'll figure things out now.

143
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,210
Welcome, Chairman Kang.

144
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,810
How are you feeling?

145
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,040
Very good. I'm of sound mind.

146
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,210
Thank you for bringing Dr Campbell, Gi Tan.

147
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,340
I thought you were against the surgery. Did you change your mind?

148
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm relieved after meeting with Dr Campbell.

149
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,380
I think the surgery will go well tomorrow.

150
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,840
Could I ask you something, Sir?

151
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,540
What is it?

152
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,210
What's in your personal safe...

153
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,340
at Bando Bank?

154
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,840
Why are you asking me about that?

155
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,140
Gun Woo opened your safe...

156
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,380
with a warrant.

157
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,380
Did you really...

158
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
sign that warrant?

159
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,810
Don't you remember? You...

160
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,010
I remember.

161
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,040
It's true. I wrote him the warrant.

162
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,010
In the case...

163
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,500
that I die from the surgery,

164
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,510
someone has...

165
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,380
to open that safe.

166
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,520
I'm so tired.

167
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,810
I better sleep.

168
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,710
I'll see you tomorrow.

169
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,270
Did I...

170
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,770
really write...

171
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,870
that warrant?

172
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,870
Here's the warrant.

173
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,140
(I, Do Choong, allow Do Gun Woo the permission to access my safe.)

174
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,370
This is definitely your handwriting.

175
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,340
Then...

176
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,140
you must have seen what's inside.

177
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,470
It was something that no one else should see.

178
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,640
Gun Woo.

179
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,040
If...

180
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,540
I do not wake up after the surgery,

181
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,640
leave out the parts about Jae Man...

182
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,670
and burn the rest.

183
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,770
When you face...

184
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,610
difficulties as you run this company,

185
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,370
those documents about Jae Man's corruption...

186
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,970
will be of great help to you.

187
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,940
I understand.

188
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,640
How did you know I went to Bando Bank with that paper?

189
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,030
Have you been tailing me?

190
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,440
What was inside his secret safe?

191
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,240
Why do you want to know?

192
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,770
Because I think the Pandora's Box may lie in that safe.

193
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,110
If you're hiding it,

194
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,570
that means you've teamed up with Il Jae again.

195
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,670
You're wrong.

196
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,410
I'm going to find that Box and hand it to Soo Yeon.

197
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,540
How long do you think you can fool everyone?

198
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,240
I don't care if you fool everyone else.

199
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,940
But I won't forgive you...

200
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,140
if you fool Soo Yeon.

201
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,040
Soo Yeon is my fiancée.

202
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,710
Someone like you do not deserve to mention her name.

203
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,680
Listen closely, Gun Woo.

204
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,370
I will rip off your dirty mask...

205
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,640
in front of Soo Yeon very soon.

206
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,460
Are you all prepared to hide away Father?

207
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,590
Don't worry about it.

208
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,940
Have you ever seen me make a mistake?

209
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,750
Okay. I will trust you, Mr Yang.

210
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,310
Yes, okay.

211
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,430
Gun Woo probably won't stay quiet. Will this be okay?

212
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,640
Don't worry, Mum.

213
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,640
No one will find Father there.

214
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,740
Gwang Woo.

215
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,020
Only if we get our inheritance as it's written in his previous will,

216
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,770
we have nothing to worry about.

217
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,120
Gun Woo will not get...

218
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,770
a penny.

219
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,710
All of his work will go in vain.

220
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,240
You're so smart.

221
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,640
You're so good at these kind of stuff.

222
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,970
I'm not sure.

223
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,310
I think these kinds of things come...

224
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,560
whenever I get cornered.

225
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,470
These kind of wisdom just pops into my head out of nowhere.

226
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,170
Maybe this is an illness.

227
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,450
That's what people call a genius.

228
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,540
You've been gifted from above.

229
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,540
Only if Father had recognised me for who I am,

230
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,070
I wouldn't be doing such a thing.

231
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,540
My gosh.

232
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,670
Gwang Woo is completely fooled by me.

233
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,840
(Iris Identification)

234
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,410
(Transfer Confirmed)

235
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,510
(Your transfer has been successfully completed.)

236
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,040
I just sent you 100,000 dollars as front money.

237
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
You'll get the rest when everything is over.

238
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,770
Sure.

239
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,470
Sir.

240
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,710
One of my dreams as a child was to run a hotel.

241
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,240
Can you give me...

242
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,670
a bit of Dodo Hotel's shares?

243
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,480
You'll be getting all of Chairman Do's assets.

244
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,340
You can do that much for me.

245
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,010
I'll think about it.

246
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,170
Make sure you do.

247
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,970
If it wasn't for me, how would you receive such...

248
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,070
I said, I got it.

249
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,640
I trust you, Sir.

250
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,560
Dong Yi is such a pig.

251
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,300
He even wants Dodo Hotel.

252
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,910
As you know, talking about a crime does not make them guilty.

253
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,770
Let them make their move as planned.

254
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,110
When Dong Yi hands over Chairman Do to Gun Woo,

255
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,010
we'll get them.

256
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,970
That's the most effective way to let the world know...

257
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,810
about Gun Woo and Gwang Woo's crime.

258
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,640
I feel bad for Chairman Do.

259
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,710
All of his children except for Shin Young...

260
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,470
wishes that he dies.

261
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,670
He earned that.

262
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,140
He chased after money his entire life.

263
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,010
He has to go.

264
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,870
Dad.

265
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Yes?

266
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,370
Don't worry.

267
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,010
I won't die easily.

268
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,310
I'm not worried. Things will all go well.

269
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,910
I believe you.

270
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,470
Shin Young.

271
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,010
Make sure Gwang Woo and your mum...

272
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,050
don't come...

273
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,940
near the hospital, please.

274
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,170
Okay.

275
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,870
Gun Woo.

276
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,040
Whatever happens,

277
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,870
you have to keep the company steady.

278
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,140
Yes, Father.

279
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,970
I will start the anaesthesia.

280
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,340
Anaesthesia is complete.

281
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,050
All right, then. Let's begin the operation.

282
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,740
Switch on the music, please.

283
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,940
Scalpel, please.

284
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,910
What is it, Mr Han?

285
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm here at the annex parking lot with Mr Yang and his people.

286
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,080
Okay.

287
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
Yes, Mr Moon.

288
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,270
I'm at the parking lot in the annex.

289
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,910
Mr Han and Dong Yi are together.

290
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,810
You should greet them when the person arrives.

291
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,640
How many do we have?

292
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,460
I thought we may end up getting in a fight,

293
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,350
so I brought some strong ones.

294
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,470
Okay, then.

295
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,540
Goodness.

296
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,810
What's taking the surgery so long?

297
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,210
My gosh.

298
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,340
Hey.

299
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,210
How much longer do I have to wait?

300
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,550
Call the anaesthetist...

301
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,760
right now.

302
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,670
She's in the surgery room. I can't call her.

303
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,970
I'm waiting at the parking lot in the main building.

304
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,320
Give me a call as soon as she calls you.

305
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,580
All right, don't worry about it.

306
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,910
He's completely fooled.

307
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,270
My goodness.

308
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,670
(Doctor Kim)

309
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,450
What happened?

310
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,120
Chairman Do's surgery is finished.

311
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,510
Come to the recovery room in 20 minutes.

312
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,330
How is he?

313
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,370
Well, the operation was successful.

314
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,970
Then is the amnesia completely better?

315
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,850
Well, he probably won't suffer from amnesia.

316
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,770
However, he might have some problems with...

317
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,560
paralysis and speech problems.

318
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,710
But it can be overcome with therapy.

319
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,950
Okay, thanks. Thanks a lot.

320
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,010
Okay, you're welcome.

321
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,700
Where's Dad?

322
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,060
He's in the recovery room.

323
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,910
I'll call you once the patient is up.

324
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,110
I'm so relieved.

325
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,650
Ga Din, aren't you hungry?

326
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,310
I have to go somewhere.

327
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,310
You should eat with Mr Gong.

328
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,440
You must be starving. Let's go eat.

329
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,240
Patient Do is having a cardiac arrest!

330
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,170
Prepare for CPR.

331
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,910
200 joules.

332
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,310
Shoot.

333
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,410
300 joules.

334
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,370
Shoot.

335
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,970
9:28am. I pronounce Patient Do Choong...

336
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
dead.

337
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,270
What's this?

338
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,970
What happened?

339
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,410
Chairman Do disappeared.

340
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,570
What happened?

341
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,570
What do you mean he's gone?

342
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,970
He should be in the recovery room, but he's not!

343
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,540
It's me.

344
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,840
Things have gone astray.

345
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,440
No, it's not that.

346
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,610
What's going on? Why did they just come out?

347
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,970
It's taking longer than I thought.

348
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,390
Yes. They should be here by now.

349
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,110
Who came from Gwang Woo's side?

350
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,110
We're keep a good eye on them. If someone arrives from their side,

351
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,340
we'll be informed.

352
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,970
Yes, Sir.

353
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,910
Things didn't work out. You should return to the office.

354
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,240
Yes, Sir.

355
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,770
Mr Han is leaving.

356
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,840
Have someone follow him.

357
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,110
Follow the car that just exited.

358
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,240
Yes, Soo Tak. Go ahead.

359
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,610
What?

360
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,570
Okay.

361
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,940
What happened?

362
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,570
Dong Yi came out empty-handed.

363
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,670
- He didn't have Chairman Do?
 -  No.

364
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,870
Chairman Do disappeared.

365
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,430
You said Dong Yi came out empty-handed.

366
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,370
It seems like someone else...

367
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,240
got there before he did.

368
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,470
- Check on Gwang Woo.
 -  Yes, Sir.

369
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,360
You said the chairman died.

370
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,310
How can a dead man disappear?

371
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,970
I'm sorry. We're trying to figure it out,

372
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,270
so please calm down.

373
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,010
Shin Young.

374
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,210
Gi Tan. Dad...

375
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,510
I heard the news.

376
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,270
I feel like I'm dreaming.

377
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,540
I'm not myself right now.

378
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,370
I'll find out what happened. Go home and rest.

379
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,470
Mr Gong, please take Shin Young home.

380
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,810
We better do that.

381
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,310
Let's go, Shin Young.

382
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,640
Come on.

383
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,580
I have no leads.

384
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,110
If it's not Gwang Woo or Gun Woo, who could it be?

385
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,470
Go secure the CCTV footage.

386
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,810
Yes, Sir.

387
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,810
Why are you doing this to me?

388
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,710
I really have nothing to do with it.

389
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,210
If you don't, who does?

390
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,740
That's why this is so strange.

391
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,870
Did you side with Gwang Woo?

392
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,510
No way. Please trust me on this.

393
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,270
It's Gwang Woo.

394
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,270
- Put it on speaker.
 -  Okay.

395
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,310
- Yes.
 -  Hey!

396
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,640
Where did you take Dad?

397
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,470
I didn't take him.

398
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,670
When I got to the room, the chairman was already gone.

399
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,040
Do you expect me to believe that?

400
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,270
Who put you up to this?

401
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,280
Is it Gun Woo...

402
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,540
or Gi Tan?

403
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,570
Mr Kim. Talk to the hospital...

404
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,670
and make sure this news doesn't leak out.

405
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,740
Yes, Sir.

406
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,940
If you're trying to play tricks,

407
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,510
I'll kill you with my own hands.

408
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,040
I'll put my life on the line if you want me to.

409
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,210
Please trust me.

410
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,740
What a jerk.

411
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,910
That hurts.

412
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,940
Anyhow, this is getting complicated.

413
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,240
Pause it, please.

414
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,810
That's Father.

415
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,970
They covered him up, but I can tell.

416
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,770
Do you know that person?

417
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,810
I'm not sure.

418
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,670
He has a mask on, so it's hard to tell.

419
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,710
Please found out and let us know.

420
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,170
All right.

421
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,870
- Gun Woo.
 -  Gi Tan.

422
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,750
Go ahead.

423
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,940
Did you take my father?

424
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,040
I think it has got to be someone around us.

425
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,670
I'm just curious.

426
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,510
I thought it would be you.

427
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,040
The only person...

428
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,670
who would benefit from this would be you.

429
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,640
There's the inheritance issue as well.

430
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,370
You should butt out of our family affairs.

431
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,540
I wish I could, but it's just so entertaining to watch you.

432
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,110
Entertaining? What did I do?

433
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,610
Do you want me to tell you?

434
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,810
Are you sure you want to hear it with Soo Yeon here?

435
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,210
No matter what you say, she won't believe you.

436
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,940
You know Yang Dong Yi, right?

437
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,670
You're...

438
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,110
a terrible human.

439
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,710
You're just as bad as Il Jae.

440
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,440
Gun Woo, do you know Dong Yi?

441
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,610
- Yes, I know him.
 -  How?

442
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,910
He approached me as if he were a businessman,

443
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,170
but I only found out he's working for Gwang Woo later.

444
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,270
There's a lot I need to resolve.

445
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,340
I'll get going.

446
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,870
Your father's dead.

447
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,240
He didn't die. He disappeared.

448
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,570
There's no way he would have walked out on his two feet.

449
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,870
The surgery must have gone wrong and Gun Woo probably took him...

450
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,640
in order to hide the fact that he died.

451
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,110
Come to think of it, that sounds likely.

452
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,340
Why would Gun Woo hide him?

453
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,480
Because if the world finds out my husband is dead,

454
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,910
the inheritance will be divided according to the will.

455
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,980
That's no reason to hide a corpse.

456
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,210
It's his father after all.

457
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,570
You don't know anything.

458
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,410
Gwang Woo, pack up right away.

459
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,640
Are you going back home?

460
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,240
It's my house. Of course, I should.

461
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,810
I'm the owner now.

462
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,970
What are you doing? Pack up.

463
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,010
All right, Mum.

464
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,210
I need to be on my toes.

465
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,910
That's the only way I'll be able to take everything.

466
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,040
Let's call the police first.

467
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,110
We can't.

468
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,970
Why not?

469
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,240
If word gets out,

470
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,440
Dodo Group's shares will plummet.

471
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,050
Is that all you care about?

472
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,170
He asked me to take over the company.

473
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,170
You heard him.

474
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,770
What do you want to do?

475
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,390
Where is your father?

476
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,510
What do you mean?

477
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,510
As if tearing our family apart wasn't enough,

478
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,770
now you smuggled your father's body.

479
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,110
You're very brazen. It's your fault he's dead.

480
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,440
Shut your mouth.

481
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,210
I will plan his funeral.

482
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,910
Mum.

483
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,140
A funeral without a body?

484
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,420
Are you afraid you'll have nothing once his will is read?

485
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,070
Bring his body back then.

486
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,040
No one in this family is on your side now.

487
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,970
I'm against having the funeral, too.

488
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,000
That's just wrong.

489
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,670
Get a grip, you fool.

490
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,640
We have to get on with our lives.

491
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,620
Do you have the right to say that?

492
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,040
Shin Young.

493
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,740
Step aside.

494
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,970
I put up with you for Dad's sake,

495
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,010
but that's over now.

496
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,080
Won't news of the chairman's death...

497
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,210
work in your favour?

498
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,490
If his will is found in the secret safe...

499
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,940
Watch your tongue.

500
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,570
I'm sorry, Sir.

501
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,780
Let them do what they want for now.

502
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,670
If I am to avoid suspicion, the fake will...

503
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,640
must be found at the very end.

504
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,610
You're right.

505
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,500
Who do you think...

506
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,040
took the chairman from the hospital?

507
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,770
That bothers me.

508
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,770
Who could it be?

509
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,870
Thanks for making the time to come.

510
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,040
I heard his body is missing.

511
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,840
Will it be okay?

512
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,640
Nothing bad can happen.

513
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,220
He was pronounced dead.

514
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,010
I've never attended a funeral like this before.

515
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,370
Be quiet.

516
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,140
People might hear you.

517
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,670
What are you looking at?

518
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,440
I'm wondering if...

519
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,140
anyone here could've smuggled the chairman out.

520
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,170
Il Jae is here.

521
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,770
I'll wait for you outside.

522
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,740
Your approval rating has gone up.

523
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:51,010
I'm meeting members of the ruling party for dinner.

524
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,480
- I'll see you around.
 -  Goodbye.

525
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,810
Mr Byun.

526
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,570
I'm the elder son. Don't bow to him.

527
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,880
You're nothing now that...

528
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,340
the chairman's gone.

529
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,140
This is a public place.

530
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,010
Please leave.

531
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,810
You will...

532
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,070
come back to me.

533
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,870
Very soon, Gun Woo.

534
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,740
I guess no one here...

535
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,610
welcomed you, Uncle.

536
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,710
Thanks to you,

537
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,080
I feel a bit lonely, but very much at ease.

538
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,110
Guess what?

539
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,010
Did you know that the coffin in that church...

540
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,670
is empty?

541
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
Is it?

542
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,370
That's news to me.

543
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,740
Be prepared.

544
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,880
Evidence of your crimes...

545
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,370
will come into my possession very soon.

546
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,110
No such thing...

547
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
even exists.

548
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,980
Don't waste your efforts.

549
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,440
Chairman Do...

550
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,370
is with me.

551
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,570
Once he wakes up,

552
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,980
the secret files you fear more than anything...

553
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,480
will be mine.

554
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,310
Don't get ahead of yourself.

555
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,510
No secret file can take me down.

556
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,040
What do you think?

557
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,710
I'm not sure.

558
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,640
I don't think he had anything to do with the chairman.

559
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,170
We got one thing out of him.

560
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,490
What, Sir?

561
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,240
The files we're looking for.

562
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,240
The chairman has them.

563
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,840
Then the Pandora's Box is...

564
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,040
It could be...

565
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,170
in the chairman's secret safe.

566
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,610
Hwang Jae Man, the ruling party's presidential candidate,

567
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,790
is gaining support.

568
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,980
In a telephone poll aimed at Hanguk Party's congressmen,

569
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,200
Mr Hwang's support rating is very close to that...

570
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,610
of Bang Hyung Joo's, who is currently in the lead.

571
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,790
Next up.

572
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,000
Dodo Group's Chairman Do Choong died in surgery...

573
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,370
and his funeral took place today at a cathedral in Seoul.

574
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,940
I am still...

575
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,740
alive and well.

576
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,740
How dare they hold a funeral?

577
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,480
Dodo Group hosted the funeral, but out of respect...

578
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,800
for the late Mr Do's wishes,

579
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,220
only close family and friends were invited.

580
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,210
It was a simple affair.

581
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,610
How dare they?

582
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,710
I can't move.

583
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,140
I can't speak.

584
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,980
Where's our legal counsel?

585
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,980
How dare they make us wait?

586
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,940
Sorry we're late.

587
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,620
Replacing you will be the first thing I do.

588
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,840
Read my father's will.

589
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,110
I will read the late Do Choong's final will and testament.

590
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,640
"I, Do Choong, will the following."

591
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,540
"50 percent of the shares I own..."

592
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,010
"will go to Do Gwang Woo."

593
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,110
"30 percent of the shares I own..."

594
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,210
"will go to Do Shin Young."

595
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,370
"The remaining 20 percent..."

596
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,370
"will go to Hwang Gwi Ja."

597
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,450
"How the remaining assets are split up..."

598
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,010
"is up to the family,"

599
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,990
"but Gwang Woo takes 50 percent, Shin Young takes 30..."

600
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,670
"and Gwi Ja takes 20 percent."

601
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,980
That's it.

602
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,670
You heard it all.

603
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,140
Lawyer Oh, execute the will.

604
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,710
- Mr Han.
 -  Yes, Sir.

605
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,350
We'll host an extraordinary general meeting in two days.

606
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,100
What's the agenda?

607
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,980
Come on. Isn't it obvious?

608
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,770
We need to elect a temporary chairperson...

609
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,640
and fire Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo.

610
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,570
Yes, Sir.

611
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,410
(Chairman Do Choong)

612
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,040
Take this and throw it away in a garbage can.

613
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,070
Yes, Ma'am.

614
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,170
Gwang Woo, sit in the chairman's chair.

615
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,490
I'm fine. You should sit there.

616
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,140
You'll soon be the chairman. You should sit there.

617
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,940
I am going to make you the chairwoman...

618
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,330
in this next EGM.

619
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,500
Why?

620
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,570
I want you to be the temporary chairwoman.

621
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,110
I thought I should become...

622
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,240
the actual chairman at the next general meeting.

623
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,040
All right.

624
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,570
I guess that's another way to do it.

625
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,940
It's been so long.

626
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,070
After the EGM,

627
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,010
you should fire Mr Gong first.

628
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,510
We can't fire him yet.

629
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,570
Why not?

630
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,810
He knows all of the secrets about our household.

631
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,070
What if he decides to write an autobiography?

632
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,040
Not only will we be disgraced, but you'll be put in danger.

633
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,340
Oh, right.

634
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,240
Anyway, after this EGM,

635
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,200
I'm going to fire everyone...

636
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,310
from Gun Woo to the board.

637
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,410
I'll probably get fired after this EGM.

638
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,340
- Gun Woo.
 -  I'm fine with everything.

639
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,740
But I feel sorry to you.

640
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,640
I didn't get engaged to you to show you a bad side of me.

641
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,770
I don't care what your position is.

642
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,770
All I care about is that you are an honest person.

643
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,110
I hope you won't get hurt as you go through this, Gun Woo.

644
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,670
Thank you, Soo Yeon.

645
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,340
Lawyer Oh!

646
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,470
I was so busy that I forgot to tell you.

647
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,910
Choong Dong gets discharged from jail thanks to a special pardon.

648
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,440
What time is that?

649
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,570
I think we'll make it if we leave now.

650
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,210
I have to run.

651
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,440
I'll call you.

652
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,970
I'm sorry.

653
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,270
Gwang Woo, Gwi Ja.

654
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,140
Are you trying to get rid of me?

655
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,510
(Korea Prison)

656
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,540
Mr Oh.

657
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,270
Congratulations on your parole.

658
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,170
This will probably be the most delicious thing...

659
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,640
Lawyer Oh has ever brought.

660
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,710
Here. Eat up.

661
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,040
You should think about your mum.

662
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,370
Don't ever return to prison ever again.

663
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,210
Come on.

664
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,510
Why did he throw this away? This is perfectly good.

665
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,710
I'm sorry, I'm late.

666
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,870
Thanks for your work, Choong Dong.

667
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,640
I heard you took good care of my dear Choong Dong.

668
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,540
Thank you, Lawyer Oh.

669
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,610
You can forget about him now.

670
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,110
He'll continue to work for me.

671
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,960
Let's go, Choong Dong.

672
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,970
- I'll drive.
 -  No, I'll drive. Get in.

673
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,040
He's on Il Jae's side to the end.

674
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,840
Everything we did went down the drain.

675
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,740
It's too early to give up.

676
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,040
You saw him, too.

677
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,370
Once Il Jae called him,

678
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,540
he ran over wagging his tail.

679
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,870
Choong Dong has been shaken.

680
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,640
I will make sure he gives in.

681
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,960
I got divorced and abandoned by Jae Man.

682
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,640
People give me such sad looks.

683
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,370
You still look fatigued.

684
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,770
For someone in the second place, first place is their enemy.

685
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,010
For third place, first and second places are their enemies.

686
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,570
Having fell through means I have a lot of people...

687
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,070
to get rid of.

688
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,810
Other than that, everything is the same.

689
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,940
It doesn't matter which place I'm in.

690
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,640
I only aim to come first place.

691
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:51,700
You'll be busy because we have so many enemies.

692
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,840
Be ready for it.

693
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,310
Yes.

694
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:58,010
Anyway, where are we headed?

695
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,610
You're here.

696
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,870
This is an anaesthetist of Dodo Hospital who's helping me.

697
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,710
Didn't you used to work at Sudo Hospital?

698
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,970
You're right. That's when he was a director there.

699
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,170
I'm surprised you remember me.

700
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,510
I thought the news reported Chairman Do dead.

701
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,410
If it wasn't for Doctor Kim, I would've never gotten him here.

702
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,040
Patient Do Choong has legally passed away as of 9:28am.

703
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,970
The guy who brought him out is...

704
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,670
Doctor Kim's younger brother.

705
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:45,840
If things go well, she'll become the director of Dodo Hospital.

706
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,710
I look forward to it, Lawyer Byun.

707
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,270
How is he doing?

708
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,110
He can't talk at all.

709
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:55,940
He also can't move well due to paralysis.

710
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,070
Can he hear?

711
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,140
His hearing is normal.

712
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,310
Chairman Do.

713
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,110
You've lived your life in vain.

714
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,560
Other than Shin Young,

715
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,510
there was no one who was sad about your death.

716
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,740
Do you know why you're here?

717
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,240
It's because you trusted Gun Woo.

718
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,110
He's a dangerous man.

719
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,740
You'll soon learn about Gun Woo for who he really is.

720
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,340
Great work, Son.

721
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,810
I'm sorry that I put you through this, Mum.

722
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,940
We don't even know where Dad is or what happened to him.

723
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,470
How can you do this?

724
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,840
Why do you wonder where he is?

725
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,570
He's probably dating Ja Young, Gun Woo's mum, in his afterlife.

726
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,140
Lawyer Oh is here.

727
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,910
What happened to his assets and inheritance?

728
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,440
It's being processed.

729
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,570
Process it quickly and run to Bando Bank tomorrow.

730
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,930
Bando Bank? Why?

731
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,910
We have to empty out the secret safe if we want to clear his articles.

732
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,040
A lawyer needs to be there,

733
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,340
so you can go over with Shin Young.

734
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,080
Why would I go there?

735
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,070
One of the heirs need to be there.

736
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,800
Why is that me?

737
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,710
Tomorrow is the EGM.

738
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,040
He'll be busy from the morning.

739
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,370
I'll write you a warrant, so go.

740
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,310
Tomorrow, Gun Woo will become penniless.

741
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,710
Soo Yeon.

742
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,370
What did I tell you?

743
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,740
I said I'd make you regret choosing Gun Woo.

744
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,210
At today's EGM,

745
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,610
Ms Hwang will be named temporary chairwoman.

746
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,310
Whoever it is,

747
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:12,070
it will be easier to deal with than Gun Woo.

748
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,190
Dodo Hotel will become the new holding company.

749
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,670
If I threaten them with the bonds,

750
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,570
they won't be able to refuse.

751
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,970
(Do Shin Young)

752
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,840
Isn't it a bit early?

753
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:33,970
I have to go to Bando Bank and I don't want to.

754
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,110
Bando Bank? What for?

755
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,840
We have to clear out his secret safe.

756
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:42,670
His secret safe?

757
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,670
Could you take Shin Young to Bando Bank?

758
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,360
Yes, Sir.

759
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,350
Why should he come along?

760
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,170
We need to check something.

761
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,210
Hello.

762
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,270
Do you have the documents?

763
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,840
- Here it is.
 -  Thanks.

764
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,720
(Power of Attorney)

765
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,440
That's fine. Come with me.

766
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,440
Why are you here?

767
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,170
The Pandora's Box we're looking for...

768
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,640
may be in here.

769
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,230
If it is,

770
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,580
we'll ask Shin Young if we can take it.

771
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,310
Remember that.

772
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,240
Okay.

773
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,570
This is it. Please check.

774
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,610
What's this?

775
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,240
Is this the only thing inside?

776
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,550
What's this?

777
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,570
What's wrong?

778
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,920
It's a will in the chairman's hand.

779
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,240
What?

780
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,010
There's another will?

781
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,920
This is dated most recently.

782
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,240
That means...

783
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,940
this is legally binding.

784
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,910
What does it say?

785
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,740
Lawyer Oh's party just left the bank.

786
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,640
They'll have found and read the will by now.

787
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:04,640
Gun Woo.

788
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,310
Are you here to resign?

789
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:15,590
I'd have tendered my resignation if I were you.

790
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:19,840
Do you want to get embarrassed in front of all our shareholders?

791
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,070
Where's your pride?

792
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,910
Say hello next time.

793
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,540
You look so calm.

794
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,240
Aren't you nervous?

795
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,040
Should I be?

796
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,170
We all know how this meeting will end.

797
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,310
I don't think we can be sure of anything.

798
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,440
I think he knows about...

799
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,240
the handwritten will.

800
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,710
He got into the safe already.

801
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:58,070
I smell...

802
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,470
something very fishy.

803
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,320
With your overwhelming support,

804
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,740
we now have a temporary chairperson.

805
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,820
I shall now let Chairwoman Hwang Gwi Ja take the stand...

806
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,560
and make a speech.

807
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,840
Mr Han.

808
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,970
I'll speak at the end. Deal with the next agenda first.

809
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,010
Yes, Ma'am.

810
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,440
We shall now vote on whether Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo...

811
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,570
must be dismissed.

812
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,970
Wait!

813
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,670
We found...

814
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,640
in Chairman Do's safety deposit box...

815
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,440
a handwritten will.

816
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,110
There's another will?

817
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,110
What's he talking about?

818
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,570
The date here is May 7 of this year.

819
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,310
It was written before the chairman was diagnosed with dementia.

820
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,370
That makes this a legally binding will...

821
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,060
that supersedes any other will the chairman...

822
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,640
wrote before this.

823
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,670
What?

824
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,610
Is that true?

825
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,340
As Dodo Group's legal counsel,

826
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,710
Lawyer Oh will read it out.

827
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,640
I shall now read Chairman Do Choong's will.

828
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,070
"This is my will."

829
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:45,140
"My wife and eldest son tried to harm me."

830
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:48,170
"They will not inherit anything."

831
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:54,450
"My daughter treated me with disrespect."

832
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:56,870
"I will leave her the house in Samseong-dong."

833
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,450
"My shares and assets..."

834
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,270
"will go to Yoon Ja Young's son."

835
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:06,040
"But Yoon Ja Young's son..."

836
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:10,040
"must uphold my spirit and make the company flourish."

837
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,240
That is all.

838
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,440
Who is Yoon Ja Young's son?

839
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,440
It's Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo.

840
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:19,410
Is that true?

841
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:23,410
Was that...

842
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,610
really found in your father's safe?

843
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:30,950
Yes.

844
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,240
Gun Woo.

845
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:35,510
Are you behind this?

846
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:36,910
Behind what?

847
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,710
Dad never said that he'd left...

848
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,740
a handwritten will.

849
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,270
I'd never heard of it either.

850
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:50,010
How dare you try to dupe me?

851
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,370
Come here.

852
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:54,150
You planned this!

853
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,550
I did not!

854
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:56,710
I've never seen it before!

855
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,210
I don't believe you!

856
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,470
Gwang Woo. Are you okay?

857
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,310
Leave my son alone.

858
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,770
- Ma'am.
 -  Are you mad?

859
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:10,110
Calm down.

860
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,840
- Don't forget where you are!
 -  Ma'am.

861
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,370
- Calm down.
 -  Let me go.

862
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:15,740
You did it!

863
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,170
Calm down, Sir.

864
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,050
Calm down.

865
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,840
First your mother, now you!

866
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,950
I'd never heard about this will!

867
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,340
Don't do this in public!

868
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,770
Gwang Woo might be right.

869
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,440
The will could be fake.

870
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,170
Dodo Group's extraordinary general meeting...

871
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,640
ended in utter chaos.

872
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:48,320
Do Choong's handwritten will was revealed and read out,

873
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,010
and Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo was named temporary chairman.

874
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,070
Ex-CEO Do Gwang Woo insists on contesting the will...

875
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,610
and vowed he would sue.

876
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,110
(Byun Il Jae)

877
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:17,840
I sent the photos.

878
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,070
(Byun Il Jae)

879
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:37,970
Lawyer Oh.

880
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,610
Where is Gun Woo?

881
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,140
In the chairman's office.

882
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,210
This is his phone. I picked it up earlier.

883
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,570
I'll take it to him.

884
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,840
You will sue for your share?

885
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,500
Did you think we'd just let you take it all?

886
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,470
You hid your father away so you could pull this off!

887
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:05,910
Sue me.

888
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:09,320
I will put you behind bars for attempted murder.

889
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,840
Attempted murder?

890
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,110
Have you forgotten?

891
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:14,240
You swapped my father's medication.

892
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,470
I have video evidence!

893
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:21,610
Sir.

894
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:26,040
Here's your phone.

895
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,210
Where did you find it?

896
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,140
(Byun Il Jae)

897
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,110
What is it?

898
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:40,050
Did you get the photo I sent?

899
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:41,140
What photo?

900
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:45,340
I'll send it again. Give me a call.

901
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,670
What is it?

902
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,610
My father.

903
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,040
Il Jae has him.

904
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,310
You know Yang Don Yi, right?

905
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:10,140
You're...

906
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,510
a terrible human.

907
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,210
Just as bad as Il Jae.

908
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,710
Chairman Do Gun Woo's here.

909
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,710
Come in.

910
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,710
Sit down.

911
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,970
Congratulations on becoming the chairman.

912
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,410
Tell me what happened.

913
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,670
It's me, Choong Dong.

914
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:45,440
Come in.

915
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,410
I can't let Gun Woo...

916
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:01,110
deceive you any longer.

917
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,730
(Monster)

918
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:35,440
Gun Woo's actions don't make sense.

919
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,670
Shin Young fell into the trap I set.

920
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:39,870
I beg of you.

921
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,370
Don't ever show up again.

922
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:43,240
I need to meet him.

923
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:44,840
Find a way.

924
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,110
I'm not stupid.

925
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,810
Of course I should get rid of everyone at once.

926
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,440
I will become President.

927
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,210
No one can stop me.

928
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,510
The stage is set. It's time to act.
