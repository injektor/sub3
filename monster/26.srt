<font color="yellow">Do you want me to drop your murder charges...</font>

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,600
<font color="yellow">and give you some share of the blueprint?</font>

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,530
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I have a condition, too.</font>

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,540
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,640
<font color="yellow">Why don't you come work for me?</font>

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me...</font>

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,680
<font color="yellow">to become a member of Huaping?</font>

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,170
<font color="yellow">Not just a member.</font>

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,440
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you to be my right-hand man.</font>

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,740
<font color="yellow">You'll be the second-in-command.</font>

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,100
<font color="yellow">That was...</font>

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
<font color="yellow">not part of my plan.</font>

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,140
<font color="yellow">It wasn't in mine either.</font>

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,240
<font color="yellow">I would never make this offer to anyone else from now on.</font>

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,000
<font color="yellow">Answer me, Gi Tan.</font>

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,700
<font color="yellow">Will you take my offer?</font>

18
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,170
<font color="yellow">- Gi Tan!
- Gi Tan!</font>

19

- Hurry up.</font>

21
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,100
<font color="yellow">- Don't shoot.
- Move.</font>

22
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,270
<font color="yellow">Don't shoot. You shot Gi Tan.</font>

23
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,270
<font color="yellow">Move away!</font>

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,040
<font color="yellow">Where did it come from?</font>

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
<font color="yellow">Across the river, Boss.</font>

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,370
<font color="yellow">Start the car.</font>

28
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,600
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Gi Tan.</font>

29
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,170
<font color="yellow">Get him in the car.</font>

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,040
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Cha Woo. We failed.</font>

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
<font color="yellow">No, it's not over yet.</font>

32
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,570
<font color="yellow">- What is that?
- I installed a bomb...</font>

33
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,000
<font color="yellow">just in case we fail.</font>

34
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,500
<font color="yellow">Our plan will end perfectly...</font>

35
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,640
<font color="yellow">if those four people die.</font>

36
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,270
<font color="yellow">No, Cha Woo.</font>

37
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,700
<font color="yellow">Don't press it.</font>

38
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,530
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you sad to see Gi Tan die?</font>

39
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,770
<font color="yellow">Don't do it!</font>

40
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,940
<font color="yellow">Watch me.</font>

41
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,270
<font color="yellow">This bomb will be the firework that blesses...</font>

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,700
<font color="yellow">our brand new beginning.</font>

43
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,940
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

44
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,170
<font color="yellow">Don't get in the way.</font>

45
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,940
<font color="yellow">This is for the both of us.</font>

46
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,170
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, what?</font>

48
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,330
<font color="yellow">Please get out. There's a bomb in there.</font>

49
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,340
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
<font color="yellow">Cha Woo has...</font>

51
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,870
<font color="yellow">Drop it.</font>

52
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,470
<font color="yellow">You started this.</font>

53
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,870
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to back out...</font>

54
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,950
<font color="yellow">because of Gi Tan?</font>

55
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,370
<font color="yellow">Drop it, Cha Woo.</font>

56
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,670
<font color="yellow">Shoot me if you can.</font>

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,940
<font color="yellow">I know that you can't.</font>

58
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,070
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

59
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
<font color="yellow">Our lives will change...</font>

60
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,510
<font color="yellow">with this button.</font>

61
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,470
<font color="yellow">I killed...</font>

62
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,240
<font color="yellow">Cha Woo.</font>

63
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,570
<font color="yellow">Cha Woo...</font>

64
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,840
<font color="yellow">It's me, Mr Jang.</font>

65
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,400
<font color="yellow">There's someone you need to save right now.</font>

66
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,300
<font color="yellow">It's a gunshot wound, so he can't go to the hospital.</font>

67
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,370
<font color="yellow">There's an operating room near Cheongpyeong. Meet us there now.</font>

68
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,700
<font color="yellow">- Leo.
- Yes, Boss.</font>

69
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,040
<font color="yellow">Call the boys to clean up the area.</font>

70
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,040
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan and Sung Ae...</font>

71
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,240
<font color="yellow">both died today from the explosion.</font>

72
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
<font color="yellow">Hyeong Gu and Il Jae are on the same side.</font>

73
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,900
<font color="yellow">So if we want to fake our deaths,</font>

74
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,600
<font color="yellow">we have to fool Hyeong Gu first.</font>

75
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,630
<font color="yellow">I'll get rid of him.</font>

76
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,370
<font color="yellow">He's an executive of the NIS.</font>

77
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,440
<font color="yellow">We don't want to get in trouble. Leak fake rumours instead.</font>

78
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

79
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,640
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan!</font>

80
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,070
<font color="yellow">Wake up!</font>

81
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,600
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, wake up!</font>

82
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,000
<font color="yellow">- Gi Tan. Wake up...
- Wake up!</font>

83
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,770
<font color="yellow">Please. You can't die.</font>

84
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,940
<font color="yellow">You promised you'd come back.</font>

85
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,940
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun. Jeong Eun.</font>

86
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,970
<font color="yellow">Please, Guk Cheol.</font>

87
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,770
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan. Gi Tan.</font>

88
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,840
<font color="yellow">Don't go. Don't.</font>

89
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Soo Yeon. I have to go.</font>

90
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,670
<font color="yellow">You can't. Don't go!</font>

91
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,300
<font color="yellow">Don't go, Gi Tan. Please don't leave me...</font>

92
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,370
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

93
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,340
<font color="yellow">Don't go, Gi Tan.</font>

94
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,840
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

95
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,900
<font color="yellow">Is everything all right?</font>

96
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,940
<font color="yellow">- Cha Woo betrayed me?
- Yes.</font>

97
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,400
<font color="yellow">I saw him take a sniper rifle, so I tailed him.</font>

98
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,770
<font color="yellow">Why did he betray me?</font>

99
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,540
<font color="yellow">I think he was eyeing the blueprint Gi Tan has.</font>

100
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
<font color="yellow">Where's Gi Tan?</font>

101
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,390
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

102
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,170
<font color="yellow">I did all I could with the emergency treatment,</font>

103
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,300
<font color="yellow">but I'm concerned about the bullet in his head.</font>

104
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,610
<font color="yellow">What will happen to him?</font>

105
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,000
<font color="yellow">It's a miracle he's still alive.</font>

106
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,270
<font color="yellow">It's stuck in a difficult area. If we end up making a mistake...</font>

107
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,440
<font color="yellow">- during surgery...
- So?</font>

108
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,900
<font color="yellow">What will happen to him.</font>

109
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,340
<font color="yellow">It's hard to say that...</font>

110
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,900
<font color="yellow">he'll make it out alive at this stage.</font>

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,740
<font color="yellow">He took the hit for me.</font>

112
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,970
<font color="yellow">His life is the same as mine.</font>

113
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,170
<font color="yellow">You have to save him no matter what. No matter what!</font>

114
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,340
<font color="yellow">I did my best. Let's wait and see.</font>

115
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,840
<font color="yellow">You love kimchijjigae.</font>

116
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,110
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

117
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,840
<font color="yellow">You should eat more.</font>

118
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,270
<font color="yellow">It'll give you more energy.</font>

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

120
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,290
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, near Yangju Bridge,</font>

121
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,720
<font color="yellow">a car exploded and fell into the river.</font>

122
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,240
<font color="yellow">The police are investigating nearby security cameras and witnesses,</font>

123
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,000
<font color="yellow">and they believe that the people inside the car were...</font>

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,570
<font color="yellow">the escaped prisoner Kang and his accomplice Yoo.</font>

125
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,670
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that Gi Tan?
- In the damaged car,</font>

126
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,570
<font color="yellow">police found their personal belongings.</font>

127
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,200
<font color="yellow">The police are assuming that it was a suicide...</font>

128
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,110
<font color="yellow">and have started a search to find the bodies.</font>

129
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,450
<font color="yellow">Are you sure Gi Tan's dead?</font>

130
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm sure.</font>

131
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,340
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't believe anything until they find his body.</font>

132
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,140
<font color="yellow">Huaping is good at cleaning up after themselves.</font>

133
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,240
<font color="yellow">It'll be impossible to find their bodies.</font>

134
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,400
<font color="yellow">Coma? Gi Tan is in a coma?</font>

135
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,110
<font color="yellow">His brain is alive,</font>

136
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,200
<font color="yellow">but he's unconscious.</font>

137
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,580
<font color="yellow">When will he wake up?</font>

138
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,270
<font color="yellow">It could be a month or a year.</font>

139
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,740
<font color="yellow">He may never wake up at all.</font>

140
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,240
<font color="yellow">I'll call you back later.</font>

141
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,470
<font color="yellow">Did Gi Tan really die?</font>

142
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,940
<font color="yellow">I saw the corpse myself.</font>

143
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,840
<font color="yellow">I have to see it myself to believe it.</font>

144
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,500
<font color="yellow">If you want everyone to know that you're behind this, go ahead.</font>

145
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,870
<font color="yellow">I'll call back.</font>

146
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,170
<font color="yellow">I won't be having nightmares about Guk Cheol any more.</font>

147
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Gi Tan.</font>

148
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,940
<font color="yellow">My greed...</font>

149
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,840
<font color="yellow">did this to you.</font>

150
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,200
<font color="yellow">Forgive me.</font>

151
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,940
<font color="yellow">She's up to something for sure.</font>

152
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,700
<font color="yellow">Is Soo Yeon still looking for Gi Tan?</font>

153
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,540
<font color="yellow">Please look out for him.</font>

154
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,640
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

155
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,240
<font color="yellow">She's going around police stations and hospitals.</font>

156
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,620
<font color="yellow">Why hospitals?</font>

157
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,790
<font color="yellow">She's trying to see if any of the unidentified patients...</font>

158
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,540
<font color="yellow">might be him.</font>

159
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,100
<font color="yellow">(Hangang Hospital)</font>

160
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,640
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so shabby? Did you even eat?</font>

161
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,070
<font color="yellow">I told you to leave me alone.</font>

162
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,470
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to be like this?</font>

163
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,140
<font color="yellow">I don't have the energy to talk to you.</font>

164
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,670
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan is dead!</font>

165
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,040
<font color="yellow">He's not dead.</font>

166
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,100
<font color="yellow">Wake up, Soo Yeon!</font>

167
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,200
<font color="yellow">Let me go. Let me go!</font>

168
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,160
<font color="yellow">A dead man won't come back even if you do this.</font>

169
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,600
<font color="yellow">He's alive.</font>

170
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,270
<font color="yellow">He's alive. I'm sure of it. He has to be alive!</font>

171
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,000
<font color="yellow">Just accept it.</font>

172
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,770
<font color="yellow">You already know that he's dead.</font>

173
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,370
<font color="yellow">Find out what Gwang Woo is up to these days.</font>

174
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,570
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

175
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

176
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,370
<font color="yellow">Are you looking down at me because I'm a regular worker?</font>

177
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,440
<font color="yellow">- No, Sir!
- No, Sir!</font>

178
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,870
<font color="yellow">Chief Oh, stand up.</font>

179
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,400
<font color="yellow">Chief Oh.</font>

180
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

181
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,540
<font color="yellow">I'm a joke?</font>

182
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,570
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

183
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,370
<font color="yellow">Then why are you telling me to work?</font>

184
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,640
<font color="yellow">How dare you order me around?</font>

185
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

186
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,300
<font color="yellow">Head down.</font>

187
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey! Raise your hands up higher!</font>

188
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,270
<font color="yellow">How's Gwang Woo doing?</font>

189
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,260
<font color="yellow">Nothing has changed.</font>

190
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,300
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

191
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,070
<font color="yellow">make him into a worthy man?</font>

192
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,280
<font color="yellow">How could I do something even you couldn't do?</font>

193
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,740
<font color="yellow">Could you do it...</font>

194
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,540
<font color="yellow">if I gave you all of my authorities?</font>

195
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,470
<font color="yellow">Authorities?</font>

196
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,640
<font color="yellow">All authorities to him...</font>

197
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,640
<font color="yellow">as his father and Chairman.</font>

198
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,100
<font color="yellow">Even kings can't change their children.</font>

199
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,900
<font color="yellow">If you give up on him,</font>

200
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,140
<font color="yellow">I'll have to give up on him, too.</font>

201
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,900
<font color="yellow">I hope you can...</font>

202
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,740
<font color="yellow">accept this offer...</font>

203
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,640
<font color="yellow">for his sake.</font>

204
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,500
<font color="yellow">Please make sure...</font>

205
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,110
<font color="yellow">nothing will happen to me, Chairman.</font>

206
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,370
<font color="yellow">Nothing will happen to you even if that means...</font>

207
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,640
<font color="yellow">I have to let Gwang Woo go.</font>

208
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
<font color="yellow">I understand,</font>

209
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,600
<font color="yellow">Chairman.</font>

210
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

211
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,840
<font color="yellow">Did Father say anything about me?</font>

212
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,670
<font color="yellow">Did he say anything about how long I have to be at the storage?</font>

213
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,700
<font color="yellow">Follow me if you want to know.</font>

214
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,740
<font color="yellow">What? Make me into a man?</font>

215
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,330
<font color="yellow">He asked you to make me into a man, right?</font>

216
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,370
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

217
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,170
<font color="yellow">What if I am made into a man?</font>

218
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,430
<font color="yellow">I'll get complimented...</font>

219
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,840
<font color="yellow">and you'll be appointed into an important position.</font>

220
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,900
<font color="yellow">This sounds great. You and I can come up with a story.</font>

221
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,210
<font color="yellow">Go and tell him that I have become a new man.</font>

222
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,270
<font color="yellow">I'll behave when I'm around him.</font>

223
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,470
<font color="yellow">I respect Chairman's will.</font>

224
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,770
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm asking you to put on a show with me.</font>

225
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,270
<font color="yellow">I really am going to make you into a new man.</font>

226
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,940
<font color="yellow">- What?
- First, clean up this storage.</font>

227
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,400
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see a speck of dust on my hand.</font>

228
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,840
<font color="yellow">Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

229
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,340
<font color="yellow">Next, fill out the supplies management book.</font>

230
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,370
<font color="yellow">If anything is missing, you'll do it again.</font>

231
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,270
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're somebody because Dad's behind you?</font>

232
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,990
<font color="yellow">I'll give you three hours. Begin.</font>

233
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,200
<font color="yellow">You're crazy. You've gone insane.</font>

234
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
<font color="yellow">Begin.</font>

235
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,400
<font color="yellow">Aren't you afraid of my backlash?</font>

236
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,670
<font color="yellow">Just do it, you idiot!</font>

237
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,940
<font color="yellow">- "Idiot"?
- Chief!</font>

238
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

239
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,600
<font color="yellow">Lock the door from the outside.</font>

240
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,130
<font color="yellow">- What?
- It's Chairman's orders.</font>

241
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,200
<font color="yellow">Lock the door and open it only on my words.</font>

242
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

243
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,840
<font color="yellow">We're not leaving until this place is clean.</font>

244
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,100
<font color="yellow">Or we can starve to death.</font>

245
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,770
<font color="yellow">Did you decode everything?</font>

246
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,140
<font color="yellow">Yes. Vice Chairman is waiting for you.</font>

247
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

248
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,440
<font color="yellow">What about the company?</font>

249
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,870
<font color="yellow">It's already registered.</font>

250
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,750
<font color="yellow">We can register the vaccine under that company's name.</font>

251
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,400
<font color="yellow">When will you sign the contract with me?</font>

252
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,900
<font color="yellow">I heard your dismissal is...</font>

253
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,200
<font color="yellow">one of the topics for this general meeting.</font>

254
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,970
<font color="yellow">Why don't we sign it at that time?</font>

255
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,330
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

256
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,540
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

257
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,390
<font color="yellow">Your future is looking bright.</font>

258
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,970
<font color="yellow">You did a good job as well.</font>

259
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,100
<font color="yellow">I'll keep in touch.</font>

260
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,240
<font color="yellow">Your future isn't bright.</font>

261
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,870
<font color="yellow">It's your way to the rock bottom, Gun Woo.</font>

262
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,240
<font color="yellow">When will you contact Gwang Woo?</font>

263
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,500
<font color="yellow">Are you asleep?</font>

264
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping?</font>

265
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,640
<font color="yellow">I won't forget...</font>

266
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,670
<font color="yellow">this humiliation, Moon Tae Gwang.</font>

267
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
<font color="yellow">What humiliation?</font>

268
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,040
<font color="yellow">Are you finished?</font>

269
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,070
<font color="yellow">I'm finished. Open the door.</font>

270
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,870
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

271
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,670
<font color="yellow">Clean this shelf again.</font>

272
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,650
<font color="yellow">Mr Do, are you deaf?</font>

273
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,670
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

274
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,070
<font color="yellow">"Are you deaf?"</font>

275
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,000
<font color="yellow">What if I am?</font>

276
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
<font color="yellow">This one, too.</font>

277
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,870
<font color="yellow">Great job today.</font>

278
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,570
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

279
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,840
<font color="yellow">I will report everything you've done today to Chairman.</font>

280
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,280
<font color="yellow">- What?
- From now on,</font>

281
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,910
<font color="yellow">our work days will be like this.</font>

282
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,900
<font color="yellow">You should be prepared.</font>

283
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,490
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do?</font>

284
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,900
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to fix you...</font>

285
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,170

289
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,170

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,200
<font color="yellow">Are you busy?</font>

291
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,470
<font color="yellow">I just have to sign papers.</font>

292
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,140
<font color="yellow">I'm not so busy.</font>

293
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,900
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to you. Let's meet right now.</font>

294

<font color="yellow">Where are we meeting?</font>

295
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,470
<font color="yellow">Wow, look at this.</font>

296
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,870
<font color="yellow">This is the famous blueprint we've been looking for.</font>

297
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,200
<font color="yellow">Take a look at the contract.</font>

298
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,470
<font color="yellow">Contracts are always the same.</font>

299
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,840
<font color="yellow">You should take a look.</font>

300
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,200
<font color="yellow">If I can't trust my family, whom can I trust?</font>

301
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,940
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

302
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
<font color="yellow">Let's sign this...</font>

303
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,600
<font color="yellow">in front of the shareholders...</font>

304
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,940
<font color="yellow">at the extraordinary general meeting.</font>

305
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,300
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you?</font>

306
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,040
<font color="yellow">I told you that I'll find it.</font>

307

308
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,930
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Then you can take it back.</font>

309
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,240
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

310
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,270
<font color="yellow">You can't.</font>

<font color="yellow">Did you forget...</font>

313
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
<font color="yellow">that I have the upper hand?</font>

314
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,200
<font color="yellow">You have the upper hand, but you can't act like one...</font>

315
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,840
<font color="yellow">because of your father-in-law.</font>

316
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,040
<font color="yellow">You will see me...</font>

317
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,170
<font color="yellow">acting like one very soon.</font>

318
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
<font color="yellow">Get the papers.</font>

319
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,640
<font color="yellow">Just go.</font>

320
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,270
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Sir.</font>

321
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,270
<font color="yellow">I finally got it. Everything's over.</font>

322
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,500
<font color="yellow">Mum, it's me.</font>

323
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,940
<font color="yellow">Everything is taken care of.</font>

324
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,900
<font color="yellow">Yes, I look forward to the extraordinary general meeting.</font>

325
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,200
<font color="yellow">Keep your mouth shut until then.</font>

326
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,870
<font color="yellow">It looks like Il Jae can't go against you.</font>

327
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,540
<font color="yellow">It's not that he can't.</font>

328
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,240
<font color="yellow">He won't because he loves him.</font>

329
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,970
<font color="yellow">Let me announce...</font>

330
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,600
<font color="yellow">the power of attorney at the EGM.</font>

331
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,000
<font color="yellow">Do you want to give Gun Woo the blow?</font>

332
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,940
<font color="yellow">I wanted to do it.</font>

333
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,270
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Uncle?</font>

334
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,400
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do?</font>

335
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,340
<font color="yellow">Fine then.</font>

336
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,470
<font color="yellow">Feel free to go ahead and give him a taste.</font>

337
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,370
<font color="yellow">It's not a bad idea to begin...</font>

338
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,700
<font color="yellow">my political career again at Dodo Group's EGM.</font>

339
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,170
<font color="yellow">Send this...</font>

340
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,940
<font color="yellow">to China to decode it.</font>

341
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,570
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

342
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Il Jae's side has it decoded already.</font>

343
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,600
<font color="yellow">The new vaccine won't be able to enter China.</font>

344
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,540
<font color="yellow">All we need is control over the mainland.</font>

345
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,840
<font color="yellow">What will you do with Gi Tan?</font>

346
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,340
<font color="yellow">- Leo.
- Yes, Boss.</font>

347
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,900
<font color="yellow">Look for the right time...</font>

348
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,800
<font color="yellow">to turn Cha Woo into...</font>

349
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,900
<font color="yellow">the murderer of Professor Na.</font>

350
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,440
<font color="yellow">He might never wake up.</font>

351
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,900
<font color="yellow">I'll take him to mainland with me.</font>

352
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,870
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you'll move him to China?</font>

353
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,900
<font color="yellow">His brain is still alive.</font>

354
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,240
<font color="yellow">I'll get all the help I can there...</font>

355
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,200
<font color="yellow">to make him wake up again.</font>

356
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,370
<font color="yellow">Look into a boat to get us out.</font>

357
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,270
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.</font>

358
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,300
<font color="yellow">What do you...</font>

359
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,240
<font color="yellow">plan on doing?</font>

360
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,740
<font color="yellow">I need more time to think.</font>

361
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,500
<font color="yellow">What a beautiful house.</font>

362
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,200
<font color="yellow">Whose house is it anyway?</font>

363
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,670
<font color="yellow">It's Cha Jeong Eun's house.</font>

364
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,070
<font color="yellow">And if you permit,</font>

365
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,940
<font color="yellow">it'd be our house.</font>

366
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,740
<font color="yellow">Guk Cheol...</font>

367
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
<font color="yellow">Will you...</font>

368
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,840
<font color="yellow">marry me?</font>

369
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,900
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

370
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,300
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo.</font>

371
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,740
<font color="yellow">The three of us can live happily together forever.</font>

372
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,540
<font color="yellow">Let's never leave each other's sides.</font>

373
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Guk Cheol.</font>

374
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,640
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo, you secured a deal for the new vaccine?</font>

375
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,270
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. Your father will hear you.</font>

376
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,170
<font color="yellow">He already left for work.</font>

377
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,600
<font color="yellow">I thought he wasn't well. He was really sick last night.</font>

378
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,740
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong took him himself.</font>

379
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,770
<font color="yellow">Why is he trying to protect his son outside of marriage?</font>

380
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,180
<font color="yellow">I can't bear to see him work.</font>

381
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,440
<font color="yellow">Don't get upset.</font>

382
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,970
<font color="yellow">Once we have the extraordinary general meeting today,</font>

383
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,840
<font color="yellow">everything will be cleared.</font>

384
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,340
<font color="yellow">But how did you manage to secure the deal?</font>

385
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,240
<font color="yellow">Don't be so rude. You'll ruin my day.</font>

386
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,540
<font color="yellow">If Gi Tan was here, he would've helped me...</font>

387
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,110
<font color="yellow">secure a deal.</font>

388
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking about the dead? Don't jinx us.</font>

389
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
<font color="yellow">Mum. Once I become the CEO,</font>

390
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,240
<font color="yellow">there's someone I want to fire right away.</font>

391
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,300
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

392
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,180
<font color="yellow">Moon Tae Gwang.</font>

393
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,940
<font color="yellow">Why him? Did he look down on you?</font>

394
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,240
<font color="yellow">I couldn't mention it because it was embarrassing, but...</font>

395
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
<font color="yellow">Just know that I'll fire him.</font>

396
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,370
<font color="yellow">It won't stop with him. Once your dad collapses...</font>

397
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,640
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

398
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,400
<font color="yellow">Why would Dad collapse?</font>

399
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,240
<font color="yellow">He's unwell these days. Eat your breakfast and go to work.</font>

400
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,640
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

401
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,100
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I feel dizzy, that's all.</font>

402
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
<font color="yellow">Do you want your pills?</font>

403
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,000
<font color="yellow">I already took my pills, it's okay.</font>

404
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,440
<font color="yellow">Hi. I'll try to stop the meeting today...</font>

405
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,100
<font color="yellow">about your Vice Chairman position.</font>

406
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,670
<font color="yellow">We'll sign the contract for the mutant virus vaccine at the EGM.</font>

407
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,000
<font color="yellow">Is the vaccine...</font>

408
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,770
<font color="yellow">ready?</font>

409
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,200
<font color="yellow">A new company named B World registered for the patent,</font>

410
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,940
<font color="yellow">and I was able to sign with them.</font>

411
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,370
<font color="yellow">You're such an asset to the company.</font>

412
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,070
<font color="yellow">The CEO of that company...</font>

413
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,140
<font color="yellow">is Director Byun.</font>

414
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,200
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae?</font>

415
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,770
<font color="yellow">Does this mean that he's the one who stole the blueprint?</font>

416
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,670
<font color="yellow">I don't know the details.</font>

417
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,440
<font color="yellow">What's important to me is who gets to sign the contract.</font>

418
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,770
<font color="yellow">Father, we can't pick and choose whom to work with.</font>

419
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,440
<font color="yellow">Our company's benefit is our priority.</font>

420
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
<font color="yellow">As long as we can secure the deal,</font>

421
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,340
<font color="yellow">I don't care about anything else.</font>

422
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,100
<font color="yellow">Please watch me. I won't disappoint you.</font>

423
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,740
<font color="yellow">He takes after you on how he does business.</font>

424
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,130
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo changed a lot these days, too.</font>

425
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,170
<font color="yellow">Did he?</font>

426
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,800
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

427
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,570
<font color="yellow">Didn't I report it to you already?</font>

428
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,070
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

429
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,440
<font color="yellow">You asked me to make a human out of him.</font>

430
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,200
<font color="yellow">When did I say that?</font>

431
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,900
<font color="yellow">Sir. Did you forget about the order you gave me?</font>

432
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,340
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

433
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,640
<font color="yellow">I have a headache.</font>

434
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,200
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

435
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,840
<font color="yellow">I remember it now.</font>

436
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,570
<font color="yellow">I told you...</font>

437
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,970
<font color="yellow">to teach him a lesson.</font>

438
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,300
<font color="yellow">It's time for the EGM.</font>

439
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,300
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

440
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,870
<font color="yellow">Is he all right?</font>

441
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,280
<font color="yellow">It's normal for a human to be forgetful sometimes.</font>

442
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,470
<font color="yellow">I've reported three times already, but he looked so clueless.</font>

443
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,430
<font color="yellow">I have to escort him for now.</font>

444
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,670
<font color="yellow">We'll talk later.</font>

445
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,800
<font color="yellow">How can he forget that...</font>

446
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,210
<font color="yellow">after making me the bad guy?</font>

447

<font color="yellow">(Dodo Group Extraordinary General Meeting)</font>

448
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,400
<font color="yellow">It's been a while, Chairman Do.</font>

449
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,300
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

450
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,970
<font color="yellow">An extraordinary general meeting isn't a party.</font>

451
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,240
<font color="yellow">Obviously, I'm not here for the food.</font>

452
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,640
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm asking.</font>

453
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,900
<font color="yellow">He came as a shareholder.</font>

454
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,140
<font color="yellow">I gave all my shares to him.</font>

455
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,940
<font color="yellow">Are you teaming up...</font>

456
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,300
<font color="yellow">to kick Gun Woo out?</font>

457
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,000
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of eyes on you.</font>

458
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,540
<font color="yellow">Don't you consider saving face more important than your wife?</font>

459
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,570
<font color="yellow">It won't...</font>

460
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,470
<font color="yellow">ever go as you planned.</font>

461
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,540
<font color="yellow">You'll see.</font>

462
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,300
<font color="yellow">When is Director Byun coming?</font>

463
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,570
<font color="yellow">He won't be late, don't worry.</font>

464
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,900
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

465
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,870
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

466
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,710
<font color="yellow">Il Jae's father-in-law is here.</font>

467

<font color="yellow">Are you sure he'll make the deal with you?</font>

468
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,100
<font color="yellow">According to my intelligence, the two of them...</font>

469
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,270
<font color="yellow">have gone their separate ways.</font>

470
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,680
<font color="yellow">Before we get into the issue of the Vice Chairman's position,</font>

471
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,970
<font color="yellow">the chairman will say a few words.</font>

472
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
<font color="yellow">- Let me.
- I'm fine. It's okay.</font>

473
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,710
<font color="yellow">I'll keep it short.</font>

474
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,840
<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo...</font>

475
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,270
<font color="yellow">has all but signed the contract...</font>

476
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,040
<font color="yellow">to produce...</font>

477
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
<font color="yellow">the vaccine to the mutant virus.</font>

478
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,070
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

479
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,600
<font color="yellow">Is this true?</font>

480
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,840
<font color="yellow">You must know...</font>

481
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,570
<font color="yellow">better than anyone what that means for...</font>

482
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,170
<font color="yellow">the future of our company.</font>

483
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,710
<font color="yellow">Of course, we do.</font>

484
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,950
<font color="yellow">If we sign the contract,</font>

485
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,090
<font color="yellow">then you must promote Vice Chairman Do.</font>

486
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,090
<font color="yellow">When will the contract be signed?</font>

487
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,240
<font color="yellow">The CEO of the company that developed it is here.</font>

488
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,600
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you again.</font>

489
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,270
<font color="yellow">Our shareholders would like to know...</font>

490
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,400
<font color="yellow">whom you decided to sign with.</font>

491
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,800
<font color="yellow">May I tell them myself?</font>

492
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,710
<font color="yellow">You may.</font>

493
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,400
<font color="yellow">I'm Byun Il Jae, the CEO of B World.</font>

494
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,210
<font color="yellow">I decided to enter into a technical partnership...</font>

495
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,210
<font color="yellow">with Dodo Group because...</font>

496
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,970
<font color="yellow">I was greatly moved...</font>

497
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,540
<font color="yellow">by one person's passion.</font>

498
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,300
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Do Gwang Woo.</font>

499
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,970
<font color="yellow">Come and join me.</font>

500
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,740
<font color="yellow">Put the vice chairman's dismissal to a vote.</font>

501
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,210
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we reinstate Do Gwang Woo as the CEO of Dodo Pharmaceutical?</font>

502
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,680
<font color="yellow">Let's lay an urgent bill and vote right now.</font>

503
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,470
<font color="yellow">Let's just vote.</font>

504
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,500
<font color="yellow">Let's vote.</font>

505
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,770
<font color="yellow">- Father.
- Dad!</font>

506
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,160
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
- Sir.</font>

507
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,710
<font color="yellow">- Father!
- Chairman!</font>

508
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,340
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
- Sir.</font>

509
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,490
<font color="yellow">Take him out.</font>

510
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,670
<font color="yellow">Gently.</font>

511
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,400
<font color="yellow">Mr Do just went into surgery.</font>

512
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,780
<font color="yellow">- Surgery?
- We'll have to wait and see,</font>

513
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,640
<font color="yellow">but the worst is over.</font>

514
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,570
<font color="yellow">Get the car ready.</font>

515
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

516
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,040
<font color="yellow">I know quite a few people...</font>

517
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,170
<font color="yellow">who would be devastated if my father collapsed.</font>

518
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,170
<font color="yellow">What are you implying?</font>

519
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

520
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,470
<font color="yellow">Don't put on a show.</font>

521
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,790
<font color="yellow">You aren't worried for him.</font>

522
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,640
<font color="yellow">You're worried for your future.</font>

523
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,140
<font color="yellow">Your father's in surgery.</font>

524
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

525
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,880
<font color="yellow">What did you say in your job interview?</font>

526
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,270
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to succeed and make your father pay.</font>

527
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,240
<font color="yellow">You got your way. You must be pleased.</font>

528
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,130
<font color="yellow">Did he really say that?</font>

529
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,740
<font color="yellow">Will you please stop?</font>

530
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,640
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

531
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,710
<font color="yellow">Send him away.</font>

532
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,000
<font color="yellow">Can I stay until he wakes up?</font>

533
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,300
<font color="yellow">Get him out of here.</font>

534
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,080
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, you can't do this.</font>

535
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,340
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

536
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,000
<font color="yellow">Do you want to join him?</font>

537
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,700
<font color="yellow">He is Chairman's son.</font>

538
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,040
<font color="yellow">- He should get to see...
- Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

539
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,210
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

540
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,570
<font color="yellow">Get him out of here.</font>

541
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,640
<font color="yellow">Until my husband is fully able,</font>

542
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,270
<font color="yellow">I will make all the important decisions.</font>

543
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,800
<font color="yellow">Do you both understand?</font>

544
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,940
<font color="yellow">There's one thing that those who dislike...</font>

545
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,710
<font color="yellow">and envy you don't know.</font>

546
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,300
<font color="yellow">They don't know how incredibly proud I am of you.</font>

547
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,540
<font color="yellow">Bear with me and hang in there.</font>

548
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,770
<font color="yellow">I will make you...</font>

549
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,000
<font color="yellow">a thousand times greater than you are now.</font>

550
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
<font color="yellow">No one...</font>

551
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,940
<font color="yellow">will be able to mock my son.</font>

552
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,210
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Father.</font>

553
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,240
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

554
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,370
<font color="yellow">I don't...</font>

555
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,170
<font color="yellow">pity you at all.</font>

556
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,570
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

557
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,000
<font color="yellow">You had everything.</font>

558
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,540
<font color="yellow">You tortured everybody.</font>

559
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,870
<font color="yellow">Don't get it wrong.</font>

560
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,500
<font color="yellow">These tears...</font>

561
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,100
<font color="yellow">are for poor, little me.</font>

562
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,770
<font color="yellow">You hated me all your life,</font>

563
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,670
<font color="yellow">and now, I can hate you back.</font>

564
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,940
<font color="yellow">I'm crying over the past that I lost.</font>

565
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,800
<font color="yellow">Lie here in comfort...</font>

566
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
<font color="yellow">and watch what I do next.</font>

567
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,870
<font color="yellow">You used me...</font>

568
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,270
<font color="yellow">to create this world.</font>

569
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,140
<font color="yellow">Now, I'm in control.</font>

570
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,440
<font color="yellow">(Hwang Gwi Ja, Dodo's Interim Chairperson)</font>

571
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,740
<font color="yellow">Chairwoman is here.</font>

572
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,800
<font color="yellow">Take this opportunity...</font>

573
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,670
<font color="yellow">to get rid of all your father's allies.</font>

574
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,670
<font color="yellow">He'll come back to Korea once he recovers.</font>

575
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,500
<font color="yellow">What if he gets furious?</font>

576
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
<font color="yellow">He might not come back to work.</font>

577
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,280
<font color="yellow">He's making progress.</font>

578
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,370
<font color="yellow">That's why we have to work fast.</font>

579
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,800
<font color="yellow">So he can't do anything on his return.</font>

580
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,300
<font color="yellow">What about Gun Woo?</font>

581
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,740
<font color="yellow">He lost his title.</font>

582
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,200
<font color="yellow">Deal with him later to avoid scrutiny.</font>

583
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,200
<font color="yellow">Look at all these names.</font>

584
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,140
<font color="yellow">I wonder whom I should start with first.</font>

585
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500
<font color="yellow">It's so much work.</font>

586
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
<font color="yellow">Starting today,</font>

587
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,370
<font color="yellow">we will shuffle personnel and restructure the organisation.</font>

588
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:21,900
<font color="yellow">CEO Do Gwang Woo...</font>

589
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,780
<font color="yellow">will be in charge.</font>

590
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chairwoman.</font>

591
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,770
<font color="yellow">Before we begin...</font>

592
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,770
<font color="yellow">Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

593
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

594
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,140
<font color="yellow">I looked into the people in the Secretary's Office.</font>

595
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,640
<font color="yellow">I can charge you for embezzlement.</font>

596
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,640
<font color="yellow">Embezzlement?</font>

597
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,340
<font color="yellow">Embezzlement?</font>

598
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,070
<font color="yellow">That never happened.</font>

599
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,240
<font color="yellow">That's the company's credit card statement...</font>

600
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,070
<font color="yellow">and records of your operating expenses.</font>

601
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,570
<font color="yellow">Explain those to me.</font>

602
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
<font color="yellow">These were fabricated.</font>

603
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,670
<font color="yellow">I swear that...</font>

604
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,440
<font color="yellow">these purchases were never made.</font>

605
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,300
<font color="yellow">Do Gwang Woo.</font>

606
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,970
<font color="yellow">I worked here my whole life.</font>

607
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,870
<font color="yellow">Now, I'll spend...</font>

608
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,570
<font color="yellow">the rest of my life working towards tearing you down.</font>

609
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,240
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

610
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,440
<font color="yellow">When will you wake up?</font>

611
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,700
<font color="yellow">I can't leave until you do.</font>

612
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,300
<font color="yellow">Because of you,</font>

613
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,770
<font color="yellow">my life changed in many...</font>

614
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,070
<font color="yellow">Can you hear me?</font>

615
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
<font color="yellow">Do it again.</font>

616
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,000
<font color="yellow">Move your fingers.</font>

617
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,700
<font color="yellow">He moved.</font>

618
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,600
<font color="yellow">I saw his fingers twitch.</font>

619
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,070
<font color="yellow">Were you mistaken?</font>

620
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,770
<font color="yellow">I'm positive.</font>

621
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,170
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you glare like that in a while.</font>

622
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,370
<font color="yellow">This is what I wanted from you.</font>

623
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,600
<font color="yellow">Lonely, angry and determined to win.</font>
