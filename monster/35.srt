00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,990
<font color="yellow">- It was nice to meet you all.
-  Thank you.</font>

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,520
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you.</font>

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Uncle.</font>

5
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,520
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you in prison.</font>

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,860
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

7
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,360
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae.</font>

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,890
<font color="yellow">You're under arrest for violating election laws.</font>

9
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,660
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,260
<font color="yellow">This is the teaser.</font>

11
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,260
<font color="yellow">There's more to come.</font>

12
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,790
<font color="yellow">Murder, abduction, illegal slush funds and more.</font>

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,360
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, how dare you...</font>

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,870
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

15
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,890
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,790
<font color="yellow">Now he's cheating children as well.</font>

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,760
<font color="yellow">There's still a long way to go...</font>

18
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,820
<font color="yellow">in order to reveal his true self.</font>

19
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,860
<font color="yellow">Do you admit to the contents of the recording released on broadcast?</font>

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,060
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen the broadcast yet.</font>

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,620
<font color="yellow">Cho Cham, the candidate that supported you,</font>

22
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,930
<font color="yellow">confessed to the prosecution that he received bribery.</font>

23
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,230
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

24
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,590
<font color="yellow">That means this incident must be...</font>

25
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,560
<font color="yellow">a political conspiracy.</font>

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,550
<font color="yellow">Are you saying someone is trying to frame you?</font>

27
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,920
<font color="yellow">There is no way he would say that otherwise.</font>

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,090
<font color="yellow">You've been elected as the mayor of Seoul.</font>

29
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,120
<font color="yellow">Please comment.</font>

30
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,420
<font color="yellow">For all the Seoul citizens who have given...</font>

31
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,160
<font color="yellow">their precious votes to me,</font>

32
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,890
<font color="yellow">I will fight against all of these suspicions...</font>

33
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,080
<font color="yellow">and conspiracies until the end. Please watch me.</font>

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,160
<font color="yellow">Please move out of the way.</font>

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,890
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that you're innocent? Are you?</font>

36
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,420
<font color="yellow">Please give us an answer.</font>

37
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised? Did you see a ghost or something?</font>

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,460
<font color="yellow">Are you surprised to see someone...</font>

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,960
<font color="yellow">you thought was dead?</font>

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,060
<font color="yellow">I'm Oh Soo Yeon.</font>

41
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,990
<font color="yellow">The one you tried to kidnap and murder.</font>

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,020
<font color="yellow">I was wondering who would frame me,</font>

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,290
<font color="yellow">but it must have been you and Gi Tan.</font>

44
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,260
<font color="yellow">Say that in the interrogation room.</font>

45
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,020
<font color="yellow">The more you talk about the past,</font>

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,460
<font color="yellow">the better it is for us.</font>

47
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,190
<font color="yellow">My brother and Gi Tan's parents...</font>

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,190
<font color="yellow">Right, there's one more.</font>

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,420
<font color="yellow">Your late wife.</font>

50
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,090
<font color="yellow">Once the world finds out what you did to those people,</font>

51
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,120
<font color="yellow">you'll never...</font>

52
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,320
<font color="yellow">see the light of day again.</font>

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,090
<font color="yellow">A lawyer...</font>

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,220
<font color="yellow">should be more careful with her words.</font>

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,690
<font color="yellow">You should only say things you can be responsible for.</font>

56
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,860
<font color="yellow">Okay, Lawyer Oh?</font>

57
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,320
<font color="yellow">If it's bothering you, sue me for defamation.</font>

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,020
<font color="yellow">That's what I prefer.</font>

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,590
<font color="yellow">That's enough, Lawyer Oh. You'll scare the detective.</font>

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,190
<font color="yellow">Poor thing.</font>

61
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,520
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have any honour left to be ruined.</font>

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,460
<font color="yellow">How can he sue you for defamation?</font>

63
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,990
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep listening to them?</font>

64
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,990
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

65
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,720
<font color="yellow">We're late. I have to go see Cho Cham.</font>

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,170
<font color="yellow">Can you find out how it's going at the prosecutor's office?</font>

67
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,260
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

68
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,790
<font color="yellow">We should find out what his prosecutor is like.</font>

69
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,690
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll put in a call. Go to the fifth floor...</font>

70
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,590
<font color="yellow">and ask for Detective Yang Jin Soo.</font>

71
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,990
<font color="yellow">He's the informant here, so he'll tell you almost everything.</font>

72
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,990
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

73
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,860
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

74
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,660
<font color="yellow">Seoul Mayor Byun Il Jae claimed innocence,</font>

75
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,690
<font color="yellow">but the prosecution is said to have already acquired...</font>

76
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,280
<font color="yellow">the confession of the independent candidate Cho Cham...</font>

77
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,620
<font color="yellow">Will Gun Woo be all right?</font>

78
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
<font color="yellow">He has...</font>

79
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,060
<font color="yellow">the support from the shareholders thanks to Il Jae.</font>

80
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,160
<font color="yellow">You make no sense.</font>

81
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,500
<font color="yellow">Why would Gun Woo and Il Jae part ways because of Soo Yeon?</font>

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,890
<font color="yellow">I'm sure of it.</font>

83
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,620
<font color="yellow">The EGM is around the corner. Gun Woo would never do this.</font>

84
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,020
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,960
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo...</font>

86
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,590
<font color="yellow">is nothing but a bird without wings.</font>

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,620
<font color="yellow">I just got a call from the secretary's office.</font>

88
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,790
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is holding a dinner with the shareholders.</font>

89
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,930
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

90
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,490
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo must be nervous.</font>

91
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,920
<font color="yellow">That's why he's meeting with the shareholders.</font>

92
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,850
<font color="yellow">Get me the list of attendees for the dinner.</font>

93
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,390
<font color="yellow">I'll call them myself.</font>

94
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,420
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

95
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,160
<font color="yellow">Those disloyal shareholders are trying to flatter Gun Woo.</font>

96
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,010
<font color="yellow">I don't like them.</font>

97
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,340
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't like them, it's time for a carrot, not a stick.</font>

98
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,160
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about losing your temper.</font>

99
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,790
<font color="yellow">The sun is right above us.</font>

100
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,920
<font color="yellow">What are you scared of? We should say whatever we want.</font>

101
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,990
<font color="yellow">History changes...</font>

102
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,290
<font color="yellow">not because of the loyal subjects but because of the disloyal ones.</font>

103
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
<font color="yellow">You'll see.</font>

104
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,220
<font color="yellow">They'll be the ones that help us take over Dodo Group.</font>

105
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,520
<font color="yellow">Wow. My mum became so smart...</font>

106
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,720
<font color="yellow">after becoming the chairwoman.</font>

107
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,520
<font color="yellow">Do you think your father was so smart to begin with?</font>

108
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,690
<font color="yellow">The position makes the person.</font>

109
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,420
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

110
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,390
<font color="yellow">It's Gun Woo.</font>

111
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,060
<font color="yellow">Where are the shareholders?</font>

112
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,360
<font color="yellow">They're already in our room.</font>

113
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,590
<font color="yellow">The shareholders are in a different room.</font>

114
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,160
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? It was supposed to be here.</font>

115
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,820
<font color="yellow">Chairwoman Hwang snatched them away.</font>

116
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,090
<font color="yellow">Where are they meeting?</font>

117
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
<font color="yellow">You all heard that...</font>

118
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,760
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do can't move around...</font>

119
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,630
<font color="yellow">without his wheelchair, right?</font>

120
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,760
<font color="yellow">Is it that bad?</font>

121
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,160
<font color="yellow">I heard that he'll be participating in the next EGM.</font>

122
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,460
<font color="yellow">Of course he would like to.</font>

123
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,620
<font color="yellow">But he collapsed just a few days ago...</font>

124
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,690
<font color="yellow">and was sent to the hospital.</font>

125
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,090
<font color="yellow">All right. I won't take long.</font>

126
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,260
<font color="yellow">Raise your hands if you agree...</font>

127
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,060
<font color="yellow">on dismissing Vice Chairman Do during the EGM.</font>

128
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,160
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that things have changed?</font>

130
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,260
<font color="yellow">If you want to extend your contracts, you should be wise.</font>

131
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,790
<font color="yellow">Well... What about Director Byun?</font>

132
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,190
<font color="yellow">Director Byun...</font>

133
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,690
<font color="yellow">had a falling out with Vice Chairman Do.</font>

134
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,830
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

135
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,820
<font color="yellow">Why would I make things up?</font>

136
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,930
<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman Do.</font>

137
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,820
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

138
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,490
<font color="yellow">That's what I'd like to ask.</font>

139
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,020
<font color="yellow">These people had a meeting with me. Why did you snatch them away?</font>

140
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

141
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,300
<font color="yellow">I dragged them over here?</font>

142
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,960
<font color="yellow">They came on their own will.</font>

143
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,990
<font color="yellow">Chairwoman, don't get so upset.</font>

144
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,960
<font color="yellow">Since Vice Chairman Do is here,</font>

145
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,820
<font color="yellow">why don't you check?</font>

146
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,660
<font color="yellow">Is it true that you and Director Byun had a falling out?</font>

147
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,960
<font color="yellow">Don't bother lying.</font>

148
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,930
<font color="yellow">It'll make you look pathetic.</font>

149
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,820
<font color="yellow">All right. Let me ask you again.</font>

151
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,960
<font color="yellow">Raise your hands if you agree...</font>

152
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,090
<font color="yellow">on dismissing Vice Chairman Do during the EGM.</font>

153
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,430
<font color="yellow">Hey! Is that up or down?</font>

154
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,350
<font color="yellow">All right, all right.</font>

155
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,760
<font color="yellow">We can gather at the EGM with our chairwoman in the lead.</font>

156
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,720
<font color="yellow">For Chairwoman Hwang!</font>

157
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,960
<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman Do.</font>

158
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,220
<font color="yellow">Are you going to stay there?</font>

159
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,290
<font color="yellow">You're making everyone uncomfortable.</font>

160
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,060
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gun Woo.</font>

161
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,890
<font color="yellow">Did you see that?</font>

162
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,320
<font color="yellow">You're nothing without Il Jae.</font>

163
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,960
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon will just use you and abandon you, too.</font>

164
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,190
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter what happens between Il Jae and me.</font>

165
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,790
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group is my father's company and it's where I work.</font>

166
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,890
<font color="yellow">Are you still lost?</font>

167
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

168
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,220
<font color="yellow">Dodo Group is mine. I'm the heir.</font>

169
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,590
<font color="yellow">Only the people I approve of will be working here.</font>

170
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,160
<font color="yellow">That's why you should just get lost.</font>

171
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,060
<font color="yellow">Stop embarrassing the family. Do you understand?</font>

172
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,560
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't Lawyer Oh know about this?</font>

173
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,060
<font color="yellow">She should know what kind of trouble you put yourself in to help...</font>

174
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
<font color="yellow">It was my decision so I should deal with it myself.</font>

175
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,890
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything to Soo Yeon.</font>

176
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

177
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,560
<font color="yellow">Gwi Ja and Gwang Woo.</font>

178
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
<font color="yellow">You should've left while I was still nice.</font>

179
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,790
<font color="yellow">I couldn't have been taken down like this...</font>

180
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,720
<font color="yellow">without a traitor inside.</font>

181
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,760
<font color="yellow">Before that, I have to prepare something.</font>

182
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,680
<font color="yellow">Money and trust.</font>

183
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,300
<font color="yellow">- Trust?
-  Without trust,</font>

184
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,790
<font color="yellow">this scheme will fail.</font>

185
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,620
<font color="yellow">How much do you trust me?</font>

186
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,860
<font color="yellow">How much do I have to trust you?</font>

187
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,990
<font color="yellow">Completely.</font>

188
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,520
<font color="yellow">Could it be?</font>

189
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,660
<font color="yellow">Could the traitor be...</font>

190
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,120
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung?</font>

191
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,220
<font color="yellow">You don't have much time, Sir.</font>

192
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,660
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

193
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,600
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

194
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,560
<font color="yellow">Call my father-in-law first.</font>

195
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Oh.</font>

196
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,360
<font color="yellow">It's me, Father.</font>

197
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,760
<font color="yellow">I have a favour to ask you.</font>

198
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

199
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,830
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

200
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,390
<font color="yellow">I have no intention of helping you,</font>

201
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,760
<font color="yellow">so don't even think about it!</font>

202
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,990
<font color="yellow">Who was that?</font>

203
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,590
<font color="yellow">Il Jae.</font>

204
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,620
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

205
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,590
<font color="yellow">Won't you really help Il Jae at all?</font>

206
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,990
<font color="yellow">I told you, I've abandoned him.</font>

207
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,890
<font color="yellow">Don't make me repeat things.</font>

208
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,190
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

209
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,220
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

210
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,790
<font color="yellow">Let him be alone.</font>

211
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,890
<font color="yellow">He's like that because he's upset.</font>

212
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,160
<font color="yellow">Once he calms down, he'll help Mayor Byun.</font>

213
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,570
<font color="yellow">My father-in-law is treating me like an abandoned child.</font>

214
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,590
<font color="yellow">I'll go over...</font>

215
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,850
<font color="yellow">and find out what he's thinking.</font>

216
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,100
<font color="yellow">Keep your eyes on Chae Ryung, too.</font>

217
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,390
<font color="yellow">I've always been suspicious of her.</font>

218
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,990
<font color="yellow">Head over to the interrogation room.</font>

219
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,210
<font color="yellow">Why are you here instead of the chief prosecutor?</font>

220
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,320
<font color="yellow">I'll start the interrogation.</font>

221
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,790
<font color="yellow">Interrogation?</font>

222
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,090
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's your name?</font>

223
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,390
<font color="yellow">Park Yeong Sik.</font>

224
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,960
<font color="yellow">Okay. Prosecutor Park.</font>

225
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,290
<font color="yellow">Tell your boss, Chief Prosecutor Ko, to come in immediately.</font>

226
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,140
<font color="yellow">I will tell him about the truth behind the incident...</font>

227
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,520
<font color="yellow">and teach him what the course of the investigation should be.</font>

228
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,460
<font color="yellow">Please keep your manners.</font>

229
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,160
<font color="yellow">You're sitting there as a suspect.</font>

230
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,120
<font color="yellow">So did Cho Cham say that he got money from me?</font>

231
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,320
<font color="yellow">Bring him here.</font>

232
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,020
<font color="yellow">You'll save much of your time if you conduct a cross-examination.</font>

233
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,790
<font color="yellow">Conduct the cross-examination.</font>

234
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chief.</font>

235
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,490
<font color="yellow">Please, sit.</font>

236
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,320
<font color="yellow">Please wait.</font>

237
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,460
<font color="yellow">If you don't like the question,</font>

238
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,720
<font color="yellow">you have the right to remain silent.</font>

239
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,260
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

240
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,990
<font color="yellow">You have already...</font>

241
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,620
<font color="yellow">become his lawyer.</font>

242
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,910
<font color="yellow">You're quicker than I thought, Lawyer Min.</font>

243
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,090
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't try anything.</font>

244
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,820
<font color="yellow">I've already given all the evidence to the prosecution.</font>

245
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,660
<font color="yellow">Did you say it was a voice recording?</font>

246
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,720
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mr Cho.</font>

247
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,790
<font color="yellow">Do you know who reported the voice recording?</font>

248
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,190
<font color="yellow">It's a man named Kang Gi Tan.</font>

249
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,590
<font color="yellow">Also, there's a woman named Oh Soo Yeon...</font>

250
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,520
<font color="yellow">who broadcasted the recording and she works with Lawyer Min.</font>

251
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,620
<font color="yellow">They're all in this together. How can you fall for this?</font>

252
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,760
<font color="yellow">See? Wasn't that exactly the same?</font>

253
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,920
<font color="yellow">I told you he'd say that.</font>

254
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,040
<font color="yellow">My goodness, you almost said it word by word.</font>

255
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,760
<font color="yellow">I should be in fortune-telling business.</font>

256
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,320
<font color="yellow">Mr Byun.</font>

257
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,190
<font color="yellow">Let's stop sinning.</font>

258
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,620
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

259
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,890
<font color="yellow">Do you have...</font>

260
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,860
<font color="yellow">anything more you'd like to say?</font>

261
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,490
<font color="yellow">In my opinion,</font>

262
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,570
<font color="yellow">I think you should keep it...</font>

263
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,990
<font color="yellow">and say those things in front of the prosecutor.</font>

264
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,660
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

265
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,990
<font color="yellow">I have to get my insulin shot for my diabetes.</font>

266
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,090
<font color="yellow">Right, of course. Go ahead.</font>

267
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,830
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

268
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,890
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

269
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

270
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,560
<font color="yellow">Tell Soo Yeon this.</font>

271
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,690
<font color="yellow">I will make sure...</font>

272
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,880
<font color="yellow">to hold the broadcast production crew...</font>

273
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,130
<font color="yellow">legally responsible for this.</font>

274
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,110
<font color="yellow">Oh, I should deliver that message to Chairman K...</font>

275
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,320
<font color="yellow">instead of Lawyer Oh.</font>

276
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,630
<font color="yellow">It looked like he was already getting ready for a lawsuit.</font>

277
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,590
<font color="yellow">If not, that's fine too.</font>

278
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,830
<font color="yellow">Chief.</font>

279
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,360
<font color="yellow">You should take Mr Byun in custody for the investigation.</font>

280
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,760
<font color="yellow">- If you get in deeper...
-  I'll take care of that.</font>

281
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,820
<font color="yellow">Go back to the room.</font>

282
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,020
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

283
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,190
<font color="yellow">There was a tip-off that Chief Prosecutor Ko is...</font>

284
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,810
<font color="yellow">in a close relationship with Il Jae.</font>

285
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,100
<font color="yellow">If he lobbied the prosecutors with the money...</font>

286
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,560
<font color="yellow">from his paper company,</font>

287
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,590
<font color="yellow">he's probably not the only one.</font>

288
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,390
<font color="yellow">The door is closing.</font>

289
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,800
<font color="yellow">This is the menu for those Chinese shipowners.</font>

290
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,060
<font color="yellow">Let Chief Secretary Moon see it.</font>

291
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,390
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to check it yourself?</font>

292
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,790
<font color="yellow">I'm busy.</font>

293
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,920
<font color="yellow">Anyways,</font>

294
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,110
<font color="yellow">why are you two together?</font>

295
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,220
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

296
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,160
<font color="yellow">Why are they together? I really want to know.</font>

297
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,660
<font color="yellow">Wait, I thought Soo Yeon had a thing with Gun Woo.</font>

298
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,290
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon is much prettier in real life than on television.</font>

299
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,800
<font color="yellow">Did you say Soo Yeon is pretty?</font>

300
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,390
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

301
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,130
<font color="yellow">And she must be smart since she's a lawyer.</font>

302
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,690
<font color="yellow">Stop speaking nonsense and find Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

303
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

304
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,490
<font color="yellow">My goodness, I really don't like how she's with Ga Din.</font>

305
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,890
<font color="yellow">It's not the time to stay still, Father.</font>

306
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,460
<font color="yellow">The man who was bribed turned himself in. What can I do?</font>

307
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,990
<font color="yellow">You've taken care of incidents that were larger than this.</font>

308
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,290
<font color="yellow">Will you please help?</font>

309
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,720
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo.</font>

310
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,520
<font color="yellow">Have you thought about divorcing Il Jae?</font>

311
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,160
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

312
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,790
<font color="yellow">I don't trust him.</font>

313
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,130
<font color="yellow">There will come a day when he abandons you.</font>

314
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,020
<font color="yellow">- So now...
-  You once said...</font>

315
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,870
<font color="yellow">he was the most precious person to you.</font>

316
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,130
<font color="yellow">- Ji Soo.
-  You only do what's good for you.</font>

317
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,580
<font color="yellow">Is this who you really are?</font>

318
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,590
<font color="yellow">If it was for me, I wouldn't abandon him.</font>

319
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,600
<font color="yellow">It's all because of you, you idiot.</font>

320
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,020
<font color="yellow">I don't need your help.</font>

321
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,520
<font color="yellow">I will step up and save Il Jae.</font>

322
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

323
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,020
<font color="yellow">once this is over, I'm moving out of this house.</font>

324
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,760
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

325
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,610
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell her that he's having an affair with Chae Ryung?</font>

326
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,160
<font color="yellow">I don't need to make things worse.</font>

327
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,960
<font color="yellow">I'll first conduct a background check on Chae Ryung.</font>

328
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,860
<font color="yellow">It won't be too late to break the news after that.</font>

329
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,870
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way.</font>

330
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,990
<font color="yellow">What about you, Mr Moon?</font>

331
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,960
<font color="yellow">I'll be arriving shortly.</font>

332
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,000
<font color="yellow">There's a car that's been tailing me.</font>

333
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,090
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

334
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,790
<font color="yellow">If you think someone is following, let's meet another time.</font>

335
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,260
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

336
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,320
<font color="yellow">I was being too sensitive.</font>

337
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,090
<font color="yellow">I think I'll be about 20 minutes late.</font>

338
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,320
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung is near the intersection.</font>

339
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

340
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,190
<font color="yellow">I found her.</font>

341
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,320
<font color="yellow">I'll tail her starting now.</font>

342
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,520
<font color="yellow">I think it's best...</font>

343
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,420
<font color="yellow">for you to stop being a double spy.</font>

344
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,690
<font color="yellow">The prosecution will likely investigate him without detention.</font>

345
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,220
<font color="yellow">If he's released, we don't know what he'll do before the trial.</font>

346
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,710
<font color="yellow">You probably still need my help.</font>

347
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,920
<font color="yellow">Il Jae...</font>

348
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,040
<font color="yellow">must be suspicious of you by now.</font>

349
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,790
<font color="yellow">This isn't the first time for me to be in a situation like this.</font>

350
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,520
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.</font>

351
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,420
<font color="yellow">This has a GPS on it.</font>

352
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,790
<font color="yellow">If you press the side, we can track you.</font>

353
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,690
<font color="yellow">If you're ever in trouble, send us a signal.</font>

354
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,860
<font color="yellow">You're really prepared.</font>

355
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,160
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon!</font>

356
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,520
<font color="yellow">How is Gi Tan?</font>

357
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,420
<font color="yellow">He's in touch with Soo Yeon, right? Is he all right?</font>

358
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,390
<font color="yellow">I heard from Professor Jin.</font>

359
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,680
<font color="yellow">The chairman wanted to erase his memories about Soo Yeon...</font>

360
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,190
<font color="yellow">I guess Gi Tan must know by now...</font>

361
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,690
<font color="yellow">- that it was my doing.
-  I didn't tell him.</font>

362
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,620
<font color="yellow">Let's just finish this job first.</font>

363
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,020
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

364
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,620
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

365
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,290
<font color="yellow">I have evidence that Chae Ryung is betraying us.</font>

366
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,590
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

367
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,590
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

368
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,490
<font color="yellow">Chief Prosecutor Ko.</font>

369
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,360
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

370
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,420
<font color="yellow">Finish your meal first, Sir.</font>

371
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,460
<font color="yellow">Suspend the prosecution and let me out.</font>

372
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,790
<font color="yellow">It's too late for that.</font>

373
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,000
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

374
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,790
<font color="yellow">let me out without detention and give me an acquittal at court.</font>

375
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,060
<font color="yellow">I wish I could,</font>

376
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,790
<font color="yellow">but I'll be punished by my superiors.</font>

377
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,690
<font color="yellow">Who? Tell me who.</font>

378
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,000
<font color="yellow">I'll ruin them for you.</font>

379
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,020
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

380
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,120
<font color="yellow">You were delighted when you took my money, but now you're acting...</font>

381
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,260
<font color="yellow">like you don't know anything?</font>

382
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
<font color="yellow">Do I look that easy to you?</font>

383
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,690
<font color="yellow">They can hear you. Please lower your voice.</font>

384
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,790
<font color="yellow">Tell them to go ahead!</font>

385
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,390
<font color="yellow">The moment I'm convicted,</font>

386
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,920
<font color="yellow">there will be many of you leaving here with me!</font>

387
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,390
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

388
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,120
<font color="yellow">I'll try my best to get you out without detention.</font>

389
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,590
<font color="yellow">That's as far as I can go.</font>

390
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,790
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

391
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,620
<font color="yellow">recording this?</font>

392
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,860
<font color="yellow">I turned it off.</font>

393
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,690
<font color="yellow">First, get Kang Gi Tan and Oh Soo Yeon,</font>

394
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,520
<font color="yellow">and ruin them.</font>

395
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,100
<font color="yellow">Charge them for tax evasion or lobbying.</font>

396
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,060
<font color="yellow">If you do enough research, I'm sure you'll find something.</font>

397
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,890
<font color="yellow">If we can tie them down,</font>

398
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,460
<font color="yellow">I won't be convicted at court.</font>

399
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,830
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

400
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,590
<font color="yellow">the only way for all of us to survive.</font>

401
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,180
<font color="yellow">How can I help you?</font>

402
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,570
<font color="yellow">We're from the National Tax Service. You're convicted for tax evasion.</font>

403
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,690
<font color="yellow">Tax evasion?</font>

404
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,690
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

405
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,060
<font color="yellow">How can we dodge taxes when we haven't earned anything?</font>

406
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,590
<font color="yellow">How can you just barge in here and talk of such nonsense?</font>

407
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,020
<font color="yellow">We need to investigate. Please cooperate with us.</font>

408
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,960
<font color="yellow">Wait...</font>

409
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,820
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

410
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,290
<font color="yellow">Can you at least tell me who reported us?</font>

411
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lawyer Min.</font>

412
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,890
<font color="yellow">What? Tax evasion?</font>

413
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,490
<font color="yellow">It's a mess over here.</font>

414
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,790
<font color="yellow">Do you know anyone that could have reported us?</font>

415
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,390
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll come to the office right now.</font>

416
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,360
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, tax evasion?</font>

417
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,490
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. I better go back to the office.</font>

418
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

419
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,060
<font color="yellow">There are detectives outside.</font>

420
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,220
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

421
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,790
<font color="yellow">Are you Chairman K?</font>

422
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,620
<font color="yellow">What is this regarding?</font>

423
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,490
<font color="yellow">- Are you Moon Tae Gwang?
-  Yes.</font>

424
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,790
<font color="yellow">The two of you are charged for illegal lobbying. Come with us.</font>

425
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,690
<font color="yellow">Illegal lobbying? On what grounds?</font>

426
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,120
<font color="yellow">I can tell who's behind this.</font>

427
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,160
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  A sudden investigation...</font>

428
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,320
<font color="yellow">on tax evasion and illegal lobbying?</font>

429
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,460
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that it's Il Jae's doing?</font>

430
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,090
<font color="yellow">I'm almost certain about this.</font>

431
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,960
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and just go back to the office.</font>

432
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,390
<font color="yellow">Let me make a call.</font>

433
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,790
<font color="yellow">It's me, Father.</font>

434
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,690
<font color="yellow">There's a problem with the business.</font>

435
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,690
<font color="yellow">Look who it is. It's Gi Tan.</font>

436
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,360
<font color="yellow">Chief Prosecutor Ko, why are these people here?</font>

437
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,520
<font color="yellow">They were charged...</font>

438
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,360
<font color="yellow">on suspicion of illegal lobbying.</font>

439
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,820
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way out after getting my leave without detention.</font>

440
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,290
<font color="yellow">This is what one's power can do.</font>

441
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,920
<font color="yellow">I'm not the same man who used to crawl at your aunt's feet.</font>

442
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,690
<font color="yellow">You're trying to reveal my corrupted doings?</font>

443
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,960
<font color="yellow">Once I start my term as the Seoul Mayor,</font>

444
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,520
<font color="yellow">you won't even get to see me eye to eye, Guk Cheol.</font>

445
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,560
<font color="yellow">Chief. We just received...</font>

446
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,260
<font color="yellow">a call from the Chinese Consulate.</font>

447
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,160
<font color="yellow">The charge has been dismissed,</font>

448
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,020
<font color="yellow">so you may leave.</font>

449
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,720
<font color="yellow">Are you Chief Prosecutor Ko?</font>

450
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,790
<font color="yellow">We will be looking into...</font>

451
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,190
<font color="yellow">this incident in detail.</font>

452
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,590
<font color="yellow">My apologies.</font>

453
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,890
<font color="yellow">There must have been a mistake.</font>

454
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,860
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

455
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,690
<font color="yellow">Power, you say?</font>

456
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,220
<font color="yellow">I'm not the same Guk Cheol you used to know.</font>

457
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,790
<font color="yellow">It's an eye for an eye.</font>

458
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,860
<font color="yellow">I'll put up a good fight,</font>

459
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,790
<font color="yellow">so get yourself ready.</font>

460
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,020
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

461
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,660
<font color="yellow">A complaint came into...</font>

462
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,690
<font color="yellow">the Chinese consulate through a high office in China.</font>

463
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,390
<font color="yellow">We don't have enough evidence.</font>

464
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,620
<font color="yellow">If this gets out of hand, we'll be the one in trouble.</font>

465
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,190
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're out.</font>

466
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,290
<font color="yellow">I was hoping you'd come.</font>

467
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,100
<font color="yellow">You must have read my mind.</font>

468
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir. I should have been more careful.</font>

469
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,390
<font color="yellow">I just met Gi Tan.</font>

470
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,290
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

471
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,680
<font color="yellow">It was just because...</font>

472
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,200
<font color="yellow">his moves were a bit smarter than ours.</font>

473
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,490
<font color="yellow">It is my fault.</font>

474
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,970
<font color="yellow">I will do anything for you to receive...</font>

475
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,660
<font color="yellow">a judgment of acquittal.</font>

476
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,490
<font color="yellow">I also let my guard down, too.</font>

477
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,590
<font color="yellow">We can't do this together if you continue to blame yourself.</font>

478
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

479
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,590
<font color="yellow">I am sorry that I worried you.</font>

480
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,090
<font color="yellow">I have something to say to you.</font>

481
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

482
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,020
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

483
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,590
<font color="yellow">advised and warned you many times...</font>

484
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,660
<font color="yellow">not to cheat in any way.</font>

485
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,660
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

486
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,390
<font color="yellow">nothing to say.</font>

487
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,590
<font color="yellow">What is...</font>

488
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,460
<font color="yellow">your relationship...</font>

489
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,620
<font color="yellow">with Chae Ryung?</font>

490
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,120
<font color="yellow">You must know...</font>

491
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,290
<font color="yellow">why I am asking.</font>

492
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,560
<font color="yellow">It is nothing like...</font>

493
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,020
<font color="yellow">what you think it is.</font>

494
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,390
<font color="yellow">Open this.</font>

495
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,860
<font color="yellow">What will you do...</font>

496
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,190
<font color="yellow">with Chae Ryung?</font>

497
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,990
<font color="yellow">Now that I know she's a traitor,</font>

498
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,720
<font color="yellow">I'll use her for my benefits.</font>

499
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,890
<font color="yellow">For your benefits?</font>

500
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,020
<font color="yellow">If we use her well,</font>

501
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,660
<font color="yellow">she will give us a lot of benefits, too.</font>

502
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
<font color="yellow">This is bad.</font>

503
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,260
<font color="yellow">The independent prosecutor act has come into effect.</font>

504
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,560
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

505
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,620
<font color="yellow">The independent prosecutor act?</font>

506
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,860
<font color="yellow">The independent prosecutor act has come into effect...</font>

507
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,560
<font color="yellow">regarding Mayor Byun's violation of election law.</font>

508
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,090
<font color="yellow">National Assembly's Committee on Ethics decided...</font>

509
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,920
<font color="yellow">to put this into effect...</font>

510
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,860
<font color="yellow">to relieve the people's suspicions on corrupt politicians.</font>

511
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,530
<font color="yellow">What happens after the act has gone effective?</font>

512
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,860
<font color="yellow">The chairman of the National Assembly...</font>

513
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,430
<font color="yellow">makes a request to the president.</font>

514
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,680
<font color="yellow">Then a special prosecutor is recommended among lawyers...</font>

515
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,580
<font color="yellow">of Korean Bar Association.</font>

516
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,890
<font color="yellow">The tides are high,</font>

517
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,190
<font color="yellow">so there will be many big fish.</font>

518
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,590
<font color="yellow">It's not small enough for Il Jae to cover,</font>

519
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,560
<font color="yellow">so Jae Man will step up.</font>

520
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,090
<font color="yellow">What kind of a man is the chairman?</font>

521
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,880
<font color="yellow">He's known as an honest and an upright man.</font>

522
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,990
<font color="yellow">He wasn't on good terms with Jae Man since they were representatives.</font>

523
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,860
<font color="yellow">If Jae Man decides to step in,</font>

524
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,490
<font color="yellow">he'll approach the chairman.</font>

525
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,160
<font color="yellow">Do you have any connections?</font>

526
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,590
<font color="yellow">I can ask the Chinese ambassador.</font>

527
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,370
<font color="yellow">He can get him to have a meal with me.</font>

528
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,780
<font color="yellow">Right, there was the Chinese ambassador.</font>

529
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,620
<font color="yellow">Why don't we eat Chinese tonight?</font>

530
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,790
<font color="yellow">(Father)</font>

531
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,770
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

532
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,580
<font color="yellow">Chairman got here a bit early because there wasn't much traffic.</font>

533
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,620
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

534
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,750
<font color="yellow">Please tell the ambassador that I will...</font>

535
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,970
<font color="yellow">thank him myself.</font>

536
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,820
<font color="yellow">Sure. Go ahead.</font>

537
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,890
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

538
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,060
<font color="yellow">I am Kang Gi Tan.</font>

539
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,090
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

540
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,560
<font color="yellow">I've heard about you from Ambassador Wang.</font>

541
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,080
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I'm late.</font>

542
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,340
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

543
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,860
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit too meticulous, that's all.</font>

544
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:58,190
<font color="yellow">It's been a while, Mr Hwang.</font>

545
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,790
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

546
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,360
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

547
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,620
<font color="yellow">I love how straightforward you are.</font>

548
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, let's meet there.</font>

549
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,990
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

550
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,370
<font color="yellow">Will he meet you?</font>

551
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,390
<font color="yellow">We're meeting...</font>

552
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,620
<font color="yellow">at Buyonggak in two hours.</font>

553
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,000
<font color="yellow">Can you persuade Chairman Kim?</font>

554
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,100
<font color="yellow">You two were never on good terms since National Assembly days.</font>

555
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,920
<font color="yellow">This is possible because he's my enemy.</font>

556
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,860
<font color="yellow">I know what he likes.</font>

557
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,490
<font color="yellow">I know everything from his taste to his likes and dislikes.</font>

558
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,390
<font color="yellow">Whatever we do, we have to stop the independent prosecutor from arising.</font>

559
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,290
<font color="yellow">Please, Mr Hwang.</font>

560
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,030
<font color="yellow">I have to stop him before he meets with the president.</font>

561
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,090
<font color="yellow">Tonight is...</font>

562
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,720
<font color="yellow">our final chance.</font>

563
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,760
<font color="yellow">This is it, Father.</font>

564
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,790
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

565
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,560
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

566
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,590
<font color="yellow">Chairman said he had to go to the Blue House early in the morning,</font>

567
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,120
<font color="yellow">so he asked me to go instead.</font>

568
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,760
<font color="yellow">Have a seat. We've already ordered.</font>

569
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,820
<font color="yellow">The independent prosecutor will be appointed as scheduled,</font>

570
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,920
<font color="yellow">and someone from our side will be appointed.</font>

571
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,030
<font color="yellow">After this,</font>

572
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,690
<font color="yellow">Il Jae will receive a sentence of imprisonment.</font>

573
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,760
<font color="yellow">The problem comes after.</font>

574
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,290
<font color="yellow">What I want is...</font>

575
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,220
<font color="yellow">to completely ostracise Il Jae from this society.</font>

576
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,560
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gi Tan.</font>

577
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,190
<font color="yellow">I've been giving it a thought on...</font>

578
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,460
<font color="yellow">why you couldn't just abandon him.</font>

579
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,360
<font color="yellow">Maybe...</font>

580
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,390
<font color="yellow">my aunt's death...</font>

581
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,890
<font color="yellow">has something to do with Congresswoman Hwang.</font>

582
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,760
<font color="yellow">I thought that could be the one weakness Il Jae knows about you.</font>

583
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,620
<font color="yellow">Stop speaking nonsense.</font>

584
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,650
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

585
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,660
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

586
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,030
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

587
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,030
<font color="yellow">are you here instead of Chairman Kim?</font>

588
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,790
<font color="yellow">If you abandon Il Jae,</font>

589
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,290
<font color="yellow">I will help you...</font>

590
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,620
<font color="yellow">with your presidential election.</font>

591
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,820
<font color="yellow">I have nothing against you.</font>

592
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,990
<font color="yellow">But if we fight because of Il Jae,</font>

593
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,190
<font color="yellow">that will leave us both with great wounds.</font>

594
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,790
<font color="yellow">What you're saying is...</font>

595
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,460
<font color="yellow">that you'll pay me...</font>

596
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,120
<font color="yellow">to control me around.</font>

597
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,630
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mr Kang.</font>

598
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,660
<font color="yellow">I'm the person holding the sword, not the sword itself.</font>

599
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,360
<font color="yellow">If you can offer yourself as a sword,</font>

600
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,720
<font color="yellow">I don't think anyone would decline.</font>

601
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,490
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

602
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,660
<font color="yellow">if you want to be my sword,</font>

603
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,190
<font color="yellow">you first...</font>

604
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,290
<font color="yellow">have to let go of Il Jae.</font>

605
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:38,190
<font color="yellow">You'd have to deal with me after you get rid of him, anyways.</font>

606
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,030
<font color="yellow">Once I have...</font>

607
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,090
<font color="yellow">the presidency,</font>

608
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,220
<font color="yellow">what will happen to you?</font>

609
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,490
<font color="yellow">Revenge will only bring another revenge.</font>

610
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,390
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

611
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,390
<font color="yellow">the revenge I have in mind is...</font>

612
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,690
<font color="yellow">something beyond anything you can imagine.</font>

613
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,620
<font color="yellow">So you should just...</font>

614
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,290
<font color="yellow">stop here.</font>

615
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,490
<font color="yellow">We're beating around the bush.</font>

616
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,560
<font color="yellow">I don't care if I'm the sword. My opponent won't change.</font>

617
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,990
<font color="yellow">I just hope...</font>

618
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,360
<font color="yellow">you won't get hurt by the tip of the sword.</font>

619
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,360
<font color="yellow">Father, will the independent prosecutor act really be effective?</font>

620
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,290
<font color="yellow">I'll hold a press conference tomorrow.</font>

621
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,590
<font color="yellow">Call the press.</font>

622
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,620
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

623
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,640
<font color="yellow">From what I heard,</font>

624
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,860
<font color="yellow">Jae Man and Il Jae are as good as over.</font>

625
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,030
<font color="yellow">I guess blood is thicker than water.</font>

626
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

627
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,030
<font color="yellow">what you said to Jae Man...</font>

628
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,720
<font color="yellow">about abandoning Il Jae...</font>

629
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,820
<font color="yellow">Were you really going to help his presidential election?</font>

630
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,590
<font color="yellow">The wrong president will bring the country down.</font>

631
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,920
<font color="yellow">Getting my revenge is important,</font>

632
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,290
<font color="yellow">but I will never help anyone like him.</font>

633
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,260
<font color="yellow">You're a patriot.</font>

634
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,960
<font color="yellow">A special inspection was requested.</font>

635
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,190
<font color="yellow">I, Hwang Jae Man,</font>

636
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,360
<font color="yellow">strongly support the need for an investigation...</font>

637
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,960
<font color="yellow">to find out if Mayor Byun Il Jae really did...</font>

638
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,360
<font color="yellow">violate any election laws.</font>

639
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,090
<font color="yellow">Do you believe he's innocent?</font>

640
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,290
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do.</font>

641
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,190
<font color="yellow">Why did you arrange this press conference?</font>

642
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,160
<font color="yellow">If he is to lead Seoul Metropolitan City,</font>

643
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,690
<font color="yellow">I believe that...</font>

644
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,960
<font color="yellow">he must be cleared of all suspicions and doubts.</font>

645
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:06,690
<font color="yellow">This is what my son-in-law, Byun Il Jae, wants.</font>

646
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,960
<font color="yellow">He can't divert the current, so he's floating a boat.</font>

647
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,860
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang's onboard now.</font>

648
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,260
<font color="yellow">We can sink them both.</font>

649
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,320
<font color="yellow">Now that he got involved,</font>

650
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,260
<font color="yellow">it'll be more than just a raft.</font>

651
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,890
<font color="yellow">Is Lawyer Oh going to be named the lead investigator today?</font>

652
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,320
<font color="yellow">She'll be at the Blue House now.</font>

653
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,490
<font color="yellow">The president will give her the certificate.</font>

654
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,190
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh is the special investigator?</font>

655
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,160
<font color="yellow">The Bar Association must have recommended her.</font>

656
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,790
<font color="yellow">I think Lawyer Min's behind it.</font>

657
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,890
<font color="yellow">Their witnesses will be Cho Cham...</font>

658
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,790
<font color="yellow">and the antique dealer.</font>

659
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,490
<font color="yellow">How did Gi Tan...</font>

660
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,420
<font color="yellow">get his hands on the recording?</font>

661
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,890
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

662
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,260
<font color="yellow">there's a spy?</font>

663
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,290
<font color="yellow">Huaping...</font>

664
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,590
<font color="yellow">had all sorts of listening devices we'd never seen before.</font>

665
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,290
<font color="yellow">I should have been more careful. This is my fault.</font>

666
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,690
<font color="yellow">Apologising won't change anything.</font>

667
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,190
<font color="yellow">Why did you even start what you couldn't handle...</font>

668
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,290
<font color="yellow">It was my call.</font>

669
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,390
<font color="yellow">Don't take it out on her.</font>

670
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,090
<font color="yellow">Call me as your witness.</font>

671
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,890
<font color="yellow">Would you really do that?</font>

672
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,520
<font color="yellow">That won't be necessary.</font>

673
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,370
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

674
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,260
<font color="yellow">If I say Gi Tan bribed me into helping him,</font>

675
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,490
<font color="yellow">you won't need any more witnesses.</font>

676
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,890
<font color="yellow">We need to find a way to silence Cho Cham.</font>

677
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,580
<font color="yellow">The problem is that we can't.</font>

678
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,490
<font color="yellow">If all else fails, we can get rid of him.</font>

679
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,060
<font color="yellow">Don't say something like that.</font>

680
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,260
<font color="yellow">It just came out. I'm frustrated, that's all.</font>

681
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,840
<font color="yellow">Don't say what you don't mean.</font>

682
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,090
<font color="yellow">You'll become mayor once this is all over.</font>

683
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:21,990
<font color="yellow">If you take the stand, it could backfire.</font>

684
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,090
<font color="yellow">Don't give a statement.</font>

685
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,060
<font color="yellow">Who will defend me?</font>

686
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,160
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Nam Ji Cheol, a previous High Court judge.</font>

687
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,520
<font color="yellow">Set up a meeting right away.</font>

688
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,990
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

689
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,790
<font color="yellow">She volunteered to be a witness.</font>

690
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:48,990
<font color="yellow">Why did you refuse?</font>

691
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,690
<font color="yellow">Out of concern.</font>

692
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,590
<font color="yellow">You can't worry about her when you're in this mess.</font>

693
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,890
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about the trial, not about her.</font>

694
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,120
<font color="yellow">I don't trust her.</font>

695
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,890
<font color="yellow">If she takes the stand...</font>

696
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:06,790
<font color="yellow">and betrays me, then I will definitely go down.</font>

697
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,220
<font color="yellow">I thought you were defending her.</font>

698
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,090
<font color="yellow">We need to silence Cho Cham.</font>

699
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,690
<font color="yellow">The whole trial hinges on that.</font>

700
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,290
<font color="yellow">(Ok Chae Ryung)</font>

701
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,990
<font color="yellow">You meet with Lawyer Nam for me.</font>

702
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,490
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

703
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,350
<font color="yellow">Who called you?</font>

704
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,490
<font color="yellow">I'll explain later. Get going.</font>

705

<font color="yellow">(Ok Chae Ryung)</font>

706
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:55,760
<font color="yellow">What you said earlier. It didn't sound like a joke.</font>

707
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,160
<font color="yellow">That is the only option...</font>

708
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:00,960
<font color="yellow">we have.</font>

709
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,860
<font color="yellow">We must kill him.</font>

710
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,490
<font color="yellow">He's in a cell. It won't be easy.</font>

711
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,890
<font color="yellow">Insulin shots.</font>

712
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,990
<font color="yellow">Insulin?</font>

713
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,190
<font color="yellow">Cho Cham has diabetes.</font>

714
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,470
<font color="yellow">If he's injected with...</font>

715
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,590
<font color="yellow">potassium chloride instead of insulin,</font>

716
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,760
<font color="yellow">his heart will go into overdrive.</font>

717
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,620
<font color="yellow">It's a perfect crime.</font>

718
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:37,990
<font color="yellow">You found a way out of this trial.</font>

719
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:43,690
<font color="yellow">I wish you victory.</font>

720
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,690
<font color="yellow">Il Jae is going further and further.</font>

721
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,780
<font color="yellow">He's trying to kill a witness, too?</font>

722
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,960
<font color="yellow">You have to protect him.</font>

723
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,390
<font color="yellow">We can do that.</font>

724
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:04,490
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Chae Ryung.</font>

725
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,290
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon.</font>

726
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,690
<font color="yellow">During the trial,</font>

727
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,090
<font color="yellow">put me on the stand as your witness.</font>

<font color="yellow">If I give a statement,</font>

730
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,960
<font color="yellow">you will definitely win.</font>

731
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,230
<font color="yellow">That means you'd have to admit to criminal activity.</font>

732
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,230
<font color="yellow">I'll go to prison and do time.</font>

733
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,620
<font color="yellow">That doesn't scare me.</font>

734
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,090
<font color="yellow">If Huaping finds out you're alive, your life will be in danger...</font>

736
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,790
<font color="yellow">This is a chance...</font>

737
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,120
<font color="yellow">to clear my name.</font>

738
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,980
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

739
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,590
<font color="yellow">Il Jae took the MK2 vaccine.</font>

740
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,890
<font color="yellow">If my statement helps cancel his election,</font>

741
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,390
<font color="yellow">nothing would please the Huaping more.</font>

742
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,960
<font color="yellow">What if they don't forgive you?</font>

743
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,590
<font color="yellow">I'll accept my fate.</font>

744
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:54,160
<font color="yellow">I can't spend the rest of my life a fugitive.</font>

745
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,520
<font color="yellow">I know my boss.</font>

746
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:00,990
<font color="yellow">Trust me. Put me on the stand.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Prison)</font>

748
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,100
<font color="yellow">Once a day, the prison doctor...</font>

749
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,390
<font color="yellow">will administer the insulin shot.</font>

750
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,520
<font color="yellow">I told the doctor to be careful, so they won't be able...</font>

751
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,290
<font color="yellow">to switch the syringes that easily.</font>

752
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,490
<font color="yellow">When he isn't with the doctor,</font>

753
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,690
<font color="yellow">the prison guards will watch him around the clock.</font>

754
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,250
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

755
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,760
<font color="yellow">I explained it all to the witness and told him to be wary.</font>

756

<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry.</font>

757
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,120
<font color="yellow">If they're caught switching the syringes before the trial,</font>

758
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,030
<font color="yellow">we can add attempted murder to Il Jae's list of charges.</font>

759
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,390
<font color="yellow">You're very thorough.</font>

760
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,860
<font color="yellow">You're a great partner.</font>

761

<font color="yellow">Sorry, but I have to meet a client.</font>

767
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,490
<font color="yellow">Why are you lying?</font>

768
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,860
<font color="yellow">You were on the phone saying you'd go straight home.</font>

769
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,120
<font color="yellow">I'll be honest, then.</font>

770
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,120
<font color="yellow">Joining you for a meal would make me feel uncomfortable.</font>

771
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,190
<font color="yellow">Would the reason for that...</font>

772

<font color="yellow">be Do Gun Woo?</font>

<font color="yellow">If so, then I really can't give in.</font>

774

<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

776
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,890
<font color="yellow">- As a witness at the trial...
-  Is Gun Woo very jealous?</font>

777
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:08,390
<font color="yellow">Please don't ask personal questions.</font>

778
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,890
<font color="yellow">- I won't.
-  At the trial,</font>

779
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,760
<font color="yellow">we'll add one more witness that Il Jae won't even expect.</font>

780
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,220
<font color="yellow">Someone to incriminate him.</font>

781
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,890
<font color="yellow">That's our hidden card.</font>

782
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:23,590
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

783
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:36,220
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung will be our witness?</font>

784
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,320
<font color="yellow">I need you to keep it from the chairman until the trial.</font>

785
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,790
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung's...</font>

786
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,790
<font color="yellow">working for Il Jae as our spy.</font>

787
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,290
<font color="yellow">Then this whole corruption case...</font>

788
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,520
<font color="yellow">It was her design.</font>

789
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:58,790
<font color="yellow">You and the chairman cut and sewed along the lines.</font>

790
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,890
<font color="yellow">Thanks to her,</font>

791
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,060
<font color="yellow">we have a prison uniform...</font>

792
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,390
<font color="yellow">that will fit Il Jae perfectly.</font>

793
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,690
<font color="yellow">Who's that hidden card?</font>

794
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,890
<font color="yellow">The witness asked to remain unknown until the day of the trial.</font>

795
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,860
<font color="yellow">I can't say any more.</font>

796
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,790
<font color="yellow">We're on the same side.</font>

797
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,360
<font color="yellow">I'm a lawyer and a specially appointed investigator.</font>

798
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,790
<font color="yellow">I have to protect the witnesses.</font>

799
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,790
<font color="yellow">Now, I'm too curious to eat.</font>

800
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,690
<font color="yellow">I love meat.</font>

801
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,090
<font color="yellow">You're pretty when you smile.</font>

802
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:47,910
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  It's not a personal question.</font>

803
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,060
<font color="yellow">Can I say how I feel?</font>

804
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,990
<font color="yellow">Your smile makes me feel better.</font>

805
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,090
<font color="yellow">I'd like to see it more often.</font>

806
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,360
<font color="yellow">Is that too rude?</font>

807
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,690
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

808
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,890
<font color="yellow">I guess it was.</font>

809
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,190
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you a drink.</font>

810
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,060
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I was rude.</font>

811
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,390
<font color="yellow">I'll buy a drink to apologise.</font>

812
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,390
<font color="yellow">I know I make you feel uncomfortable.</font>

813
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,390
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to get close to you, so don't shoot me down yet.</font>

814
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,990
<font color="yellow">He's with her again.</font>

815
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,070
<font color="yellow">Have you ever seen him smile like that?</font>

816
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,090
<font color="yellow">Never.</font>

817
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,060
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

818
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,820
<font color="yellow">they're dating?</font>

819
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,560
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling me?</font>

820
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,190
<font color="yellow">Explain why Soo Yeon is having dinner with Gi Tan.</font>

821
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,190
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me that?</font>

822
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,820
<font color="yellow">You and she have sort of a relationship.</font>

823
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,170
<font color="yellow">Did you know they were meeting often?</font>

824
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,290
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

825
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,620
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

826
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,390
<font color="yellow">They're discussing business, so don't get involved.</font>

827
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,560
<font color="yellow">Why would they be smiling while discussing business?</font>

828
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,120
<font color="yellow">I'm too busy to talk about this.</font>

829
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,360
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

830
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,990
<font color="yellow">You avoided me when I invited you out for dinner.</font>

831
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,600
<font color="yellow">Now, you're too busy grinning to eat.</font>

832
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,660
<font color="yellow">It's a post-meeting dinner.</font>

833
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,870
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it.</font>

834
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:47,890
<font color="yellow">A meeting?</font>

835
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,360
<font color="yellow">I should go.</font>

836
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:52,690
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

837
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,520
<font color="yellow">I have a trial to prepare for.</font>

838
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,290
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the meal. The next one's on me.</font>

839
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,370
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

840
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,260
<font color="yellow">- You can't go.
-  Let go.</font>

841
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,160
<font color="yellow">Let's have a meeting. Right now.</font>

842
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,340
<font color="yellow">Shin Young.</font>

843
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,120
<font color="yellow">We're business partners.</font>

844
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,390
<font color="yellow">Let's have a meeting.</font>

845
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,290
<font color="yellow">Then we can eat.</font>

846
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:20,260
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to kill Cho Cham?</font>

847
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,590
<font color="yellow">No fool...</font>

848
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,690
<font color="yellow">would kill a witness right before a trial.</font>

849
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,820
<font color="yellow">Then why...</font>

850
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:31,390
<font color="yellow">I gave Chae Ryung false information.</font>

851
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,660
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

852
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:37,520
<font color="yellow">make noise in the east and then attack from the west.</font>

853
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,090
<font color="yellow">While Gi Tan is obsessing over the syringe,</font>

854
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,820
<font color="yellow">I need you to travel to the US.</font>

855
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:50,670
<font color="yellow">What for, Sir?</font>

856
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:53,120
<font color="yellow">Just do as I tell you.</font>

857
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,690
<font color="yellow">Then I'll come out of the trial...</font>

858
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,860
<font color="yellow">an innocent man.</font>

859
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,820
<font color="yellow">Ms Ok.</font>

860
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,280
<font color="yellow">Do you have some free time?</font>

861
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,960
<font color="yellow">I was about to go to the office.</font>

862
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,100
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

863
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,690
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the hospital...</font>

864
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,290
<font color="yellow">and there's no one to drive me.</font>

865
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,190
<font color="yellow">I will drive you.</font>

866
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,620
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling unwell?</font>

867
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,590
<font color="yellow">Anyone my age...</font>

868
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,690
<font color="yellow">is bound to have a few kinks in the machinery.</font>

869
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:43,490
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. I still think you could take down an ox.</font>

870
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,020
<font color="yellow">- Do you?
-  Yes.</font>

871
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,660
<font color="yellow">Your hospital is far from the city centre.</font>

872
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:54,690
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

873
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:58,860
<font color="yellow">I've been seeing the doctor for many years.</font>

874
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,020
<font color="yellow">(Haneul Care Centre)</font>

875
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,950
<font color="yellow">There aren't that many patients.</font>

876
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:19,690
<font color="yellow">It's a care centre that doubles as a hospital.</font>

877
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:23,390
<font color="yellow">Most of the patients are seriously ill.</font>

878
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:27,140
<font color="yellow">Why would you need to come here?</font>

879
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,560
<font color="yellow">I'm not the one who will be checking in.</font>

880
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,290
<font color="yellow">I'm here to check you in.</font>

881
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:37,260
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

882
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,290
<font color="yellow">They're ready for her.</font>

883
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:45,490
<font color="yellow">You have been...</font>

884
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,190
<font color="yellow">under a lot of stress trying to help Il Jae.</font>

885
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,590
<font color="yellow">I set a room aside for you.</font>

886
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,060
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang.</font>

887
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:55,760
<font color="yellow">A few days' rest...</font>

888
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,460
<font color="yellow">will make you feel brand new.</font>

889
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,250
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang. Why are you doing this?</font>

890
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,490
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang. Mr Hwang!</font>

891
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,560
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

892
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,260
<font color="yellow">I brought Chae Ryung...</font>

893
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,390
<font color="yellow">to a care centre.</font>

894
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,090
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about her.</font>

895
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,960
<font color="yellow">Prepare for the trial.</font>

896
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,360
<font color="yellow">I will, Sir.</font>

897
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,960
<font color="yellow">The doctor says...</font>

898
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,890
<font color="yellow">you are...</font>

899
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:27,490
<font color="yellow">very weak in body and mind.</font>

900
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:28,520
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

901
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,840
<font color="yellow">illegal confinement.</font>

902
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,960
<font color="yellow">Right here I have...</font>

903
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,260
<font color="yellow">a consent form...</font>

904
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,490
<font color="yellow">with your thumbprint.</font>

905
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,120
<font color="yellow">You will remain here for treatment...</font>

906
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,390
<font color="yellow">according to the centre's rules.</font>

907
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,520
<font color="yellow">Tell me why you're doing this to me.</font>

908
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,120
<font color="yellow">The charges you framed Il Jae with.</font>

909
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,120
<font color="yellow">I know you planned it all.</font>

910
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,390
<font color="yellow">Il Jae will go down if you so much as take the stand.</font>

911
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,060
<font color="yellow">I can't leave a bomb out in the open.</font>

912
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:06,090
<font color="yellow">What will you do to me?</font>

913
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,160
<font color="yellow">Kill me?</font>

914
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,690
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

915
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,460
<font color="yellow">I'm not like Il Jae.</font>

916
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,020
<font color="yellow">I won't break the law.</font>

917
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:19,760
<font color="yellow">Even if you sue me once you get out,</font>

918
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:25,020
<font color="yellow">no one can charge me for helping a sick person.</font>

919
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,360
<font color="yellow">Until the trial's over,</font>

920
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,860
<font color="yellow">stay here, get looked after and rest as well.</font>

921
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,390
<font color="yellow">What will happen after the trial?</font>

922
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:42,460
<font color="yellow">That is up to Il Jae.</font>

923
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,560
<font color="yellow">What I did isn't illegal.</font>

924
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,620
<font color="yellow">Sleep well.</font>

925
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,090
<font color="yellow">Is the trial today?</font>

926
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,090
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

927
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,260
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

928
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,520
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

929
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,680
<font color="yellow">I just got a call from the prison.</font>

930
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,460
<font color="yellow">Someone tried to kill our witness.</font>

931
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,520
<font color="yellow">With what?</font>

932
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,520
<font color="yellow">A syringe.</font>

933
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,390
<font color="yellow">It must contain potassium chloride.</font>

934
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,030
<font color="yellow">Have Soo Yeon put him on the stand.</font>

935
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,860
<font color="yellow">Check what was in the syringe.</font>

936
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

937
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:01,890
<font color="yellow">Il Jae did what we expected.</font>

938
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,190
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

939
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,540
<font color="yellow">I got a call from the prison officer...</font>

940
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,390
<font color="yellow">that Soo Yeon has collected the syringe already.</font>

941
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,020
<font color="yellow">Today's trial is going to be quite entertaining.</font>

942
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,020
<font color="yellow">(Court)</font>

943
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,260
<font color="yellow">Will you be claiming innocence?</font>

944
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,960
<font color="yellow">Not only will my innocence be proven today,</font>

945
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,860
<font color="yellow">but I'll reveal all of the crimes made by those trying to frame me.</font>

946
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,420
<font color="yellow">Who are the people trying to frame you?</font>

947
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,760
<font color="yellow">That would be them.</font>

948
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,420
<font color="yellow">What do you think about Mayor Byun's comment?</font>

949
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,690
<font color="yellow">It's a false accusation. You should charge him for defamation.</font>

950
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,360
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh...</font>

951
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:21,420
<font color="yellow">is telling me to sue you.</font>

952
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,890
<font color="yellow">I guess you'll have one more offence...</font>

953
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,390
<font color="yellow">to go on your list.</font>

954
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,320
<font color="yellow">(Monster)</font>

955
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:04,340
<font color="yellow">We must save them.</font>

956
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,890
<font color="yellow">That's the only way we can stop Mayor Byun.</font>

957
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:09,160
<font color="yellow">It'll be over if he finds even the slightest weakness.</font>

958
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,490
<font color="yellow">I'm the chairwoman!</font>

959
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,490
<font color="yellow">Don't call me Mrs Hwang!</font>

960
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:16,120
<font color="yellow">Just watch and see...</font>

961
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,840
<font color="yellow">how evil I can get.</font>

962
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,120
<font color="yellow">You'll find out how stupid...</font>

963
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,120
<font color="yellow">your decision was.</font>

964
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,480
<font color="yellow">Your Honour.</font>

965
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,290
<font color="yellow">I would like to call out another witness.</font>
