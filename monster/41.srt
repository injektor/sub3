<font color="yellow">It seems like the tofu has gone bad.</font>

136

147
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,019
<font color="yellow">it always happens with the person you trust the most.</font>

<font color="yellow">you can't convict me on the same charges.</font>

156
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,189
<font color="yellow">What will you put me in jail for next time?</font>

157
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:44,849
<font color="yellow">That's not what's important.</font>

158
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:47,349
<font color="yellow">What's important is, when will you be released...</font>

159
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:49,149
<font color="yellow">next time, if at all?</font>

160
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:52,689
<font color="yellow">You won't ever get to taste tofu for your release again.</font>

161
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:57,519
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure you rot in prison for the rest of your life.</font>

162
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:59,519
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh.</font>

163
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:03,789
<font color="yellow">Do you know what the biggest ordeal from the Pandora's box was?</font>

164
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,389
<font color="yellow">It's the one that came out last. Hope.</font>

165
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,789
<font color="yellow">Because of hope,</font>

166
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,489
<font color="yellow">a whole new struggle begins.</font>

167
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,449
<font color="yellow">You should rid yourself of any useless hopes.</font>

168
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:18,919
<font color="yellow">You better...</font>

169
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,849
<font color="yellow">mark those words.</font>

170
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,319
<font color="yellow">Because the days when you struggle from hope...</font>

171
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,059
<font color="yellow">will be upon you soon.</font>

172
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:34,519
<font color="yellow">The taxis don't come around here much.</font>

173
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,319
<font color="yellow">You have to go down that hill for the bus station.</font>

174
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:39,789
<font color="yellow">You know how much buses cost, right?</font>

175
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,749
<font color="yellow">We'll be late for our visit. Let's go.</font>

176
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,349
<font color="yellow">Okay, we should go.</font>

177
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:48,519
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You don't have a single person to pick you up. How sad.</font>

178
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:22,219
<font color="yellow">I'll decline this visit. Please cancel it.</font>

179
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,489
<font color="yellow">Officer Kim, how is your baby?</font>

180
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,449
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but could you let him stay here...</font>

181
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:30,849
<font color="yellow">for the visitation hour?</font>

182
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:33,289
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir. Hey, 2757.</font>

183
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:48,819
<font color="yellow">I won't be opening my mouth until the time's up.</font>

184
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,519
<font color="yellow">Then I'll just ask questions.</font>

185
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,689
<font color="yellow">Did you kill my brother?</font>

186
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,489
<font color="yellow">Or did Il Jae murder him...</font>

187
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,319
<font color="yellow">with his own hands?</font>

188
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,889
<font color="yellow">How many did you kill aside from Dong Soo?</font>

189
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,149
<font color="yellow">Two? Three?</font>

190
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,989
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

191
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:15,749
<font color="yellow">I thought you weren't going to talk. Why are you yelling?</font>

192
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,989
<font color="yellow">You killed Gi Tan's parents, too. Am I right?</font>

193
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,789
<font color="yellow">Did you kill Su Do Hospital's Dr Jung Man Ok, too?</font>

194
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:23,189
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me!</font>

195
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,149
<font color="yellow">Then I guess it was Il Jae.</font>

196
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,449
<font color="yellow">Yap all you want.</font>

197
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:36,519
<font color="yellow">Officer Kim.</font>

198
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,949
<font color="yellow">You're recording this, right?</font>

199
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,219
<font color="yellow">Make sure you write down "Yap all you want."</font>

200
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:43,689
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lawyer Min.</font>

201
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:45,219
<font color="yellow">Oh Choong Dong.</font>

202
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:48,519
<font color="yellow">When we reveal the truth,</font>

203
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,149
<font color="yellow">Il Jae will blame you for everything.</font>

204
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:57,619
<font color="yellow">Just to remind you, our country still has the death penalty.</font>

205
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,949
<font color="yellow">While you keep your mouth shut for loyalty,</font>

206
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:03,819
<font color="yellow">there is a rope...</font>

207
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,289
<font color="yellow">dropping down to your neck.</font>

208
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:08,149
<font color="yellow">Remember that.</font>

209
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,319
<font color="yellow">I was released on probation thanks to you.</font>

210
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:23,419
<font color="yellow">You got rid of all the evidence for me.</font>

211
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,249
<font color="yellow">Why do you think they're all gone?</font>

212
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:29,749
<font color="yellow">I still have a photocopy.</font>

213
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:36,289
<font color="yellow">If you plan on putting Gi Tan and I into a fight...</font>

214
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,419
<font color="yellow">while you snatch away Dodo Group,</font>

215
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,819
<font color="yellow">forget about it now.</font>

216
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,489
<font color="yellow">I was about to reach out my hand to you.</font>

217
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:52,449
<font color="yellow">If anything, I'm the one reaching out.</font>

218
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:55,589
<font color="yellow">You'll have to accept it if I do.</font>

219
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,419
<font color="yellow">What if I decline?</font>

220
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:02,089
<font color="yellow">I saw that you swindled a lot of funds through a paper company.</font>

221
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,389
<font color="yellow">If I report it to the National Tax Service,</font>

222
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,919
<font color="yellow">you'll have to give back all of that money.</font>

223
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,389
<font color="yellow">Divorced and penniless?</font>

224
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,019
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be very difficult for you to get back on your feet.</font>

225
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,349
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want?</font>

226
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,619
<font color="yellow">Make your Z Capital account in Hong Kong...</font>

227
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,349
<font color="yellow">a joint account with me.</font>

228
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:35,219
<font color="yellow">Do you want...</font>

229
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:37,419
<font color="yellow">a portion of my money?</font>

230
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:40,119
<font color="yellow">No, I don't care for your money.</font>

231
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:44,319
<font color="yellow">But I want to make a deal so that you can't use any of your money...</font>

232
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,949
<font color="yellow">without my permission.</font>

233
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:48,749
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to tie me down...</font>

234
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,119
<font color="yellow">with a joint contract?</font>

235
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,549
<font color="yellow">You do not trust me and I do not trust you.</font>

236
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,489
<font color="yellow">I think I need that much restraint...</font>

237
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,749
<font color="yellow">for us to work together.</font>

238
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,589
<font color="yellow">I have evidence...</font>

239
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:03,419
<font color="yellow">of your corruption, too.</font>

240
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:06,589
<font color="yellow">You can make that public.</font>

241
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,149
<font color="yellow">I came to Korea empty-handed.</font>

242
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:10,889
<font color="yellow">I don't mind leaving here...</font>

243
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:12,789
<font color="yellow">empty-handed again.</font>

244
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:31,949
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

245
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,619
<font color="yellow">Welcome home, Il Jae.</font>

246
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,019
<font color="yellow">If I knew no one was picking you up,</font>

247
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,649
<font color="yellow">I would've went out myself.</font>

248
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,349
<font color="yellow">I felt very sorry...</font>

249
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,289
<font color="yellow">for those who had...</font>

250
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,449
<font color="yellow">no one to greet them.</font>

251
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,549
<font color="yellow">Where's your father?</font>

252
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:52,989
<font color="yellow">He has a dinner appointment. He'll be late.</font>

253
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:03,189
<font color="yellow">My goodness, I thought things were promising when he got elected,</font>

254
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:07,489
<font color="yellow">but it was a matter of seconds before he became a trainwreck.</font>

255
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:08,649
<font color="yellow">We aren't the ones to talk.</font>

256
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:11,249
<font color="yellow">We're living off of someone else, too.</font>

257
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:13,819
<font color="yellow">I have things in mind, Mum.</font>

258
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,389
<font color="yellow">Just wait a little more.</font>

259
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:17,119
<font color="yellow">I can't let this be.</font>

260
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,719
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling?</font>

261
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:23,549
<font color="yellow">I'm telling Shin Young that your father has dementia.</font>

262
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,149
<font color="yellow">No, Mum.</font>

263
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:28,519
<font color="yellow">Give that to me. Don't tell her.</font>

264
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,719
<font color="yellow">The least she can do is stop him from doing weird things.</font>

265
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:36,389
<font color="yellow">He's completely smitten with Gun Woo right now.</font>

266
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:38,189
<font color="yellow">If she becomes a trouble for Father,</font>

267
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:41,219
<font color="yellow">that's the end of you and me as I know it.</font>

268
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:44,819
<font color="yellow">Are you going to sit around and watch Gun Woo take his assets?</font>

269
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,689
<font color="yellow">I recently filed a form to declare Father...</font>

270
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,489
<font color="yellow">incompetent...</font>

271
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:51,219
<font color="yellow">to the domestic affairs court.</font>

272
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:53,349
<font color="yellow">Didn't you think I knew about that?</font>

273
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:56,589
<font color="yellow">It takes months before that gets processed.</font>

274
00:16:56,719 --> 00:17:00,119
<font color="yellow">If he finishes his will before that, everything is over.</font>

275
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,489
<font color="yellow">Mum, sometimes you seem very narrow-minded.</font>

276
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,119
<font color="yellow">We can ask Uncle to process it.</font>

277
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,219
<font color="yellow">Come on, you should make use of your great connections.</font>

278
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:13,649
<font color="yellow">That's a way.</font>

279
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:17,319
<font color="yellow">If the court processes it...</font>

280
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:19,349
<font color="yellow">without extra procedures,</font>

281
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,649
<font color="yellow">a doctor will be...</font>

282
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,119
<font color="yellow">dispatched to examine him...</font>

283
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,589
<font color="yellow">within a few days.</font>

284
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,049
<font color="yellow">If he's declared...</font>

285
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,389
<font color="yellow">incompetent at that time,</font>

286
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:31,289
<font color="yellow">he will no longer be able to edit his will.</font>

287
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,189
<font color="yellow">You're so smart, my son.</font>

288
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:41,419
<font color="yellow">You should've started thinking like that sooner.</font>

289
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:45,219
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

290
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:49,819
<font color="yellow">It's not too great to use your brain continuously.</font>

291
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,759
<font color="yellow">You have to use it when you really need to.</font>

292
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,419
<font color="yellow">Honey, we're still lawfully married.</font>

293
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,519
<font color="yellow">You can stay here until the process is through.</font>

294
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,789
<font color="yellow">Your father...</font>

295
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,919
<font color="yellow">probably wants me to leave as soon as I can.</font>

296
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,949
<font color="yellow">Honey, are you disappointed in me, too?</font>

297
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,219
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

298
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:24,189
<font color="yellow">You aren't really leaving me forever, are you?</font>

299
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,489
<font color="yellow">We can get married again after the election.</font>

300
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:33,259
<font color="yellow">That's what Father promised me.</font>

301
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,389
<font color="yellow">We can do that if he doesn't get elected.</font>

302
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,319
<font color="yellow">But if he does get elected,</font>

303
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,919
<font color="yellow">we can never be together.</font>

304
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:45,049
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo.</font>

305
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,519
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to part with me,</font>

306
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,719
<font color="yellow">you must be completely on my side.</font>

307
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,519
<font color="yellow">What is that like?</font>

308
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,759
<font color="yellow">Think the way I want you to think...</font>

309
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:58,259
<font color="yellow">and move the way I want you to move.</font>

310
00:18:58,849 --> 00:18:59,849
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

311
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,519
<font color="yellow">holding a grudge...</font>

312
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:03,759
<font color="yellow">against Father?</font>

313
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:05,889
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

314
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,759
<font color="yellow">I will make sure...</font>

315
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,219
<font color="yellow">that I make Mr Hwang the president.</font>

316
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,449
<font color="yellow">After that,</font>

317
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,189
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure that he can never abandon me.</font>

318
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:21,619
<font color="yellow">You must help me...</font>

319
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:24,049
<font color="yellow">for that to happen.</font>

320
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,889
<font color="yellow">Do not doubt anything I do.</font>

321
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,619
<font color="yellow">Help me blindly.</font>

322
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:31,919
<font color="yellow">There is no one else who's more precious to me than you.</font>

323
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,649
<font color="yellow">Me too, Ji Soo.</font>

324
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,649
<font color="yellow">That's why I need your help.</font>

325
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,719
<font color="yellow">We can't be separated.</font>

326
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,449
<font color="yellow">These are the lists of people who hold matured bonds for Dodo Group.</font>

327
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:06,319
<font color="yellow">This man named So Gil Du holds a huge amount of bonds.</font>

328
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:07,519
<font color="yellow">In other words,</font>

329
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,589
<font color="yellow">he has half the lifeline of Dodo Group.</font>

330
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,219
<font color="yellow">You should meet this man.</font>

331
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:15,219
<font color="yellow">He probably won't see me.</font>

332
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,419
<font color="yellow">You should go yourself.</font>

333
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:19,649
<font color="yellow">Is he very particular about things?</font>

334
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,589
<font color="yellow">Not only is he particular, but he's also odd and ill-tempered.</font>

335
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:25,719
<font color="yellow">Let's go and meet him now.</font>

336
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:27,789
<font color="yellow">I'll make a call.</font>

337
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:38,649
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who called.</font>

338
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,319
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

339
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:44,689
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

340
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,619
<font color="yellow">Your guests are here.</font>

341
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:00,519
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

342
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,549
<font color="yellow">I am Kang Gi Tan of KT Corporation.</font>

343
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,819
<font color="yellow">What does this KT Corporation...</font>

344
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:08,589
<font color="yellow">or whatever it is do?</font>

345
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,349
<font color="yellow">It's an investment company.</font>

346
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,089
<font color="yellow">An investment.</font>

347
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,289
<font color="yellow">That's a perfect business to draw frauds.</font>

348
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:20,819
<font color="yellow">Sir, I came to ask you for a favour.</font>

349
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,219
<font color="yellow">You don't even know me.</font>

350
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,189
<font color="yellow">How can you ask me for a favour?</font>

351
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:26,289
<font color="yellow">I'm sure...</font>

352
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:30,149
<font color="yellow">you will be interested in this business plan as well.</font>

353
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,389
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

354
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,719
<font color="yellow">I want to buy out your matured bonds...</font>

355
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,319
<font color="yellow">for Dodo Group.</font>

356
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:47,089
<font color="yellow">What will you do with it?</font>

357
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,759
<font color="yellow">I plan to take over Dodo Group.</font>

358
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,089
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

359
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,549
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

360
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,619
<font color="yellow">you are corporate hunters.</font>

361
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,119
<font color="yellow">We're a legal investment company.</font>

362
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:59,419
<font color="yellow">You can do a quick search to find out more about us.</font>

363
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:01,889
<font color="yellow">When farmers use traps instead of sickles,</font>

364
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,689
<font color="yellow">they become hunters.</font>

365
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,849
<font color="yellow">Hunting or farming, if you sell your bonds to me,</font>

366
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:08,849
<font color="yellow">you won't suffer any losses.</font>

367
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:09,919
<font color="yellow">Do Chi.</font>

368
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:12,819
<font color="yellow">Get rid of these men and sprinkle some salt.</font>

369
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,049
<font color="yellow">And make that organic.</font>

370
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:16,289
<font color="yellow">You should at least hear our...</font>

371
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:17,289
<font color="yellow">I've been...</font>

372
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,949
<font color="yellow">dealing with money in this business for 30 years.</font>

373
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:23,789
<font color="yellow">I can tell very quickly if it's clean money...</font>

374
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:25,149
<font color="yellow">or corrupt money.</font>

375
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:26,419
<font color="yellow">A business plan?</font>

376
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:28,489
<font color="yellow">You're trying to buy out...</font>

377
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,419
<font color="yellow">a perfectly good company and sell it off in little pieces.</font>

378
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:32,749
<font color="yellow">I see right through you.</font>

379
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:35,519
<font color="yellow">- Sir. - I'm not your sir.</font>

380
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,719
<font color="yellow">You don't even know me.</font>

381
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,889
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Kick them out right now.</font>

382
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,319
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

383
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,089
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

384
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,319
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

385
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:57,749
<font color="yellow">How dare you throw salt at us?</font>

386
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:59,719
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare come back to visit him.</font>

387
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,419
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

388
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,849
<font color="yellow">I should've researched for more information about him.</font>

389
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:12,889
<font color="yellow">Even if you did, the result would've been the same.</font>

390
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,749
<font color="yellow">Why don't you buy out other people's bonds?</font>

391
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:18,689
<font color="yellow">You can't take over Dodo Group with that.</font>

392
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:20,489
<font color="yellow">So Gil Du.</font>

393
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:23,589
<font color="yellow">We must persuade him.</font>

394
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:27,519
<font color="yellow">I will look for more information about him.</font>

395
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,149
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan is utterly mistaken.</font>

396
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:45,149
<font color="yellow">So Gil Du is a tough man.</font>

397
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,849
<font color="yellow">He won't move with such a visit.</font>

398
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,589
<font color="yellow">Is he that powerful?</font>

399
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:53,189
<font color="yellow">Not only does he hold a lot of bonds,</font>

400
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:55,949
<font color="yellow">he is a big player in the private loan business.</font>

401
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:59,019
<font color="yellow">I heard he has a huge amount of cash.</font>

402
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:01,589
<font color="yellow">Anyway.</font>

403
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:05,189
<font color="yellow">There are no rich men in this land who never borrowed money from him.</font>

404
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:10,619
<font color="yellow">But he still goes to markets to retrieve daily instalment loans.</font>

405
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,089
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

406
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,819
<font color="yellow">If someone can't pay,</font>

407
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,989
<font color="yellow">he'd at least take what they sell to make up for it.</font>

408
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:17,719
<font color="yellow">He's a cold-blooded man.</font>

409
00:24:18,949 --> 00:24:22,289
<font color="yellow">He's known as Chainsaw So among those merchants.</font>

410
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,249
<font color="yellow">- Chainsaw? - It means he can rip them apart.</font>

411
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:28,919
<font color="yellow">There are many people whose lives were ruined after using his money.</font>

412
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,089
<font color="yellow">What an awful man.</font>

413
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,019
<font color="yellow">He's awfully rich but still takes money from the markets.</font>

414
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:37,849
<font color="yellow">He's really terrible.</font>

415
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:41,189
<font color="yellow">You know Chairman Cho of Namsan Corporation, right?</font>

416
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,889
<font color="yellow">He was bankrupt after turning his claims over.</font>

417
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,089
<font color="yellow">They say, that's also why Chairman Cho committed suicide.</font>

418
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,219
<font color="yellow">What Gi Tan is after are those mature bonds he has.</font>

419
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:56,119
<font color="yellow">He will never sell them.</font>

420
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,749
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

421
00:24:57,749 --> 00:25:01,689
<font color="yellow">He receives interest every month from Dodo Group. Why sell it?</font>

422
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:05,289
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan will do anything for whatever he wants.</font>

423
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,519
<font color="yellow">We never know, so keep an eye on it.</font>

424
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:10,249
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

425
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:15,649
<font color="yellow">Does Chainsaw So have family?</font>

426
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,019
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

427
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,949
<font color="yellow">He lost his wife and daughter in an accident 20 years ago.</font>

428
00:25:20,949 --> 00:25:22,049
<font color="yellow">He's living alone.</font>

429
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:23,249
<font color="yellow">Does he have a hobby?</font>

430
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:25,119
<font color="yellow">He doesn't drink or smoke.</font>

431
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,289
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a girlfriend either.</font>

432
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:29,089
<font color="yellow">His only hobby is playing go.</font>

433
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,249
<font color="yellow">He's a hard one to win over.</font>

434
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:35,089
<font color="yellow">One thing to note...</font>

435
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
<font color="yellow">is that he might have paranoia.</font>

436
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:39,989
<font color="yellow">- Paranoia? - Yes.</font>

437
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:43,449
<font color="yellow">Aside from a few special days, he has the same schedule every day.</font>

438
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:47,449
<font color="yellow">He goes to the same place at the same time every day.</font>

439
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:50,819
<font color="yellow">He can't stand people or things that he's not...</font>

440
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,619
<font color="yellow">familiar with.</font>

441
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,389
<font color="yellow">No wonder he didn't look me in the eyes.</font>

442
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:00,389
<font color="yellow">Study his daily schedule and report back to me.</font>

443
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:01,849
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

444
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:18,549
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Gong.</font>

445
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,589
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo. We're in trouble.</font>

446
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,989
<font color="yellow">The chairman has disappeared.</font>

447
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:24,749
<font color="yellow">What do you mean he disappeared?</font>

448
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,349
<font color="yellow">I thought he was taking a nap, but he's nowhere to be found.</font>

449
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,919
<font color="yellow">Report to the police first.</font>

450
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,319
<font color="yellow">Send out some people to check the places he often goes to.</font>

451
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:36,349
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

452
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:41,119
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

453
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:49,549
<font color="yellow">(Han Sang Goo)</font>

454
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:53,149
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

455
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,119
<font color="yellow">I'm at the office.</font>

456
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,349
<font color="yellow">The chairman has disappeared. Can you go see if...</font>

457
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,189
<font color="yellow">he went to Jae Man's house?</font>

458
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,919
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

459
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,549
<font color="yellow">Jae Man.</font>

460
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:13,149
<font color="yellow">You know the Chief of the Family Court, don't you?</font>

461
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:17,689
<font color="yellow">We have to make sure he's found legally incompetent...</font>

462
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,149
<font color="yellow">before he writes up the will.</font>

463
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,549
<font color="yellow">He just announced his participation in the presidential election.</font>

464
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,619
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to ask him for such a favour?</font>

465
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:29,049
<font color="yellow">It won't be good for you either if we become penniless.</font>

466
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:31,019
<font color="yellow">There's no harm in it for us.</font>

467
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,249
<font color="yellow">It will cost a lot for the campaign. We can help.</font>

468
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:37,519
<font color="yellow">We don't need your help. We have enough money.</font>

469
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,989
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you getting compensation money...</font>

470
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:41,719
<font color="yellow">from your divorce?</font>

471
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:44,089
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why are you bringing that up?</font>

472
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:45,249
<font color="yellow">Stop that.</font>

473
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,989
<font color="yellow">Jae Man.</font>

474
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:52,319
<font color="yellow">Please help us out.</font>

475
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:02,149
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do is here to see you.</font>

476
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,989
<font color="yellow">Why... Why is he here?</font>

477
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:20,549
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here?</font>

478
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,249
<font color="yellow">Honey. How are you feeling?</font>

479
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,149
<font color="yellow">Honey. How are you feeling? Are you better?</font>

480
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:29,719
<font color="yellow">He's at it again.</font>

481
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,049
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Honey.</font>

482
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:36,489
<font color="yellow">I've been so bad at taking care of you when you're pregnant.</font>

483
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:39,449
<font color="yellow">What? Pregnant?</font>

484
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:42,249
<font color="yellow">I bought a onesie for our baby...</font>

485
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:45,349
<font color="yellow">on my way here.</font>

486
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,749
<font color="yellow">The doctor said it's a son, right?</font>

487
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:52,349
<font color="yellow">I thought about his name.</font>

488
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,119
<font color="yellow">What do you think about "Gwang Woo"?</font>

489
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:59,119
<font color="yellow">It means "bright and lucky".</font>

490
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,189
<font color="yellow">He'll be a bright and lucky guy.</font>

491
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,249
<font color="yellow">I bet you this boy...</font>

492
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,749
<font color="yellow">will become an important figure.</font>

493
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,089
<font color="yellow">You know how busy...</font>

494
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,219
<font color="yellow">my work is.</font>

495
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:19,649
<font color="yellow">Once this project I'm working on is finished,</font>

496
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:21,619
<font color="yellow">I'll be...</font>

497
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:24,649
<font color="yellow">really good to you.</font>

498
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,149
<font color="yellow">Please trust in me, Gwi Ja.</font>

499
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,389
<font color="yellow">You should have been good to me before you went crazy...</font>

500
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:37,789
<font color="yellow">or you should have gone crazy earlier.</font>

501
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:39,449
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

502
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:41,789
<font color="yellow">hungry.</font>

503
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:43,589
<font color="yellow">Give me some food.</font>

504
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,619
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

505
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,249
<font color="yellow">He's at Jae Man's right now.</font>

506
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:04,019
<font color="yellow">He went there alone?</font>

507
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,449
<font color="yellow">By now, they would have noticed...</font>

508
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:09,419
<font color="yellow">his Alzheimer's.</font>

509
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,589
<font color="yellow">We should hurry up and get him.</font>

510
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:23,589
<font color="yellow">Your cooking is just my taste.</font>

511
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:25,889
<font color="yellow">I made that.</font>

512
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:27,049
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

513
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,689
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you, Jae Man?</font>

514
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:33,089
<font color="yellow">If your sister came to see you because she's mad at me,</font>

515
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:34,749
<font color="yellow">you should have persuaded her to go back home!</font>

516
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:43,149
<font color="yellow">- Chew slowly. - Thank you, Honey.</font>

517
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:45,119
<font color="yellow">Here. Have some water.</font>

518
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:57,689
<font color="yellow">When did you buy this fish?</font>

519
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,389
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

520
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,419
<font color="yellow">It's bad enough to prove that he's incompetent, right?</font>

521
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:18,019
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll give the chief a call.</font>

522
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,389
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

523
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,449
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we look after Dad?</font>

524
00:31:26,989 --> 00:31:28,019
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

525
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,619
<font color="yellow">Luck just rolled right in.</font>

526
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,049
<font color="yellow">You said he acts normal once in a while, though.</font>

527
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,919
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter.</font>

528
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:40,249
<font color="yellow">We'll just hide him in a home where Gun Woo can't find him.</font>

529
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:48,019
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - It's Gun Woo.</font>

530
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,949
<font color="yellow">What a surprise. What makes you call me?</font>

531
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:55,089
<font color="yellow">I know Father is there with you.</font>

532
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,519
<font color="yellow">We're outside the door. Bring him out.</font>

533
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:06,419
<font color="yellow">Mum. Gun Woo says...</font>

534
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:07,749
<font color="yellow">he's just outside.</font>

535
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:12,249
<font color="yellow">How did he find out already?</font>

536
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,819
<font color="yellow">You know you're under a restraining order, right?</font>

537
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:21,189
<font color="yellow">Don't make me call the police and bring him out.</font>

538
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:27,719
<font color="yellow">I think we better let him go.</font>

539
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:34,849
<font color="yellow">It'll be over once we can prove his incompetency.</font>

540
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:36,849
<font color="yellow">Let him go.</font>

541
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:53,419
<font color="yellow">Are you sure the chairman is all right?</font>

542
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,089
<font color="yellow">I'm worried...</font>

543
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:57,649
<font color="yellow">- It's true that he has Alzheimer's. - What?</font>

544
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:01,489
<font color="yellow">I got the call from Dr Hwang today.</font>

545
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:04,049
<font color="yellow">The result came out from a test.</font>

546
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:07,589
<font color="yellow">The chairman has Alzheimer's?</font>

547
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,819
<font color="yellow">That's why you must be careful that this doesn't happen again.</font>

548
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:13,049
<font color="yellow">All right, Gun Woo.</font>

549
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:17,149
<font color="yellow">I'll be extra cautious.</font>

550
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,819
<font color="yellow">He leaves home right at 6am.</font>

551
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,119
<font color="yellow">He takes the same route for his daily walk.</font>

552
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,619
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

553
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:47,119
<font color="yellow">Whenever he goes on his walk,</font>

554
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,849
<font color="yellow">he only stretches in front of a specific tree.</font>

555
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:55,089
<font color="yellow">He then has an egg sandwich and coffee at a nearby cafe.</font>

556
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:58,849
<font color="yellow">He'll finish his morning schedule by collecting money from the market.</font>

557
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,989
<font color="yellow">After that, he goes to a restaurant he's been a regular at for 30 years.</font>

558
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,419
<font color="yellow">He has either kimchi jjigae or doenjang jjigae for lunch.</font>

559
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:08,949
<font color="yellow">In the afternoon, he works at home.</font>

560
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,849
<font color="yellow">What kind of schedule is that?</font>

561
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:13,749
<font color="yellow">It's like he's on a treadmill.</font>

562
00:34:14,189 --> 00:34:16,489
<font color="yellow">That's why there is no room for us to squeeze in.</font>

563
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,689
<font color="yellow">Only if he was a tiny bit interested in what I had to say,</font>

564
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:21,889
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I could persuade him then.</font>

565
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,819
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time.</font>

566
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,119
<font color="yellow">Let's give up on Chainsaw So and look for an alternative.</font>

567
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,949
<font color="yellow">I asked around while tailing him.</font>

568
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:33,919
<font color="yellow">He's a stubborn guy. A no is a no even with a knife to his neck.</font>

569
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,689
<font color="yellow">Why are you so stressed?</font>

570
00:34:36,689 --> 00:34:38,389
<font color="yellow">The solution's right there.</font>

571
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,919
<font color="yellow">Leave us alone. I can't think as it is.</font>

572
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,019
<font color="yellow">Ruin his daily life.</font>

573
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,849
<font color="yellow">What would happen to him then?</font>

574
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,689
<font color="yellow">He'd go out of his mind.</font>

575
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:49,849
<font color="yellow">I'm about to go out of my mind, so leave before I do.</font>

576
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,989
<font color="yellow">You're dumb for someone who went to Stanford.</font>

577
00:34:54,249 --> 00:34:55,919
<font color="yellow">Just buy everything.</font>

578
00:34:57,249 --> 00:34:58,349
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

579
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:03,049
<font color="yellow">Buy the cafe and restaurant that he goes to.</font>

580
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,719
<font color="yellow">You said he's paranoid.</font>

581
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:06,219
<font color="yellow">That will drive him crazy.</font>

582
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,589
<font color="yellow">Shin Young. You're really...</font>

583
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:13,159
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll go.</font>

584
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:15,159
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be so cranky.</font>

585
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,749
<font color="yellow">You saved my life. You're the best!</font>

586
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:22,619
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't do this in front of the others.</font>

587
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:27,789
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon, did you get what she just said?</font>

588
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:30,589
<font color="yellow">If we turn his life upside down,</font>

589
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:32,419
<font color="yellow">he'll have to come to you.</font>

590
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:36,419
<font color="yellow">I don't care how much it takes. Take Soo Tak and buy everything.</font>

591
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:37,449
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

592
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:44,319
<font color="yellow">Why do you need to meet Chainsaw So desperately?</font>

593
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:47,659
<font color="yellow">I will buy out all his matured Dodo Group bonds.</font>

594
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:49,589
<font color="yellow">Matured bonds?</font>

595
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:52,349
<font color="yellow">Will you threaten the whole company?</font>

596
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:56,019
<font color="yellow">You just have to trust me and tag along.</font>

597
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,159
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

598
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:02,719
<font color="yellow">I did something great for you. What do I get in return?</font>

599
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:05,159
<font color="yellow">I said I'd make you Dodo Group's Chairwoman.</font>

600
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:07,089
<font color="yellow">That's part of the deal. Kiss me.</font>

601
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:09,589
<font color="yellow">Nothing's for free.</font>

602
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,089
<font color="yellow">Kiss me now.</font>

603
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:13,789
<font color="yellow">Close your eyes.</font>

604
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:15,889
<font color="yellow">What? Okay.</font>

605
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,049
<font color="yellow">Hey! Kang Ga Din! Come back!</font>

606
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:30,489
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan's going around buying the stores in the area?</font>

607
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:35,119
<font color="yellow">Yes, and I just can't figure out why.</font>

608
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:41,159
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be easier for you to strike a deal with Chainsaw So?</font>

609
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:45,849
<font color="yellow">Who knows what Gi Tan will do if you give him time?</font>

610
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:48,889
<font color="yellow">When will he come home?</font>

611
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:51,389
<font color="yellow">He should be here any minute...</font>

612
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:55,659
<font color="yellow">There he is. That's him.</font>

613
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,659
<font color="yellow">Chairman So.</font>

614
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,519
<font color="yellow">Chairman So?</font>

615
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:07,989
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

616
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:09,249
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

617
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:11,319
<font color="yellow">I'm from Dodo Group.</font>

618
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:14,719
<font color="yellow">Do Chi, did he make an appointment?</font>

619
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:16,249
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

620
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:19,289
<font color="yellow">Send them away and set an appointment.</font>

621
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:20,949
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

622
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:22,989
<font color="yellow">My father sent me.</font>

623
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,249
<font color="yellow">Who is your father?</font>

624
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,489
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do Choong of Dodo Group.</font>

625
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,019
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do?</font>

626
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,419
<font color="yellow">You're Vice Chairman Do Gun Woo.</font>

627
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:39,789
<font color="yellow">It's a pleasure to meet you.</font>

628
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,019
<font color="yellow">Come in for some rice punch.</font>

629
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,349
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

630
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:56,749
<font color="yellow">Kang Gi Tan?</font>

631
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:58,949
<font color="yellow">No one with that name was here.</font>

632
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:02,319
<font color="yellow">He owns KT Corporation.</font>

633
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,019
<font color="yellow">Oh, that hunter?</font>

634
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:07,749
<font color="yellow">We met. What about him?</font>

635
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:12,159
<font color="yellow">He's trying to buy your matured bonds.</font>

636
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:13,489
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

637
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,989
<font color="yellow">Are you here because you're afraid I'll sell them to him?</font>

638
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:20,449
<font color="yellow">He is much more cunning than you take him for.</font>

639
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,849
<font color="yellow">Didn't your father tell me about you?</font>

640
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:25,049
<font color="yellow">I've heard rumours about you.</font>

641
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,189
<font color="yellow">You did not.</font>

642
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,849
<font color="yellow">That's why you're here.</font>

643
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:32,249
<font color="yellow">I will never fall for his tricks.</font>

644
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,619
<font color="yellow">Get back to running the company.</font>

645
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:40,049
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir. I trust you'll do the right thing.</font>

646
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:41,819
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

647
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:46,449
<font color="yellow">How is your father's health?</font>

648
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:49,919
<font color="yellow">Rumour says he is very unwell.</font>

649
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:56,049
<font color="yellow">He isn't as ill as the rumours say he is.</font>

650
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:10,319
<font color="yellow">How shall I proceed with your will?</font>

651
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,849
<font color="yellow">Let's make a recording.</font>

652
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,719
<font color="yellow">You said...</font>

653
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:17,159
<font color="yellow">I need two witnesses.</font>

654
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,659
<font color="yellow">Yes. Do you have someone in mind?</font>

655
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:22,349
<font color="yellow">Him.</font>

656
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:25,449
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong is one.</font>

657
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:26,889
<font color="yellow">The other...</font>

658
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:29,159
<font color="yellow">should be Gi Tan.</font>

659
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:31,919
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang?</font>

660
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,159
<font color="yellow">He recently...</font>

661
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:36,449
<font color="yellow">solved a huge financial issue for us.</font>

662
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:37,919
<font color="yellow">He's also...</font>

663
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:40,349
<font color="yellow">very close to Shin Young.</font>

664
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:43,719
<font color="yellow">I think I can trust him with this.</font>

665
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:46,919
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir. I see what you mean.</font>

666
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,849
<font color="yellow">When shall we do it?</font>

667
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,089
<font color="yellow">Next Monday sounds good.</font>

668
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:58,549
<font color="yellow">Tell Chairman Kang what I said.</font>

669
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:00,659
<font color="yellow">I will, Sir.</font>

670
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:16,689
<font color="yellow">Ga Din.</font>

671
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,019
<font color="yellow">Is there anything that makes you sad?</font>

672
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:21,519
<font color="yellow">Why would you ask that?</font>

673
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:23,489
<font color="yellow">Someone said that...</font>

674
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:26,989
<font color="yellow">I should learn to see if the man I like is hurting.</font>

675
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:31,159
<font color="yellow">Try to put something in your head instead of breaking my heart.</font>

676
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:35,419
<font color="yellow">You're so cold and mean to me...</font>

677
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:38,419
<font color="yellow">because something inside is hurting.</font>

678
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:40,619
<font color="yellow">I hate women who talk too much.</font>

679
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:42,849
<font color="yellow">Stop avoid the situation.</font>

680
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:45,319
<font color="yellow">Tell me if something hurts.</font>

681
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,749
<font color="yellow">I'll help you with it.</font>

682
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,749
<font color="yellow">Just try not to make things worse for me.</font>

683
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:55,989
<font color="yellow">Don't mock me.</font>

684
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:59,049
<font color="yellow">It's rude to mistreat me...</font>

685
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:00,619
<font color="yellow">because I like you.</font>

686
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:03,989
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you today?</font>

687
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,549
<font color="yellow">Do you know why my parents drifted apart?</font>

688
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,519
<font color="yellow">It's because my dad looked down on my mum.</font>

689
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:13,919
<font color="yellow">My mum used to love my dad a lot.</font>

690
00:41:14,249 --> 00:41:15,949
<font color="yellow">Then it turned to hatred.</font>

691
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:18,219
<font color="yellow">I saw it all happen.</font>

692
00:41:19,749 --> 00:41:21,989
<font color="yellow">You will marry me.</font>

693
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:26,159
<font color="yellow">Be good to me or I'll nag you forever.</font>

694
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:30,349
<font color="yellow">How many times must I say that I won't marry you?</font>

695
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:36,289
<font color="yellow">Sir, Lawyer Oh is here to see you.</font>

696
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:38,219
<font color="yellow">Why is she here?</font>

697
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:40,249
<font color="yellow">Excuse us for a minute.</font>

698
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:42,049
<font color="yellow">No, I'm going to study.</font>

699
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:44,489
<font color="yellow">Then study hard. I'll leave you to it.</font>

700
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,919
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll leave.</font>

701
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,249
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

702
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:57,789
<font color="yellow">Would you like a drink?</font>

703
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:59,419
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

704
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:14,949
<font color="yellow">"Have a seat."</font>

705
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,419
<font color="yellow">"Would you like a drink?"</font>

706
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:20,189
<font color="yellow">He's cheap for a chairman.</font>

707
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:23,949
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't he play hard to get like he did with me?</font>

708
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:26,619
<font color="yellow">Miss. Miss!</font>

709
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:30,659
<font color="yellow">Congresswoman Hwang is here.</font>

710
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,819
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo? What's she doing here?</font>

711
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,419
<font color="yellow">Why would you come to see me?</font>

712
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:46,389
<font color="yellow">Do you like Kang Gi Tan?</font>

713
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:50,189
<font color="yellow">Why would you ask that?</font>

714
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:52,519
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo's right.</font>

715
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:55,219
<font color="yellow">You've fallen for him.</font>

716
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,119
<font color="yellow">Why do you care where I fall?</font>

717
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:02,189
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

718
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:05,189
<font color="yellow">He's using you.</font>

719
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:08,719
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo.</font>

720
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,449
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything better to do?</font>

721
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,449
<font color="yellow">Why waste your time with gossip?</font>

722
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:15,919
<font color="yellow">- Shin Young. - I have nothing more to hear.</font>

723
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:17,989
<font color="yellow">- Get out. - Gi Tan's parents.</font>

724
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:19,689
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo killed them.</font>

725
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:23,619
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo killed...</font>

726
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:26,749
<font color="yellow">Professor Na Do Gwang and framed Gi Tan.</font>

727
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,119
<font color="yellow">If you think I'm lying,</font>

728
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,949
<font color="yellow">ask Gi Tan to confirm it for you.</font>

729
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:38,619
<font color="yellow">You're just a member of a family he swore to tear down.</font>

730
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,349
<font color="yellow">He will use you for as much as you're worth...</font>

731
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:43,889
<font color="yellow">then get rid of you.</font>

732
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:52,019
<font color="yellow">It would be an honour.</font>

733
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:54,989
<font color="yellow">It's quite meaningful to witness a will being written.</font>

734
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:59,319
<font color="yellow">May I tell Chairman Do that you have accepted?</font>

735
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:00,749
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

736
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:02,689
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

737
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:10,289
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong, this is Lawyer Oh.</font>

738
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,089
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang agreed to be a witness.</font>

739
00:44:17,149 --> 00:44:20,689
<font color="yellow">Yes, pass him the message. Bye.</font>

740
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:35,389
<font color="yellow">I should get going, then.</font>

741
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,219
<font color="yellow">You don't have to get up. You must be busy.</font>

742
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,619
<font color="yellow">I have to take care of some business outside.</font>

743
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:13,419
<font color="yellow">Did you wait until now?</font>

744
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:16,389
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I'll take you home.</font>

745
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:24,289
<font color="yellow">Let's not do this again. I feel terrible.</font>

746
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,389
<font color="yellow">It'll be daybreak soon.</font>

747
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:29,089
<font color="yellow">You wasted your time.</font>

748
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:41,249
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

749
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:45,419
<font color="yellow">Did you know that Soo Yeon and Gi Tan were first loves?</font>

750
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:49,649
<font color="yellow">You didn't.</font>

751
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:53,019
<font color="yellow">We meet again.</font>

752
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,219
<font color="yellow">I'm very impressed.</font>

753
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,619
<font color="yellow">You split up a perfectly fine couple.</font>

754
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:05,019
<font color="yellow">Who is perfectly fine? Il Jae?</font>

755
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:06,249
<font color="yellow">Or you?</font>

756
00:47:06,249 --> 00:47:08,349
<font color="yellow">Watch it, Soo Yeon.</font>

757
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:11,989
<font color="yellow">You must still love him a lot.</font>

758
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:14,449
<font color="yellow">I hope the divorce wasn't for show.</font>

759
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:20,789
<font color="yellow">I plan to send you a little gift. When you see his true colours,</font>

760
00:47:21,649 --> 00:47:23,719
<font color="yellow">you'll thank me for it.</font>

761
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:51,119
<font color="yellow">I did as you said.</font>

762
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:53,419
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

763
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:57,819
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan's doing what he can to swallow the company.</font>

764
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:00,289
<font color="yellow">I must do what I can to stop him.</font>

765
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:02,919
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

766
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,149
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo's killing Gi Tan's parents...</font>

767
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:08,519
<font color="yellow">has nothing to do with you, right?</font>

768
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:12,449

<font color="yellow">I hadn't in 10 years.</font>

926
01:00:02,049 --> 01:00:04,149
<font color="yellow">You bought all of my regular hangouts...</font>

927
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:06,619
<font color="yellow">just to meet me.</font>

928
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:08,749
<font color="yellow">Isn't that too much?</font>

929
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:12,789
<font color="yellow">Talent or wisdom you lack...</font>

930
01:00:13,419 --> 01:00:15,419
<font color="yellow">you can always borrow from someone else.</font>

931
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:19,019
<font color="yellow">But not passion.</font>

932
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:20,989
<font color="yellow">I wanted you...</font>

933
01:00:21,749 --> 01:00:23,619
<font color="yellow">to see my passion.</font>

934
01:00:25,919 --> 01:00:28,149
<font color="yellow">Do you want to take over Dodo Group?</font>

935
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:30,349
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

936
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:33,619
<font color="yellow">Do you have enough money to purchase the bonds?</font>

937
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:35,019
<font color="yellow">What I lack...</font>

938
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:38,049
<font color="yellow">I will borrow from you.</font>

939
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:41,719
<font color="yellow">You will borrow my money to buy my bonds?</font>

940
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:54,119
<font color="yellow">Do you know I charge a lot?</font>

941
01:00:54,449 --> 01:00:55,789
<font color="yellow">Once I take over Dodo Group,</font>

942
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:57,419
<font color="yellow">whether it be a company or land,</font>

943
01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:00,719
<font color="yellow">I will give you everything you need.</font>

944
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:03,289
<font color="yellow">There are many other companies.</font>

945
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:05,549
<font color="yellow">Why do you want Dodo?</font>

946
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:09,249
<font color="yellow">Chairman Do isn't in his right mind.</font>

947
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:11,819
<font color="yellow">His three children...</font>

948
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:14,749
<font color="yellow">are already fighting each other over the inheritance.</font>

949
01:01:17,419 --> 01:01:20,119
<font color="yellow">Madam Hwang is looking to make a comeback,</font>

950
01:01:21,049 --> 01:01:23,249
<font color="yellow">and now Byun Il Jae has jumped into the folds.</font>

951
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:26,349
<font color="yellow">It's much more complicated than it seems from the outside.</font>

952
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:30,819
<font color="yellow">That makes it an easy prey for someone like you.</font>

953
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:33,219
<font color="yellow">If you're holding onto the bonds...</font>

954
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,249
<font color="yellow">for the interest,</font>

955
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:37,049
<font color="yellow">sell them to me.</font>

956
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:40,719
<font color="yellow">If not, you will suffer a great loss.</font>

957
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:50,019
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I'm being threatened by someone your age.</font>

958
01:01:50,019 --> 01:01:51,049
<font color="yellow">It's not a threat.</font>

959
01:01:51,649 --> 01:01:54,549
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you what will happen very soon.</font>

960
01:01:56,189 --> 01:01:58,689
<font color="yellow">My nickname is Chainsaw.</font>

961
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,519
<font color="yellow">I never waver when I make a decision.</font>

962
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:09,119
<font color="yellow">I will take your word for it.</font>

963
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,989
<font color="yellow">You won't regret it, Sir.</font>

964
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:29,689
<font color="yellow">You made him give in.</font>

965
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,149
<font color="yellow">Once Gun Woo's done for,</font>

966
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,189
<font color="yellow">I will propose to Soo Yeon.</font>

967
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:39,019
<font color="yellow">I can get her back...</font>

968
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:43,249
<font color="yellow">very soon.</font>

969
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:57,249
<font color="yellow">(Civil Code...)</font>

970
01:03:00,289 --> 01:03:03,249
<font color="yellow">(Legally incompetent)</font>

971
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:12,849
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, Gun Woo's outside.</font>

972
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:14,019
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo?</font>

973
01:03:21,949 --> 01:03:22,989
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

974
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:28,049
<font color="yellow">What is it? Is something wrong?</font>

975
01:03:28,749 --> 01:03:29,819
<font color="yellow">My father...</font>

976
01:03:31,819 --> 01:03:33,619
<font color="yellow">has six months to live.</font>

977
01:03:34,049 --> 01:03:35,419
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

978
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:36,749
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

979
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:38,989
<font color="yellow">Doctor Hwang just told me.</font>

980
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:40,949
<font color="yellow">He has vascular dementia.</font>

981
01:03:42,149 --> 01:03:43,489
<font color="yellow">It's terminal.</font>

982
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,549
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

983
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:52,049
<font color="yellow">I have to be selfish.</font>

984
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:55,719
<font color="yellow">I can't wait any longer.</font>

985
01:03:58,089 --> 01:03:59,489
<font color="yellow">Before he passes away,</font>

986
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:02,489
<font color="yellow">marry me.</font>

987
01:04:05,419 --> 01:04:08,549
<font color="yellow">If you can't marry me, let's get engaged at least.</font>

990
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:51,149
<font color="yellow">Don't expect anything from me any more.</font>

991
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:52,889
<font color="yellow">This isn't what you had promised.</font>

992
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:55,419
<font color="yellow">I have an idea, Gun Woo.</font>

993
01:04:55,419 --> 01:04:57,119
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong, who is this?</font>

994
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,249
<font color="yellow">You don't have much longer.</font>

995
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:01,449
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that you can help me?</font>

996
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:03,689
<font color="yellow">I will do what you've asked me to do.</font>

997
01:05:03,689 --> 01:05:06,789
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's up to something, but I'm not sure what that is.</font>

998
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:09,289
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that my answer is so late.</font>

999
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:10,889
<font color="yellow">Let's get engaged.</font>
