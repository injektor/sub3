00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
<font color="yellow">Sir, this is...</font>

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,380
<font color="yellow">I'm sure of it. It's the blueprint.</font>

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,550
<font color="yellow">This is mine. It's a plane.</font>

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,180
<font color="yellow">Did you really draw this?</font>

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,010
<font color="yellow">I drew it. I'm a genius.</font>

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,610
<font color="yellow">Photographic memory.</font>

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,450
<font color="yellow">The blueprint is inside his head.</font>

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,120
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,120
<font color="yellow">You will feel very sleepy.</font>

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,150
<font color="yellow">Have a good, long rest.</font>

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo. No, you have to wake up.</font>

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,910
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo...</font>

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,980
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo. Dong Soo.</font>

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,180
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo.</font>

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,280
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,780
<font color="yellow">(Episode 25)</font>

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,150
<font color="yellow">I think that car is with Il Jae, too.</font>

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,580
<font color="yellow">Where is he going this late?</font>

19
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,480
<font color="yellow">(Funeral hall)</font>

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,110
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan will be here.</font>

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,450
<font color="yellow">Find him.</font>

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,450
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

23
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,330
<font color="yellow">Isn't this Soo Yeon's brother's funeral hall?</font>

24
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,380
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

25
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,950
<font color="yellow">Then he's here to get you.</font>

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,980
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming.</font>

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,780
<font color="yellow">If you haven't eaten, go and have some soup.</font>

28
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,610
<font color="yellow">This way, Vice Chairman.</font>

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,310
<font color="yellow">I saw you at the hospital...</font>

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,050
<font color="yellow">on the day Dong Soo died.</font>

31
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,180
<font color="yellow">Didn't he have a heart attack?</font>

32
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,550
<font color="yellow">That's what I heard.</font>

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,860
<font color="yellow">His heart was completely fine.</font>

34
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,380
<font color="yellow">He couldn't have died like that!</font>

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,470
<font color="yellow">But why are you telling me this?</font>

36
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,950
<font color="yellow">I signed up for his autopsy.</font>

37
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,110
<font color="yellow">I will do everything I can...</font>

38
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,150
<font color="yellow">to make the criminal pay...</font>

39
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,210
<font color="yellow">for murdering my brother.</font>

40
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,180
<font color="yellow">Are you Lee Soo Tak?</font>

41
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

42
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,350
<font color="yellow">You are under arrest...</font>

43
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,150
<font color="yellow">for violating the law on industrial technology protection.</font>

44
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,050
<font color="yellow">You have the right to consult an attorney...</font>

45
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,260
<font color="yellow">and the right to remain silent.</font>

46
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,910
<font color="yellow">You can refuse to testify against you.</font>

47
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

48
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,410
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I haven't done anything.</font>

49
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,630
<font color="yellow">Take him.</font>

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,860
<font color="yellow">- Come with us.
- Wait a second.</font>

51
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,880
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,910
<font color="yellow">Are you Oh Soo Yeon?</font>

54
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,710
<font color="yellow">You must come, too.</font>

55
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,550
<font color="yellow">I'm a lawyer.</font>

56
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,880
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing at a funeral?</font>

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,010
<font color="yellow">Are you Lawyer Min Byung Ho?</font>

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,010
<font color="yellow">You have to come with us, too.</font>

59
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,250
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

60
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,350
<font color="yellow">Detective Kim.</font>

61
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,150
<font color="yellow">Their family member died. Leave them.</font>

62
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,320
<font color="yellow">Just check their phones.</font>

63
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,750
<font color="yellow">It would be cruel of us to take them to the station.</font>

64
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,780
<font color="yellow">Let me see your phones.</font>

65
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,180
<font color="yellow">It's Soo Tak.</font>

66
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,610
<font color="yellow">They don't have the blueprint in their phones.</font>

67
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,210
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

68
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,680
<font color="yellow">You should have been more careful with the blueprint.</font>

69
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,080
<font color="yellow">We could've been in trouble.</font>

70
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,050
<font color="yellow">Is that why you killed my brother?</font>

71
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,750
<font color="yellow">We received the blueprint...</font>

72
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,910
<font color="yellow">through an official contract with Professor Na before he died.</font>

73
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,650
<font color="yellow">You were the ones who stole that blueprint...</font>

74
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,380
<font color="yellow">in order to prove Gi Tan's innocence.</font>

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,780
<font color="yellow">You're going to ask for an autopsy?</font>

76
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,510
<font color="yellow">Be my guest.</font>

77
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,010
<font color="yellow">The criminal is you,</font>

78
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,550
<font color="yellow">not us.</font>

79
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,680
<font color="yellow">Soo Tak was accused of being an industrial spy?</font>

80
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,480
<font color="yellow">Il Jae, that snake.</font>

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,680
<font color="yellow">He struck first before we could report it.</font>

82
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,210
<font color="yellow">How is Soo Yeon?</font>

83
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,250
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

84
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,580
<font color="yellow">She's out of it.</font>

85
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,950
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of her.</font>

86
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't worry about that. You should be careful.</font>

87
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,210
<font color="yellow">What happened with Ok Chae Ryung?</font>

88
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,210
<font color="yellow">No updates yet.</font>

89
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,550
<font color="yellow">I should go. Soo Yeon is alone.</font>

90
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,780
<font color="yellow">Please tell your brother...</font>

91
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,980
<font color="yellow">"thank you" for lending the taxi.</font>

92
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,680
<font color="yellow">His license got suspended, so he can't drive anyway.</font>

93
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,010
<font color="yellow">Call me if you need me.</font>

94
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,710
<font color="yellow">Let's run away abroad with the blueprint.</font>

95
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,810
<font color="yellow">I'll leave with Jeong Eun.</font>

96
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,710
<font color="yellow">It'll be better to tell them this.</font>

97
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,710
<font color="yellow">If they let us go to the States,</font>

98
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,910
<font color="yellow">we'll give them the Chinese license.</font>

99
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,880
<font color="yellow">Boss is looking for you.</font>

100
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,850
<font color="yellow">You still haven't seen Gi Tan?</font>

101
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,710
<font color="yellow">Cha Woo.</font>

102
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,090
<font color="yellow">How long do you plan to be with this organisation?</font>

103
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,180
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

104
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,210
<font color="yellow">Don't you know we can't leave until we die?</font>

105
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,950
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave.</font>

106
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,140
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

107
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,450
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

108
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,710
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung.</font>

109
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,650
<font color="yellow">I know you're sick of this life, too.</font>

110
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,110
<font color="yellow">You don't want to live like a puppet for the rest of your life, do you?</font>

111
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,950
<font color="yellow">We have no other choice.</font>

112
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,080
<font color="yellow">All we need is the blueprint.</font>

113
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,750
<font color="yellow">If we have that,</font>

114
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,280
<font color="yellow">we can live anywhere and do well.</font>

115
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,670
<font color="yellow">Betrayal means death.</font>

116
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,910
<font color="yellow">I just told you that I have a plan.</font>

117
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,110
<font color="yellow">I'll ignore what you just told me.</font>

118
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,880
<font color="yellow">Cha Woo.</font>

119
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,780
<font color="yellow">Don't ever mention it to me again.</font>

120
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,510
<font color="yellow">It's me, Mr Yeom.</font>

121
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,150
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you something.</font>

122
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,680
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung is the contact for Gi Tan,</font>

123
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,710
<font color="yellow">but I don't think she's in touch with him yet.</font>

124
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,550
<font color="yellow">Are there any other ways...</font>

125
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,110
<font color="yellow">he can get in touch with Gi Ryang?</font>

126
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,580
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

127
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,150
<font color="yellow">All right. Keep it up.</font>

128
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,420
<font color="yellow">Do you plan on bringing Chae Ryung to our side?</font>

129
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,150
<font color="yellow">That might be...</font>

130
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,480
<font color="yellow">the fastest way...</font>

131
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,780
<font color="yellow">to get rid of Gi Tan.</font>

132
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,080
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

133
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,920
<font color="yellow">Luckily,</font>

134
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,580
<font color="yellow">Gi Ryang doesn't have the blueprint yet.</font>

135
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,380
<font color="yellow">Is it true what Soo Yeon said?</font>

136
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,710
<font color="yellow">Did you kill her brother?</font>

137
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,950
<font color="yellow">Do you know what this situation is like?</font>

138
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,510
<font color="yellow">It's like a thief claiming his innocence.</font>

139
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,310
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon stole the blueprint, but she's blaming me.</font>

140
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,750
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

141
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,510
<font color="yellow">I would never lie to you.</font>

142
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,510
<font color="yellow">Don't ever touch Soo Yeon.</font>

143
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,210
<font color="yellow">Even if Gi Tan has it,</font>

144
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,440
<font color="yellow">it'll take a while to decode.</font>

145
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,210
<font color="yellow">We can decode it and apply for the patent.</font>

146
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
<font color="yellow">If you...</font>

147
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,250
<font color="yellow">have feelings for Soo Yeon, you need to get over it.</font>

148
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,920
<font color="yellow">It's no time for you to be falling in love.</font>

149
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,810
<font color="yellow">On top of that,</font>

150
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,930
<font color="yellow">you have a big project in front of you.</font>

151
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,180
<font color="yellow">Do I have to get your permission to like someone?</font>

152
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,210
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo.</font>

153
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,980
<font color="yellow">Don't get involved in my life.</font>

154
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,010
<font color="yellow">We're nothing more than business partners.</font>

155
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,880
<font color="yellow">Business partners?</font>

156
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,380
<font color="yellow">The vaccine will be decoded by the promised date.</font>

157
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,710
<font color="yellow">Everything will go according to plan.</font>

158
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,950
<font color="yellow">But if something happens to Soo Yeon by any chance,</font>

159
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,610
<font color="yellow">our plan will be ruined. Mark my words.</font>

160
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

161
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,150
<font color="yellow">If that's how you feel,</font>

162
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,750
<font color="yellow">I'll respect you.</font>

163
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
<font color="yellow">There's an empty office...</font>

164
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,030
<font color="yellow">inside that building.</font>

165
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,680
<font color="yellow">Is Gi Tan up there?</font>

166
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,780
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's waiting for you.</font>

167
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,450
<font color="yellow">All right. Thank you.</font>

168
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,880
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan.</font>

169
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,980
<font color="yellow">- What did the autopsy say?
- It's a heart attack.</font>

170
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,250
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

171
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,580
<font color="yellow">what the doctor says throws me off.</font>

172
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,280
<font color="yellow">It's true that he had a huge shock to his heart,</font>

173
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,280
<font color="yellow">but there are no marks proving that he was drugged.</font>

174
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,990
<font color="yellow">It was definitely a murder.</font>

175
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,310
<font color="yellow">We're sure that it was, but we have no evidence.</font>

176
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,480
<font color="yellow">That's why it's driving us crazy.</font>

177
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,530
<font color="yellow">What does Soo Yeon think?</font>

178
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,180
<font color="yellow">She also thinks that someone killed him.</font>

179
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,950
<font color="yellow">If there is no evidence,</font>

180
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,250
<font color="yellow">we'll make it up to find out the truth.</font>

181
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,650
<font color="yellow">I'm going to prove...</font>

182
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,980
<font color="yellow">that Il Jae killed Dong Soo.</font>

183
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,480
<font color="yellow">Listen, you're on the run.</font>

184
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,750
<font color="yellow">You have to be careful.</font>

185
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,980
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo died because of me.</font>

186
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,780
<font color="yellow">He was trying to prove my innocence.</font>

187
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,810
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon lost her brother for it.</font>

188
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,250
<font color="yellow">When she was young,</font>

189
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,910
<font color="yellow">she lost her dad because of me, too.</font>

190
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,880
<font color="yellow">I heard what happened,</font>

191
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,380
<font color="yellow">but she doesn't think like that at all.</font>

192
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,980
<font color="yellow">I can't bear to watch her...</font>

193
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,850
<font color="yellow">become unhappy because of me.</font>

194
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,550
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure...</font>

195
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,650
<font color="yellow">I solve this.</font>

196
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,410
<font color="yellow">Mr Moon, is the chairman going to work today?</font>

197
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,950
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

198
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,860
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to give him his pills.</font>

199
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,820
<font color="yellow">He just had them now. Don't worry.</font>

200
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,510
<font color="yellow">How can I not?</font>

201
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,650
<font color="yellow">His condition keeps getting worse.</font>

202
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,210
<font color="yellow">Honey,</font>

203
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,850
<font color="yellow">are you sure you can go to work?</font>

204
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,680
<font color="yellow">Even if I have to get an IV,</font>

205
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,410
<font color="yellow">I'll get it at work.</font>

206
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,750
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

207
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,650
<font color="yellow">What have you been up to?</font>

208
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,750
<font color="yellow">I've been attending the junior CEO association meetings,</font>

209
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,950
<font color="yellow">and I attended a seminar on free economy yesterday.</font>

210
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,080
<font color="yellow">Who holds a seminar in the middle of the night?</font>

211
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,310
<font color="yellow">You slept all day long...</font>

212
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,280
<font color="yellow">and went out at night.</font>

213
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,150
<font color="yellow">What time did you come home?</font>

214
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,040
<font color="yellow">You know nothing about seminars on economy.</font>

215
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,080
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

216
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,110
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

217
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,980
<font color="yellow">Come to work starting today.</font>

218
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,580
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

219
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,150
<font color="yellow">Don't sit around at home.</font>

220
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,310
<font color="yellow">Come to work.</font>

221
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,050
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

222
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,650
<font color="yellow">His health is faltering,</font>

223
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,510
<font color="yellow">so you should help him.</font>

224
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,550
<font color="yellow">Father, I will do my best.</font>

225
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,450
<font color="yellow">I can give my life to this company.</font>

226
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,150
<font color="yellow">No one wants your life.</font>

227
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,210
<font color="yellow">Chief Secretary Moon, you will be assisting...</font>

228
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,200
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo.</font>

229
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chairman.</font>

230
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,310
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

231
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,180
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

232
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,450
<font color="yellow">Hey, ride your own car.</font>

233
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,310
<font color="yellow">Dad wants me to get in.</font>

234
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,510
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

235
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,360
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make a sweet return with Chairman, but she ruined it.</font>

236
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,010
<font color="yellow">Mr Do, you can come with me.</font>

237
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

238
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,810
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

239
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,250
<font color="yellow">Mr Do?</font>

240
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,770
<font color="yellow">Is he one of the rank and file?</font>

241
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

242
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,550
<font color="yellow">Chairman sent him to the management department.</font>

243
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,650
<font color="yellow">Is he insane?</font>

244
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,930
<font color="yellow">Mum, is this how I should be treated?</font>

245
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,680
<font color="yellow">Don't go. You'll damage my honour, too.</font>

246
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,980
<font color="yellow">Chairman is putting Mr Do through a test.</font>

247
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,380
<font color="yellow">A test?</font>

248
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,680
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't pass,</font>

249
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,010
<font color="yellow">he'll never let him come back.</font>

250
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,550
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll go to work.</font>

251
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,950
<font color="yellow">Let's see how far...</font>

252
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
<font color="yellow">he goes.</font>

253
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,450
<font color="yellow">Hold out until the general meeting.</font>

254
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,150
<font color="yellow">I will make you the best after that meeting.</font>

255
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,750
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Mr Do.
- Come on.</font>

256
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,890
<font color="yellow">Stop calling me that.</font>

257
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,950
<font color="yellow">I can't call you CEO Do any more.</font>

258
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,280
<font color="yellow">Where's your car?</font>

259
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,510
<font color="yellow">Over there.</font>

260
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,850
<font color="yellow">Do people know...</font>

261
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,080
<font color="yellow">that I'm demoted?</font>

262
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,010
<font color="yellow">The announcement is out.</font>

263
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,180
<font color="yellow">What does a management department do?</font>

264
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,780
<font color="yellow">You were once a CEO. How can you not know?</font>

265
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,580
<font color="yellow">How could I know?</font>

266
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,780
<font color="yellow">Go to the storage.</font>

267
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,010
<font color="yellow">The storage?</font>

268
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,380
<font color="yellow">It's a place to manage supplies.</font>

269
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,310
<font color="yellow">You have to fill out a lot of papers.</font>

270
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,850
<font color="yellow">It's harder than you think.</font>

271
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,630
<font color="yellow">You know what? No one asked you.</font>

272
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,450
<font color="yellow">Vice Chairman of SPD does not teach a mere employee...</font>

273
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,200
<font color="yellow">about managing supplies.</font>

274
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,880
<font color="yellow">So what? Do you want me to consider this as an honour?</font>

275
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,550
<font color="yellow">Chief Secretary Moon.</font>

276
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,820
<font color="yellow">Yes, Vice Chairman.</font>

277
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,530
<font color="yellow">Who's in charge of supply management?</font>

278
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,780
<font color="yellow">It's Chief Go Geum Sang.</font>

279
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,080
<font color="yellow">Tell him to come to my office.</font>

280
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,650
<font color="yellow">What is he trying to do?</font>

281
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,010
<font color="yellow">This is work and he's Vice Chairman.</font>

282
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,980
<font color="yellow">- So what?
- If you'll work, work.</font>

283
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,050
<font color="yellow">If not, go home right now.</font>

284
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,010
<font color="yellow">Where is the storage?</font>

285
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,580
<font color="yellow">First basement.</font>

286
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,280
<font color="yellow">Gosh, darn it.</font>

287
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,850
<font color="yellow">(Dodo Group)</font>

288
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,850
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

289
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,350
<font color="yellow">It's me, Gi Tan.</font>

290
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan!</font>

291
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,150
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you?</font>

292
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,480
<font color="yellow">Is the blueprint safe with you?</font>

293
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,580
<font color="yellow">Come out and meet me right now.</font>

294
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,780
<font color="yellow">If you do anything rash,</font>

295
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,350
<font color="yellow">you won't lay your hands on the blueprint.</font>

296
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,310
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. I'll be there.</font>

297
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,850
<font color="yellow">Just tell me where.</font>

298
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,120
<font color="yellow">Okay, send me the address.</font>

299
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,210
<font color="yellow">Okay, Gi Tan. I'll see you there. Bye.</font>

300
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
<font color="yellow">Finally.</font>

301
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,280
<font color="yellow">This is the luck of my life.</font>

302
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
<font color="yellow">Did I surprise you?</font>

303
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,580
<font color="yellow">My gosh!</font>

304
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,280
<font color="yellow">Why does he want to meet here?</font>

305
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,810
<font color="yellow">Gwang Woo is headed over.</font>

306
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,910
<font color="yellow">No, he's alone.</font>

307
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,550
<font color="yellow">- Gi Tan.
- Silence. Follow me.</font>

308
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,310
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, what happened?</font>

309
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,910
<font color="yellow">I was really worried about you.</font>

310
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,190
<font color="yellow">Don't be so friendly. I'm not glad to see you.</font>

311
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, you are.</font>

312
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,350
<font color="yellow">You didn't call me for nothing.</font>

313
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,350
<font color="yellow">Okay. Where is the blueprint?</font>

314
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,020
<font color="yellow">Show me the blueprint first.</font>

315
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,780
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll give you anything you want.</font>

316
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,650
<font color="yellow">What... What is this?</font>

317
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,510
<font color="yellow">It's just a music sheet.</font>

318
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,010
<font color="yellow">This is the blueprint.</font>

319
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,080
<font color="yellow">The deceased Professor Na wrote it as a code.</font>

320
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,030
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to fool me?</font>

321
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,180
<font color="yellow">You can check with Il Jae if you like.</font>

322
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,280
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

323
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,180
<font color="yellow">The original is...</font>

324
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,280
<font color="yellow">in his hands.</font>

325
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

326
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,310
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo is probably...</font>

327
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,480
<font color="yellow">decoding it right now.</font>

328
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,760
<font color="yellow">Did you just say, Gun Woo?</font>

329
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,180
<font color="yellow">Il Jae and Gun Woo were...</font>

330
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,310
<font color="yellow">on the same side all along.</font>

331
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,170
<font color="yellow">Why would my brother-in-law do that?</font>

332
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,850
<font color="yellow">Don't you get it?</font>

333
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,410
<font color="yellow">Do I have to explain everything for you?</font>

334
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,450
<font color="yellow">Wait, that means...</font>

335
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,000
<font color="yellow">Il Jae wants to make Gun Woo the successor.</font>

336
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,480
<font color="yellow">Later, he'll try to take it for himself.</font>

337
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,280
<font color="yellow">It's pretty easy.</font>

338
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,950
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, wait. I'm dizzy.</font>

339
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,280
<font color="yellow">Give me some time to think.</font>

340
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,010
<font color="yellow">I have no time to wait for you.</font>

341
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,180
<font color="yellow">So listen to me and do as I say.</font>

342
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,680
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon's brother is dead.</font>

343
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,650
<font color="yellow">Il Jae killed him because of this blueprint.</font>

344
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,150
<font color="yellow">You have to find the evidence of his murder.</font>

345
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,480
<font color="yellow">You can't beat Gun Woo...</font>

346
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,710
<font color="yellow">with Il Jae around.</font>

347
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,310
<font color="yellow">You'll be completely destroyed...</font>

348
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,710
<font color="yellow">once he decodes the blueprint.</font>

349
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,380
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

350
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,510
<font color="yellow">It was Il Jae...</font>

351
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,150
<font color="yellow">who brought Gun Woo.</font>

352
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,580
<font color="yellow">Who do they think they are?</font>

353
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,770
<font color="yellow">You can wait here.</font>

354
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,910
<font color="yellow">Will Director Byun say that he murdered someone?</font>

355
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,950
<font color="yellow">I have to try.</font>

356
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,470
<font color="yellow">Don't get caught, Sir.</font>

357
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,010
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm not a kid.</font>

358
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,950
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

359
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,780
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

360
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,580
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your discharge.</font>

361
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,940
<font color="yellow">How's Chairman doing?</font>

362
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,720
<font color="yellow">Let's cut to the chase.</font>

363
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,650
<font color="yellow">I heard you are with Gun Woo.</font>

364
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,670
<font color="yellow">You met Gi Tan.</font>

365
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,680
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

366
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,450
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid people will know that you murdered Soo Yeon's brother?</font>

367
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,560
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan...</font>

368
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,780
<font color="yellow">showed me the blueprint.</font>

369
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,020
<font color="yellow">I wanted it at first,</font>

370
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,050
<font color="yellow">but then I thought about why he would show that to me.</font>

371
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,010
<font color="yellow">He just wants to come between us.</font>

372
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,150
<font color="yellow">Il Jae.</font>

373
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,190
<font color="yellow">You can tell me.</font>

374
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,210
<font color="yellow">Was it you?</font>

375
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,580
<font color="yellow">Did you kill Soo Yeon's brother?</font>

376
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,650
<font color="yellow">You don't need to keep it a secret from me.</font>

377
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,680
<font color="yellow">Hey! What are you doing?</font>

378
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,550
<font color="yellow">Let go! Get away from me!</font>

379
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,450
<font color="yellow">Did Gi Tan put you up to this? To get my confession?</font>

380
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,610
<font color="yellow">Don't get involved with him!</font>

381
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,710
<font color="yellow">He's the son of Director Jung whom you killed. He's Guk Cheol!</font>

382
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,210
<font color="yellow">Give me the vaccine's blueprint.</font>

383
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,950
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to get rid of me by using Gun Woo?</font>

384
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,950
<font color="yellow">You're worse than Gi Tan!</font>

385
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
<font color="yellow">Get him.</font>

386
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,850
<font color="yellow">What? Hey, let go.</font>

387
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,880
<font color="yellow">Hey. Do you want to die?</font>

388
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,580
<font color="yellow">Did you just hit me?</font>

389
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,310
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

390
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,910
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

391
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,880
<font color="yellow">You're rude, incompetent and evil.</font>

392
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,950
<font color="yellow">So why wouldn't I hit you?</font>

393
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,480
<font color="yellow">Let him go.</font>

394
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,510
<font color="yellow">Fine. You just watch.</font>

395
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,250
<font color="yellow">That blueprint will end up in my hands.</font>

396
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,150
<font color="yellow">Bark all you want.</font>

397
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,450
<font color="yellow">Your father-in-law whom you respect so much...</font>

398
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,380
<font color="yellow">is my uncle.</font>

399
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,950
<font color="yellow">He's my mum's brother.</font>

400
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,510
<font color="yellow">Whom do you think he'll take sides with...</font>

401
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,550
<font color="yellow">between me and Gun Woo?</font>

402
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,860
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can make our family fall...</font>

403
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,010
<font color="yellow">by bringing in Gun Woo?</font>

404
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,980
<font color="yellow">That blueprint...</font>

405
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,110
<font color="yellow">will end up being mine.</font>

406
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,350
<font color="yellow">I'll make it that way, Director Byun.</font>

407
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,950
<font color="yellow">What a headache.</font>

408
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,580
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- What happened?</font>

409
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,150
<font color="yellow">I got it, Gi Tan.</font>

410
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,090
<font color="yellow">You got the evidence?</font>

411
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,150
<font color="yellow">Yes. Il Jae said so himself...</font>

412
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,710
<font color="yellow">that he killed Soo Yeon's brother.</font>

413
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,310
<font color="yellow">What about the recording?</font>

414
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,350
<font color="yellow">It's crystal clear.</font>

415
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,950
<font color="yellow">So send me the blueprint first.</font>

416
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,880
<font color="yellow">Then I'll send you the recording.</font>

417
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,310
<font color="yellow">No, you send it first.</font>

418
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,450
<font color="yellow">I'll check it first before sending it to you.</font>

419
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,300
<font color="yellow">Let's meet then.</font>

420
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,310
<font color="yellow">How about we exchange them on the spot?</font>

421
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,080
<font color="yellow">Hello? Gi Tan?</font>

422
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,710
<font color="yellow">Are you listening?</font>

423
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,210
<font color="yellow">Don't try to trick me.</font>

424
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,790
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

425
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,100
<font color="yellow">I just told you. I have the recording.</font>

426
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,610
<font color="yellow">An idiot like you...</font>

427
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,350
<font color="yellow">could never fool Il Jae.</font>

428
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,940
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

429
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,710
<font color="yellow">Just like how you were used until now,</font>

430
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,650
<font color="yellow">you'll continue to be used by him...</font>

431
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,110
<font color="yellow">until he throws you out like trash.</font>

432
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,510
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

433
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,850
<font color="yellow">Find the evidence first.</font>

434
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,280
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to get rid of Gun Woo and to save yourself.</font>

435
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,750
<font color="yellow">I'm only telling you this because I feel sorry for you, you pushover.</font>

436
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,010
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gi Tan!</font>

437
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,850
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

438
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,750
<font color="yellow">"Pushover"?</font>

439
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,580
<font color="yellow">What do all these garbage take me for?</font>

440
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,110
<font color="yellow">I knew he couldn't get it.</font>

441
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,210
<font color="yellow">But he's tenacious.</font>

442
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,550
<font color="yellow">He won't give up easily.</font>

443
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,810
<font color="yellow">(Unidentified number)</font>

444
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,980
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

445
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,180
<font color="yellow">Did you have a nice chat with Gwang Woo?</font>

446
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,510
<font color="yellow">Guk Cheol, where are you?</font>

447
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,150
<font color="yellow">I was always near you.</font>

448
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,980
<font color="yellow">You just didn't notice me.</font>

449
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,180
<font color="yellow">Let's meet.</font>

450
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,480
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

451
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,410
<font color="yellow">Look over there.</font>

452
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,750
<font color="yellow">I'll give it to you.</font>

453
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,330
<font color="yellow">You know how to strangle me without moving a finger.</font>

454
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,180
<font color="yellow">It's what you taught me when I was in prison.</font>

455
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,280
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

456
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,480
<font color="yellow">People are dying out...</font>

457
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,050
<font color="yellow">from prison as if to keep you entertained.</font>

458
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,650
<font color="yellow">Do Gwang Woo or Lee Guk Cheol?</font>

459
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,310
<font color="yellow">Who will die first?</font>

460
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,250
<font color="yellow">Whoever it is, I hope he rests in peace.</font>

461
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,910
<font color="yellow">"Do Gwang Woo or Byun Il Jae?"</font>

462
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,350
<font color="yellow">"Who will die first?"</font>

463
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,750
<font color="yellow">"Whoever it is,"</font>

464
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,050
<font color="yellow">"I hope he rests in peace."</font>

465
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,720
<font color="yellow">Before that happens,</font>

466
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,610
<font color="yellow">Gi Ryang will kill you. You can take my word for it.</font>

467
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,250
<font color="yellow">Should I give you a tip as well?</font>

468
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,150
<font color="yellow">Before I see your end,</font>

469
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,910
<font color="yellow">I will never die, Il Jae.</font>

470
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,610
<font color="yellow">He disappeared.</font>

471
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,580
<font color="yellow">I've informed the police, so let's wait and see.</font>

472
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,150
<font color="yellow">It's an inspection.</font>

473
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,210
<font color="yellow">Sir, could you lift up your head?</font>

474
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,950
<font color="yellow">Don't throw up in the car.</font>

475
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,280
<font color="yellow">Do it in this bag.</font>

476
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,350
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go.</font>

477
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

478
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,610
<font color="yellow">We should be careful for a while.</font>

479
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,710
<font color="yellow">Why hasn't Chae Ryung called?</font>

480
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,760
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. She must have her reasons.</font>

481
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,180
<font color="yellow">Is she trustworthy?</font>

482
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,490
<font color="yellow">We'll both be in danger if she changes her mind.</font>

483
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,910
<font color="yellow">She'd never betray me.</font>

484
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,880
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

485
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,210
<font color="yellow">What happened with Gi Tan?</font>

486
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,610
<font color="yellow">I haven't found him yet.</font>

487
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,380
<font color="yellow">I can't wait much longer.</font>

488
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,310
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Boss.</font>

489
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,480
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it soon.</font>

490
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,650
<font color="yellow">When he got his vision back,</font>

491
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,380
<font color="yellow">that's when...</font>

492
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,210
<font color="yellow">you suggested that we recruit him to our organisation.</font>

493
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,880
<font color="yellow">I regret...</font>

494
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,610
<font color="yellow">not listening to you then.</font>

495
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,310
<font color="yellow">If someone like him was under me,</font>

496
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,910
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't worry about my successor.</font>

497
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,110
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung.</font>

498
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,080
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

499
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,610
<font color="yellow">The only way for him to live...</font>

500
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,150
<font color="yellow">is to come work for me.</font>

501
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,060
<font color="yellow">Do you mean that you will accept him?</font>

502
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,230
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

503
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,930
<font color="yellow">He doesn't suit our organisation.</font>

504
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,450
<font color="yellow">He's the one...</font>

505
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,350
<font color="yellow">that we really need.</font>

506
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,010
<font color="yellow">He stole the blueprint.</font>

507
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,980
<font color="yellow">We should follow our rules and terminate him.</font>

508
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,780
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan...</font>

509
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,250
<font color="yellow">is a weapon I really want to have.</font>

510
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,150
<font color="yellow">A dealer like myself...</font>

511
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,550
<font color="yellow">shouldn't miss such an opportunity.</font>

512
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,610
<font color="yellow">You asked me to leave with you.</font>

513
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,850
<font color="yellow">Does the offer still stand?</font>

514
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,150
<font color="yellow">I think our boss wants Gi Tan as his heir.</font>

515
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,180
<font color="yellow">I can't stand that.</font>

516
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,520
<font color="yellow">After all I did...</font>

517
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,710
<font color="yellow">to serve him...</font>

518
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,110
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this?</font>

519
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,380
<font color="yellow">If you can keep me safe.</font>

520
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,410
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about it again.</font>

521
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,110
<font color="yellow">This is Ok Chae Ryung.</font>

522
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,710
<font color="yellow">You're a hard person to reach.</font>

523
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,450
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

524
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,480
<font color="yellow">Let's meet up.</font>

525
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,480
<font color="yellow">I have no reason to meet you.</font>

526
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,710
<font color="yellow">Why won't you tell your boss...</font>

527
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,080
<font color="yellow">that you met Gi Tan?</font>

528
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,520
<font color="yellow">You aren't the only one with ears.</font>

529
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,250
<font color="yellow">I have spies everywhere as well.</font>

530
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,710
<font color="yellow">Come to the gallery.</font>

531
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,210
<font color="yellow">Do you think she'll accept our demand?</font>

532
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,550
<font color="yellow">A broken reed...</font>

533
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,450
<font color="yellow">will keep on swaying.</font>

534
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,780
<font color="yellow">She's broken.</font>

535
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,610
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you want.</font>

536
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,150
<font color="yellow">I want you to stop Gi Tan...</font>

537
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,710
<font color="yellow">from giving your boss the blueprint.</font>

538
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,880
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me to betray my organisation?</font>

539
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,180
<font color="yellow">Once we get the patent,</font>

540
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,550
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 15 percent of the royalties.</font>

541
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,280
<font color="yellow">Do you need time to think?</font>

542
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,950
<font color="yellow">I refuse.</font>

543
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,580
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- I don't like you.</font>

544
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,850
<font color="yellow">I don't think...</font>

545
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,410
<font color="yellow">you'd waste the rest of your life serving Jo Gi Ryang.</font>

546
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,620
<font color="yellow">You and I are both cornered.</font>

547
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,450
<font color="yellow">We can help...</font>

548
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,880
<font color="yellow">and benefit each other, too.</font>

549
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,180
<font color="yellow">Do you still not like me?</font>

550
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,650
<font color="yellow">I want 30 percent of the royalties.</font>

551
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,010
<font color="yellow">You want too much.</font>

552
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,150
<font color="yellow">I think it's scrap value for having to risk my life.</font>

553
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
<font color="yellow">It's a deal.</font>

554
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,950
<font color="yellow">I want a legally binding contract.</font>

555
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,930
<font color="yellow">I'll hire the lawyer.</font>

556
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,120
<font color="yellow">Bring the contract tomorrow.</font>

557
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,240
<font color="yellow">I like how you do business.</font>

558
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,710
<font color="yellow">You're a true lobbyist.</font>

559
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,250
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo, don't go.</font>

560
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,980
<font color="yellow">Don't leave me.</font>

561
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,180
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo...</font>

562
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,310
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo!</font>

563
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,250
<font color="yellow">Come back, Dong Soo...</font>

564
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,550
<font color="yellow">Dong Soo...</font>

565
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,280
<font color="yellow">He won't be in pain any more.</font>

566
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,250
<font color="yellow">He went to a good place.</font>

567
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:35,350
<font color="yellow">He left just like that, so you wouldn't need to nurse him any more.</font>

568
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,810
<font color="yellow">Try to cheer up now.</font>

569
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,750
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

570
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,050
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

571
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,480
<font color="yellow">Did you ask around?</font>

572
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,850
<font color="yellow">Yes. I had someone look into it for me.</font>

573
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,000
<font color="yellow">- Thanks.
- Here.</font>

574
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,110
<font color="yellow">Is this it?</font>

575
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,950
<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

576
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,750
<font color="yellow">Isn't this the doctor who performed Dong Soo's autopsy?</font>

577
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,020
<font color="yellow">Why is he with Il Jae?</font>

578
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,210
<font color="yellow">The autopsy result...</font>

579
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
<font color="yellow">was fabricated.</font>

580
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,680
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep a wink last night.</font>

581
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,510
<font color="yellow">How could Il Jae do this to us?</font>

582
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,620
<font color="yellow">- Auntie.
- He raised a tiger.</font>

583
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,920
<font color="yellow">That means he wants to fight us.</font>

584
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,480
<font color="yellow">That's not why Il Jae helped Gun Woo!</font>

585
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,550
<font color="yellow">Ji Soo, don't try to defend him.</font>

586
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,740
<font color="yellow">He showed me his true colours.</font>

587
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,400
<font color="yellow">What will you do about this?</font>

588
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,280
<font color="yellow">If he wanted to help Gun Woo,</font>

589
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,140
<font color="yellow">he wouldn't have let Gwang Woo out of prison.</font>

590
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,950
<font color="yellow">That's what you think.</font>

591
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,650
<font color="yellow">Il Jae has the blueprint...</font>

592
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,150
<font color="yellow">and he's helping Gun Woo.</font>

593
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,080
<font color="yellow">The vaccine's blueprint.</font>

594
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,680
<font color="yellow">I'll make him give it to you, Gwang Woo.</font>

595
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,920
<font color="yellow">- Father.
- If you'll do that,</font>

596
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,250
<font color="yellow">I can forgive and forget everything that happened.</font>

597
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,210
<font color="yellow">Il Jae found it.</font>

598
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,050
<font color="yellow">- You can't give it...
- He favours Gun Woo!</font>

599
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,880
<font color="yellow">I never liked that!</font>

600
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,910
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

601
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,750
<font color="yellow">This is why blood's thicker than water.</font>

602
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,910
<font color="yellow">A son-in-law can never be true family.</font>

603
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,080
<font color="yellow">We're done.</font>

604
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,280
<font color="yellow">You can all go.</font>

605
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,650
<font color="yellow">I trust that you will help me out.</font>

606
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,180
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Brother.</font>

607
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,410
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

608
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,780
<font color="yellow">You approved of Il Jae's plan at first.</font>

609
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,380
<font color="yellow">What's done is done.</font>

610
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,910
<font color="yellow">Losing those two over Gun Woo...</font>

611
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,080
<font color="yellow">would be just foolish.</font>

612
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,420
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang.</font>

613
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,150
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

614
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,330
<font color="yellow">Why should I give Gwang Woo the blueprint?</font>

615
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,250
<font color="yellow">I explained over the phone.</font>

616
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,890
<font color="yellow">Just do it.</font>

617
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,110
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

618
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,410
<font color="yellow">We have the blueprint,</font>

619
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,980
<font color="yellow">and Gun Woo has the chairman's trust and approval.</font>

620
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,540
<font color="yellow">Why should I help a man Choong likes?</font>

621
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,280
<font color="yellow">We want the same thing. We're just using different tactics.</font>

622
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,280
<font color="yellow">What do you think...</font>

623
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,180
<font color="yellow">Gun Woo will do for you?</font>

624
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,920
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang.</font>

625
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,880
<font color="yellow">He will abandon you.</font>

626
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,650
<font color="yellow">He has his father.</font>

627

628
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,580
<font color="yellow">I won't do as you say.</font>

629
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,260
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

630
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,340
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

631
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,150
<font color="yellow">I will not give Gwang Woo the blueprint.</font>

632
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,750
<font color="yellow">I have made up my mind.</font>

633
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,520
<font color="yellow">Think about it very carefully.</font>

634
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,550
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

635
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,020
<font color="yellow">Where are you, Gun Woo?</font>

636
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,480
<font color="yellow">I'd like to have a drink.</font>

637
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,020
<font color="yellow">My joints ache.</font>

638
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,650
<font color="yellow">I know how you feel about it,</font>

639
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,020
<font color="yellow">but how long must we wait to see Il Jae?</font>

640
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,850
<font color="yellow">I can't even talk to you.</font>

641
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,650
<font color="yellow">I really need to pee.</font>

642
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,310

643
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,810
<font color="yellow">Hide.</font>

644
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,220
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

645
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,040
<font color="yellow">I'm here to tell you something.</font>

646
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,480
<font color="yellow">Are you going to go on about your brother again?</font>

647
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,050
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

648
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,910
<font color="yellow">Maybe you're sick of it,</font>

649
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,250
<font color="yellow">but it breaks my heart.</font>

650
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,450

651
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,080
<font color="yellow">Can't you get over it?</font>

654
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,410
<font color="yellow">with the doctor who did my brother's autopsy?</font>

655
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:45,950
<font color="yellow">If you think...</font>

656
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,180
<font color="yellow">you can use this to frame me for murder,</font>

657
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,480

658
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,380
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

659
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,180
<font color="yellow">You killed my brother.</font>

660
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,510
<font color="yellow">And I will prove it.</font>

661
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,910
<font color="yellow">How dare you come to the wake?</font>

662
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,010
<font color="yellow">Whom were you there for?</font>

663
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,880
<font color="yellow">You're not even human.</font>

664
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,310
<font color="yellow">Don't let it get to you.</font>

665
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,450
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have...</font>

666

668
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,010
<font color="yellow">I will not...</font>

669
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,250
<font color="yellow">forgive you for it.</font>

670
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,750
<font color="yellow">Are you going to betray me for Soo Yeon?</font>

671
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,680
<font color="yellow">Why can't I?</font>

672
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,210
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth.</font>

<font color="yellow">His death will end it all.</font>

787
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,810
<font color="yellow">For you, me and Gi Tan.</font>

788
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,850
<font color="yellow">We'll all be free.</font>

789
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,180
<font color="yellow">And very rich, at that.</font>

790
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,080
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you won't need me?</font>

791
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,610
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine.</font>

792
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,050
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

793
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,450
<font color="yellow">He just left.</font>

794
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:42,950
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

795
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,210
<font color="yellow">He only took one man.</font>

796
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,810
<font color="yellow">We should go.</font>

797
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,150
<font color="yellow">You kept your word.</font>

798
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,910
<font color="yellow">A man's word is equal to his pride.</font>

799
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,050
<font color="yellow">I can't be the one...</font>

800
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,250
<font color="yellow">to bow to you over a deal like this.</font>

801
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,580
<font color="yellow">It's the blueprint saved on my phone.</font>

802
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,580
<font color="yellow">Byun Il Jae has the original document.</font>

803
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,550
<font color="yellow">I got a copy of it.</font>

804
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,910
<font color="yellow">Do you mean that...</font>

805
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,070
<font color="yellow">everything you said is true?</font>

806
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:07,310
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

807
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,250
<font color="yellow">Il Jae killed Professor Na.</font>

808
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:15,210
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to believe you over one photo?</font>

809
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,910
<font color="yellow">Did Yeom Hyeong Gu...</font>

810
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,110
<font color="yellow">frame Gi Tan?</font>

811
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,650
<font color="yellow">He was...</font>

812
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,450
<font color="yellow">in it with Il Jae.</font>

813
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,450
<font color="yellow">If you don't believe us,</font>

814
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,410
<font color="yellow">hear him say so himself.</font>

815
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,380
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

816
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,280
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

817
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,510
<font color="yellow">Hyeong Gu told us everything.</font>

818
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,680
<font color="yellow">Huaping will come after you now.</font>

819
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,780
<font color="yellow">I met him yesterday. You're bluffing.</font>

820
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,380
<font color="yellow">You just wait.</font>

821
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,480
<font color="yellow">I'll make you pay...</font>

822
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,980
<font color="yellow">for killing Professor Na.</font>

823
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,680
<font color="yellow">You might have to watch your back.</font>

824
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,010
<font color="yellow">Now, do you believe me?</font>

825
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,850
<font color="yellow">How dare the likes of him...</font>

826
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,250
<font color="yellow">covet what is mine?</font>

827
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,280
<font color="yellow">He's calling you so brazenly.</font>

828
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,310
<font color="yellow">This will be the last time.</font>

829
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,250
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

830
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,050
<font color="yellow">Today,</font>

831
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,050
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan will die.</font>

832
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,050
<font color="yellow">You want me to clear you of murder...</font>

833
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,580
<font color="yellow">and share the profits of the vaccine.</font>

834
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,180
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

835
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,570
<font color="yellow">I have one condition.</font>

836
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,610
<font color="yellow">I'm listening.</font>

837
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,450
<font color="yellow">I want you to work for me.</font>

838
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,680
<font color="yellow">Do you want me...</font>

839
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,780
<font color="yellow">to become a member of Huaping?</font>

840
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:33,580
<font color="yellow">Not a member.</font>

841
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,510
<font color="yellow">Be my right-hand man.</font>

842
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:40,250
<font color="yellow">The second-in-command.</font>

843
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:17,310
<font color="yellow">(Monster)</font>

844
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,680
<font color="yellow">Don't go, Gi Tan!</font>

845
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,100
<font color="yellow">Please stay.</font>

846
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,910
<font color="yellow">Now, I won't have any more nightmares of Guk Cheol.</font>

847
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:27,040
<font color="yellow">Gi Tan, are you okay?</font>

848
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,410
<font color="yellow">Neither of us can leave.</font>

849
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,830
<font color="yellow">We'll both starve.</font>

850
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,380
<font color="yellow">Did you forget that I have the advantage?</font>

851
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Father. I'm so sorry.</font>

852
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,880
<font color="yellow">It won't be a royal road.</font>

853
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,880
<font color="yellow">It'll be a road of suffering.</font>
