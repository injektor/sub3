00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,830
(Episode 32)

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,670
That woman.

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,870
She's still there.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,700
You're right.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,500
Is something wrong?

6
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,370
Lawyer Oh. Wake up.

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,400
Soo Yeon!

8
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,870
Gi Tan.

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,820
She has a high fever. Let's get her to a hospital.

10
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,870
Get in.

11
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,330
(Do Gun Woo)

12
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,430
(7 Missed Calls)

13
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,770
The police say they don't know.

14
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,530
I filed for missing person,

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,430
but could this be...

16
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,270
Il Jae's doing?

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,570
Why would Lawyer Oh suddenly disappear on us?

18
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,400
Maybe someone kidnapped her.

19
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,170
(Oh Soo Yeon)

20
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,570
Soo Yeon, where did you go?

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,830
It's me, Gi Tan.

22
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,830
I saw that you called her a few times.

23
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,470
What happened?

24
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,670
I saw her fainting as I was passing by.

25
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,830
We're at Hangang Hospital.

26
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,800
You should come and nurse her.

27
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,090
Soo Yeon is at Hangang Hospital.

28
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,460
At a hospital?

29
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,830
Yes. Did you take a taxi? You should come with me.

30
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,600
Okay.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,570
I wonder...

32
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,500
why she was standing there in the rain.

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm not sure.

34
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,100
I think she was waiting for someone.

35
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,100
It must have been Gun Woo.

36
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,800
If it's Gun Woo,

37
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,970
I'm sure she would have picked up.

38
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,330
It's late. We should go, Sir.

39
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,370
Yes. We're on our way right now.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,030
Hangang Hospital is closer to you. You should go first.

41
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,430
Who called you earlier?

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,070
Just an acquaintance.

43
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,030
I'm glad someone she knows found her.

44
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,500
Can we go slower?

45
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,600
What happened to her?

46
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,260
She has a fever, but she should be better by tomorrow.

47
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,570
Thank goodness. I'm glad it's not serious.

48
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,240
I'll stay here. You two can go.

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,670
You don't have to. I can stay.

50
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,490
We can let him take over. Let's go.

51
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,600
- I'm really okay.
 -  Gosh.

52
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,530
- We'll come early tomorrow morning.
 -  Let go of my ear!

53
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,800
(Hangang Hospital)

54
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,030
Oh Soo Yeon!

55
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,470
It was Gi Tan for sure.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Gi Tan...

57
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,770
is alive.

58
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,930
Soo Yeon, are you okay?

59
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,600
Yes.

60
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,100
Who brought me here?

61
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Was it you?

62
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Someone found you while passing by and brought you.

63
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,630
You're up.

64
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,840
Do you know how worried we were?

65
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,130
You must be tired.

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,630
Leave her with me and go to work.

68
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll call you.

69
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,670
Bye.

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Thank you.

71
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,270
You didn't get any sleep because of me.

72
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,800
Take care of yourself.

73
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,270
He is...

74
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,070
a good guy the more I look at him.

75
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,670
Do you know how worried he was yesterday?

76
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,770
I saw Gi Tan yesterday.

77
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,600
Did you have a dream? What are you talking about?

78
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,630
It was really him.

79
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,100
Gosh. It's time for you to let him go.

80
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,700
How long are you going to wait for a dead man?

81
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,570
Gi Tan brought me here.

82
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,270
You make no sense. How can I believe you?

83
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,530
Here is the date schedule to be sent to Chairman K.

84
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,630
Cancel the play and change the dinner location.

85
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,580
Everything needs to be high-quality.

86
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,670
Understood.

87
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,470
Just take the bait, Ga Din.

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
I'll win you over.

89
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,230
Sir.

90
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,130
CEO Do has sent you the date schedule.

91
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,570
- Decline it.
 -  Okay, Sir.

92
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,780
What time is the meeting with the American investors?

93
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,970
You should leave now.

94
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,570
Coward.

95
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,670
What?

96
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,870
You. You're scared of falling in love with me, aren't you?

97
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm busy.

98
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,600
Don't run away and just accept it, you coward.

99
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,270
Don't waste your time.

100
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,470
I will never...

101
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,130
go on a date with you.

102
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,630
I'll make sure you date me. You won't have a choice.

103
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,870
So I was looking over the numbers and I think there's a big problem...

104
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,030
He's in a meeting right now! If you have something...

105
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,130
Hey, Coward.

106
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,230
Are you that scared of me?

107
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,510
Excuse me, what is going on here?

108
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,570
Shut your mouth.

109
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,770
Tell me, you sly coward.

110
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,470
Do you know how much this investment is worth?

111
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,700
How much is it?

112
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,710
I'll just pay you, you coward.

113
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,470
Could someone please just tell me exactly what is...

114
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,930
- Okay. Yes.
 -  going on here?

115
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,730
You! Shut your mouth! Get out!

116
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,170
She's crazy.

117
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,950
This is actually our meeting.

118
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,670
Miss. I don't know what your problem is,

119
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,600
but this is our meeting, so...

120
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,920
You're a coward. You little coward.

121
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,900
Hey! Kang Ga Din!

122
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,400
We sent Shin Young away, so don't worry.

123
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,200
I wish I could report her to the police.

124
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,010
It was so hard making up excuses to the investors.

125
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,630
I'm so embarrassed.

126
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,570
Tell me.

127
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,230
You're scared of falling in love with me, right? You coward!

128
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,370
Shin Young is so persistent.

129
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,630
Sir, you have a fax.

130
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,230
What is it?

131
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,030
CEO Do sent you the date schedule.

132
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,030
I think it's best that you go on a date with her.

133
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
You know her well enough.

134
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,200
She'll latch onto you until you listen to her.

135
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,530
How many times do I have to tell you that he's dining?

136
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,000
My goodness, you can't do this!

137
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,170
My gosh.

138
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,600
How can you eat right now, you coward?

139
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,900
We can eat, grab a drink and watch a movie, right?

140
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,930
Is a week enough?

141
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,300
You'll probably beg for more after a week.

142
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,830
Fine.

143
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,570
Let's go on a date.

144
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,130
- Really?
 -  But I'll schedule it.

145
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,830
I'm all for that.

146
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,500
You have to look good on our date, okay?

147
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,100
You've made a wise decision.

148
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,600
Hey, Soo Yeon.

149
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,630
Why are you back here again?

150
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,550
This is where I first saw Gi Tan.

151
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,670
He's going to come here at least once more.

152
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,100
Okay, let's just say that it was Gi Tan.

153
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,830
If he's really alive,

154
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,070
shouldn't he have contacted you first?

155
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,340
You probably mistook someone for him.

156
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,380
- Don't waste your time here...
 -  My eyes are never wrong.

157
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,800
It really was him.

158
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,700
I know Soo Yeon very well.

159
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,530
It's either one of the two if she insists like that.

160
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,330
She's either awfully ill...

161
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,330
or she really saw him.

162
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,330
Who is this guy who took her to the hospital...

163
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
that day?

164
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,800
You said you know him very well.

165
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,970
It was Gi Tan.

166
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,370
Chairman K, who signed the ship contract with us,

167
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
is Gi Tan.

168
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,410
Why didn't he call Soo Yeon?

169
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,530
There's a problem. He can't remember her.

170
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,170
I'll tell Soo Yeon myself.

171
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,980
I'd appreciate it if you could keep it low for now.

172
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,570
It's not hard to keep quiet,

173
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,430
but will you be okay?

174
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,630
Once she meets Gi Tan,

175
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,570
I think that'll hurt you a lot.

176
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,030
Gi Tan?

177
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,670
Yes.

178
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm pretty sure I saw him.

179
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,470
But it's strange that he hasn't called me.

180
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,200
I've seen someone like him.

181
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,700
- Where?
 -  At a coffee shop.

182
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,870
He looked really similar to Gi Tan, so I thought it was uncanny.

183
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,870
Gi Tan is definitely alive.

184
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,900
What will you do?

185
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,970
I'll wait for him.

186
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,570
What if he never calls?

187
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,070
He will.

188
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,030
There must be a reason why he can't call.

189
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,830
Congresswoman, many people were worried about you.

190
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,770
Will you say a word?

191
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,420
I am sorry to make you worried.

192
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,930
Thanks to everyone's love and support,

193
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,530
I've successfully overcame this attack.

194
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,000
I will return...

195
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,230
your love and support with great policies.

196
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,830
Thank you.

197
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,370
What's Il Jae's current approval rating like?

198
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,450
He's about 10 percent behind the lead.

199
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,300
But we never know what'll happen once Ji Soo steps in.

200
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,930
If Il Jae gets elected as the mayor,

201
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,530
it'll be harder to get my revenge.

202
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,630
We have to make him lose.

203
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,930
Do you have evidence that he staged the attack?

204
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,670
To be honest,

205
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,600
it's difficult to find evidence at the moment.

206
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,030
(Ok Chae Ryung)

207
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,270
We've used up everything we have.

208
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,000
That's why we're flustered.

209
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,300
Il Jae defended all of our attacks and he's still standing strong.

210
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,240
But it's not like we can wait until the election is over.

211
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,830
Il Jae is also very anxious.

212
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,830
That's true.

213
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,610
He doesn't know if he'll be elected.

214
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,070
There is one more thing you can use.

215
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,370
Il Jae will do...

216
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,030
anything to get elected.

217
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,920
You can get him to do something corrupt by himself.

218
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,230
Is that possible?

219
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,670
We must try.

220
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,300
That's the only strategy we have left.

221
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,880
Oddly enough, Il Jae's election...

222
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,530
is all down to you.

223
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,300
Be careful.

224
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,130
I was supposed to be dead, anyway.

225
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,230
Gi Tan saved me.

226
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,200
The least I can do is help him get Il Jae.

227
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,630
You've gone through a lot at the hospital.

228
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,670
You probably suffered more because I wasn't around.

229
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,600
Please, try these.

230
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,830
Ms Ok, please sit.

231
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,030
You can enjoy your family time together. It's been a while.

232
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,730
You did so much for us while Ji Soo was in the hospital.

233
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,470
Please, sit and have a drink.

234
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,900
Yes, take a seat.

235
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,130
To be honest,

236
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,700
I'm very disappointed with you.

237
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,540
Why won't you help Il Jae's election?

238
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Well...

239
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,220
I did give him a supporting speech.

240
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,900
No one knows how this election will turn out.

241
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,040
Can't you step up to the occasion and do something about it?

242
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,200
Il Jae.

243
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,100
Do not think about...

244
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,830
cheating...

245
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,570
for the rest of the election.

246
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,970
What happened?

247
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,540
I met Gi Tan.

248
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
He is...

249
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,630
dying to find our weakness.

250
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,870
If we let him see one,

251
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,300
he will definitely get us.

252
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,430
Gi Tan...

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,330
wants me to lose.

254
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,540
If I lose the election without trying anything,

255
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,330
that's like letting him win.

256
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,170
Il Jae.

257
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,230
If we continue like this,

258
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,800
we have a 50 to 50 chance.

259
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,040
But if we start cheating because we want...

260
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,970
to win the election,

261
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,200
you will definitely lose because of Gi Tan.

262
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,130
Take this to heart.

263
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,830
I didn't know...

264
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,200
you were this afraid...

265
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,130
of Gi Tan.

266
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
What?

267
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,200
I will do the rest of the election my way.

268
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,070
Nothing I do will harm you, so don't worry.

269
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Honey.

270
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,830
Honey!

271
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,430
Let him be.

272
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,040
He may be disappointed for now,

273
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,870
but he'll understand later on.

274
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,170
Your schedule's packed for tomorrow.

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You should stop drinking.

276
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,630
I know my father-in-law very well.

277
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,370
He's not someone who'd be afraid of a scum like Gi Tan.

278
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,070
Then...

279
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,930
why did he say that?

280
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,200
He's trying to be careful.

281
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,520
He doesn't want any harm...

282
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,330
if I lose my election.

283
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,400
He doesn't even care if I become the mayor or not.

284
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,130
I've been looking for you. Your phone was off.

285
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,600
I didn't know it was off.

286
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,100
I have something to tell Mr Byun in private.

287
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,470
Choong Dong, go out.

288
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Sorry?

289
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,270
We need some privacy.

290
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,670
Yes, Sir.

291
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,900
I don't get Congressman Hwang.

292
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,040
He's more than capable of helping you.

293
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,670
That's enough. I want to enjoy my drinks.

294
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,670
What did you want to talk about?

295
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,810
Do you know...

296
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,000
how Congresswoman Hwang won her election?

297
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,200
She didn't have a high approval rating at that time.

298
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,630
Congressman Hwang changed the tables around last minute.

299
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,730
I heard they won over...

300
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,180
the independent candidates to get more votes.

301
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,200
That's right.

302
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,670
The way they did it was so skilful.

303
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,370
Are you telling me...

304
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,200
that you'll reveal his secrets to winning the election?

305
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,030
Yes.

306
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,900
You sure are brave.

307
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,900
How can you bribe an opposing party in broad daylight?

308
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,930
What will you do if I report that painting?

309
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,570
Go ahead.

310
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,630
That painting...

311
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,730
is a fake worth 50 dollars.

312
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,480
But if you sell it to her,

313
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,730
she'll give you...

314
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,470
at least 500,000 dollars in cash.

315
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,400
If you use that strategy, there won't be any troubles later.

316
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,200
You won't have to ask Congressman Hwang for help either.

317
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,100
How interesting.

318
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,900
But there's something we have to prepare before then.

319
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,100
Money and trust.

320
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,570
Trust?

321
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,000
We'll fail if we don't trust each other.

322
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,700
How much do you trust me?

323
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,770
How much should I trust you?

324
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,770
All of it.

325
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,020
You look fantastic today.

326
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,730
I bet Kang Ga Din will fall for you.

327
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,600
Kang Ga Din?

328
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,530
How dare you call him that?

329
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,130
Kang Ga Din.

331
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,730
Go ahead and ask me out.

332
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,730
I'll dump you...

333
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,700
on that day.

334
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,590
Good. You pass with your outfit.

335
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,600
You failed.

336
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,100
I hate people who are late.

337
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,930
I was late while dressing up for you.

338
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,100
I'll try not to be late next time.

339
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,330
Where are we going?

340
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,350
To eat.

341
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,890
I know. Where are we going to eat?

342
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,200
It's somewhere special, so follow me.

343
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,230
Special? Where?

344
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,270
Are we going to Japan for sushi?

345
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm in.

346
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,930
Is this place what you call "special"?

347
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,100
You can leave if you want. I won't stop you.

348
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,630
Not at all. It looks delicious.

349
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,000
You should eat it with kimchi.

350
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,200
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

351
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,200
I won't let you win.

352
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,570
What is it? Is it not good?

353
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,030
It's so good that I might cry.

354
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,200
Why aren't you eating then?

355
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,770
I ate before coming out.

356
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,000
Why is this place special anyway?

357
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,740
I extended my life thanks to their dog's food.

358
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,800
Dog's food?

359
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,640
No wonder. Your tastes are similar.

360
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,630
Don't you believe me? It's true.

361
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,000
Why would I believe that?

362
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,500
What's our next stop?

363
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,200
You wanted to eat, watch a movie and go for drinks.

364
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,200
Let's go watch a movie. What kind of movies do you like?

365
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,600
I like blockbusters.

366
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Exciting action films.

367
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,800
I got tickets for an artistic film. Is that all right?

368
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,600
An artistic film after eating dog food?

369
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,700
Forget it then.

370
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,530
No way. I love art.

371
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,270
Wake me up when it's done.

372
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,400
Hey, watch your manners.

373
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,630
I've watched this already. I came here for you.

374
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,400
Crazy jerk.

375
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,800
Are you talking about me?

376
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,030
That male lead is crazy.

377
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,630
I thought you were mad at me.

378
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,900
No way, this is so much fun.

379
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,270
Do you want to lean on my shoulder?

380
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,870
No thanks.

381
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,800
Keep it in.

382
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,500
Just think about the day you'll take revenge on him.

383
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Are you crazy?

384
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,100
The main character just died.

385
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,370
Why did you laugh then?

386
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,500
Keep it down over there.

387
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,800
Where should we go now?

388
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,670
For drinks.

389
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,370
What do you like to drink?

390
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,570
I'm not sure.

391
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,500
How about some wine at some place classy?

392
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,230
Have you tried soju before?

393
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,870
Of course not, you punk.

394
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,530
It's my favourite kind of drink.

395
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,230
What about pork skin?

396
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,270
I never knew this was edible.

397
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,800
I can't get enough of it.

398
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,030
Cheers.

399
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,770
Let's drink with bigger glasses.

400
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,300
You didn't eat anything all day. Are you sure about that?

401
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,200
Forget it if you can't handle it.

402
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,200
It was you who suggested it.

403
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,400
Here.

404
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,100
Bottoms up.

405
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,930
You're falling. Fall.

406
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,770
Did you fall in love yet?

407
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
You did.

408
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,200
You're making me dizzy.

409
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,630
I'm putting a spell on you.

410
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,630
You have to fall in love with me.

411
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,670
Don't do something so useless.

412
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,270
You smiled for the first time.

413
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,200
Kang Ga Din.

414
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,900
Did you finally fall for my charms?

415
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,430
I think that's enough. We should go. I'll get this.

416
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,770
What?

417
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,600
Did you drink?

418
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,740
I had soju. Why?

419
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,600
You can't drink soju.

420
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,400
You've never had it before.

421
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,900
Be quiet. Goodbye.

422
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,500
You can't get drunk. Do you understand, Ma'am?

423
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,000
Hello? Hello?

424
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,700
It looks like she's already drunk. This is bad.

425
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,230
What's wrong? Can't she drink?

426
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,230
She gets very odd when she's drunk.

427
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,100
What do you mean? What does she do?

428
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,500
There are a few steps.

429
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,000
First, she begins to fight.

430
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,170
Hey, do you want to die?

431
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,990
Hey. You with the slit eyes!

432
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,690
What's wrong with you?

433
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,070
I'm sorry, my sister is too drunk.

434
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,160
Don't be sorry!

435
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,250
He glared at me first!

436
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,800
Open your eyes. Open them!

437
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,770
Are you kidding me?

438
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,330
- What are you trying to do?
 -  Open your eyes!

439
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,970
- They are fully open!
 -  They are!

440
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,670
- I'm so sorry.
 -  I'll show you my eyes!

441
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,870
- Okay.
 -  Open your eyes!

442
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,170
- I did open them!
 -  Please, stop.

443
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,630
- Where are you going?
 -  I did open my eyes!

444
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,530
After that, she gets very cheerful.

445
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,970
Kang Ga Din, run. Run!

446
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,600
Giddy up!

447
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,970
Run! Run to the end of the Earth!

448
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,070
Let's go!

449
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,500
I guess he can deal with her that far.

450
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,800
The problem begins now.

451
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,870
Hey!

452
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,750
She bites?

453
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,770
Yes. Her pet dog was also bitten by her once.

454
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,200
After that,

455
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,530
she begins to cry.

456
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,230
Everyone hates me.

457
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Why?

458
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,570
Because they all envy me.

459
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,300
I am too good for them!

460
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,800
Why did I have to be so pretty?

461
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,870
I haven't gotten any friends.

462
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,000
I will settle this once and for all.

463
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,400
It's because of your personality.

464
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
Kang Ga Din.

465
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,130
You can't leave me, okay?

466
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,700
I'm going to kill you if you betray me.

467
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,060
Okay. There, there. Stop crying.

468
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,170
Let's go home.

469
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,030
Stop crying and let's go home.

470
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,870
Simply put,

471
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,530
she is the worst drunk on Earth.

472
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,800
(Dodo Group)

473
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,230
Why don't you say hello?

474
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,180
You have a very stiff neck.

475
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,600
Why would I do that?

476
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,250
You started to speak rather casually to me.

477
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,630
If you don't treat me like a brother, treat me like staff.

478
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,680
I'm the CEO of headquarters.

479
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,500
We have different bloodlines.

480
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,900
You're fake, but I am from an original bloodline.

481
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,880
Look forward to this general shareholders' meeting.

482
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,970
What should I look forward for?

483
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,510
Are you trying to fire me once Father gets reinstated?

484
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,900
I will do that. There are way too many parasites in this company.

485
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,900
Parasites?

486
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,000
You haven't seen a real parasite, have you?

487
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,630
Your mum.

488
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Do you know how she was?

489
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,500
When I was young, I thought she was an angel.

490
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,270
She was much nicer than my mum and she loved me.

491
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
But...

492
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,270
that same woman took my father and my everything.

493
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,170
You call...

494
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,700
someone like that a parasite.

495
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,800
Someone like your mum. Do you understand?

496
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,000
Do not speak ill...

497
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,880
of the deceased.

498
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,490
Do I have to forgive her because she's dead?

499
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,500
Who says so?

500
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,500
You can say whatever you want.

501
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,500
After the general meeting,

502
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,770
you won't be able to keep your head up in front of me.

503
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,600
I really despise him.

504
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,700
Why are you so late?

505
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,490
It's almost time for Choong to come back after his workout.

506
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,980
I'm sorry. I received the medication a little too late.

507
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,370
Fill them up.

508
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,400
Yes, Ma'am.

509
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,530
Those are fake pills for his blood pressure, right?

510
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,230
Yes, they are just health supplements.

511
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,090
Did he use up all of the pills he brought from Australia?

512
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,500
That's why I'm filling them up with health supplements.

513
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,270
He was overly healthy because of those pills.

514
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,800
I see.

515
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,420
This is a secret from Gwang Woo and Shin Young, okay?

516
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,440
Of course, Chairwoman.

517
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,440
But will it be all right?

518
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,890
Dr Hwang once said if he collapses again,

519
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,500
he may not ever get back up.

520
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,300
You do not have to be worried about that.

521
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,630
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
You may go.

523
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,000
He practically asked for it.

524
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,070
Why did he dream of returning?

525
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Mum, Gun Woo said he'll fire me to my face.

526
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,200
How can you play the piano?

527
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,500
Don't worry. Your father will never get reinstated.

528
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,900
Did you finally find a way around this?

529
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,100
It's not good to have a rotten tree around.

530
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,400
You must root it out...

531
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,630
without hesitation.

532
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,900
What are you saying? Is Father the rotten tree?

533
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,790
Then is he a healthy one? He's always sick.

534
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,770
Stop beating around the bush. What's your plan?

535
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,400
You can leave it up to me.

536
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,270
Take a look at this.

537
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,370
Who's this? Her credentials are amazing.

538
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,630
She's the second daughter of Seogang Group. What do you think?

539
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,630
Forget about it.

540
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,530
It was really hard for me when I got my divorce.

541
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,670
Be quiet. Marriage is a part of business.

542
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,200
Give it a thought.

543
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,000
Marriage?

544
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,200
Welcome home, Honey.

545
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,400
Oh, okay.

546
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,170
What's okay?

547
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,100
What? It's nothing. Nothing at all.

548
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,170
My gosh, what's wrong with me?

549
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Yes, Father.

550
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,070
We're almost there.

551
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,000
Okay.

552
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,030
Where were you last night?

553
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,700
I couldn't reach your phone.

554
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
To be honest,

555
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,630
I saw Gi Tan...

556
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,200
the day I was hospitalised.

557
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,970
You don't have to believe me.

558
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,440
I was at the place where I saw...

559
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,500
Do you...

560
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,170
miss him that much?

561
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,500
Hey, Soo Yeon, to be honest...

562
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,170
Let's talk about something else.

563
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,000
Why is Chairman suddenly changing his will?

564
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,580
Tell them you're the company's lawyer. They'll let you in.

565
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,700
Aren't you coming?

566
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I can't...

567
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,900
enter this house.

568
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,600
Let go.

569
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,000
He will see me.

570
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,630
Are you sure about this?

571
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,700
Let go.

572
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,570
Gun Woo.

573
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,630
Father.

574
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,470
Hello. I'm Oh Soo Yeon, Dodo Group's legal counsel.

575
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,770
Hello. Thanks for coming over.

576
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,100
Come inside.

577
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,830
- Father!
 -  Sir!

578
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,770
I'm fine.

579
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,300
I'm just tired because I exercised a bit too much.

580
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,300
When did he get so bad?

581
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,830
This is actually a huge improvement from...

582
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,900
- Don't say such nonsense!
 -  I'm sorry, Sir.

583
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,200
I'm fine. Don't worry.

584
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,510
You should've told me you weren't well.

585
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,470
You're making me look bad.

586
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,000
You're busy with work.

587
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,940
I don't want you to worry about me, too.

588
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,730
Without you,

589
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
the company means nothing.

590
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,570
I want to be around you for a long, long time.

591
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,670
So please look after yourself.

592
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:32,770
I guess...

593
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,370
not everything about my life was a total waste.

594
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,570
At least one member of my family likes me.

595
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,700
- Let's go inside.
 -  No.

596
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,200
I have to go.

597
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,830
Help him as best as you can.

598
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,610
I will.

599
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,270
Go back to work, then.

600
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,670
(Land Registry)

601
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,170
I don't know exactly...

602
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,570
how much I have.

603
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,600
To revise your will, we'll need to update your list of assets.

604
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,100
That's right.

605
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,900
That will take a lot of time.

606
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,270
Also,

607
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,270
find a way to get back the assets...

608
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,370
I gave to my wife and Gwang Woo.

609
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,400
- Pardon?
 -  I want...

610
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,300
to get back everything I gave to those two.

611
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,400
Yes, Sir. I'll look for a way.

612
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,400
Dinner is ready.

613
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,270
Do you prepare the meals yourself?

614
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:02,440
Did you have to come in wearing that? You're embarrassing me, too.

615
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,030
I apologise.

616
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,640
Come downstairs and eat.

617
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,100
I'm not hungry. You can eat alone.

618
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,920
You skipped lunch and exercised.

619
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,490
I shouldn't have eaten that patjuk.

620
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,970
It ruined my appetite.

621
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,530
Do you want patjuk?

622
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,580
I'm good at making it.

623
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,930
Forget it. Nothing beats the patjuk my wife makes.

624
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,030
Can I use the kitchen?

625
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,360
I said, forget it.

626
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,900
CEO Do told me to serve you well.

627
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,400
I won't be long.

628
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,100
- Go and help her.
 -  Yes, Sir.

629
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,200
I don't eat what doesn't suit my taste.

630
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,300
Don't take it personally.

631
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,770
I won't. Please try some.

632
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
How is it?

633
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,700
Is it not good?

634
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,830
I'm sorry. I hadn't made it in a while.

635
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,390
- It's delicious.
 -  Sorry?

636
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:18,600
It's fantastic.

637
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:22,500
My wife's patjuk is nothing compared to this.

638
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,980
The little dumplings are great, too.

639
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,370
- Are they good, too?
 -  Yes.

640
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,200
Eat all you want.

641
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,830
We're here...

642
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,400
What are you doing here?

643
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,770
What's going on?

644
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,730
What's this patjuk?

645
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,400
He craved it, so I cooked some for him.

646
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,300
Do you know how to make this?

647
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,830
You're his legal counsel.

648
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,370
Are you here to cook?

649
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,830
How dare you interrupt my meal?

650
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,100
So...

651
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,030
do you like the patjuk someone else made for you?

652
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,730
What you made wasn't the real thing.

653
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,000
It's delicious.

654
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,400
Some lies fall apart right away.

655
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,400
No one can beat your patjuk. You used to sell it.

656
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,170
Let's see.

657
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,900
It's really good.

658
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,730
It's not tasty at all. It's bitter.

659
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,300
No. Your patjuk really isn't the real...

660
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,600
It's bitter.

661
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,400
Everything you do rubs me the wrong way.

662
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,830
Lawyer Oh, once I finish this bowl, I'll have another.

663
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,770
Sure. You can have as much as you want.

664
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,000
- Me, too.
 -  Sure.

665
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,500
What are you doing?

666
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,080
What are you doing here?

667
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,100
I'm here as the legal counsel.

668
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,830
To give your father some advice.

669
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,100
Really?

670
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,370
You.

671
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,630
Do you want to have some wine with me?

672
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,900
- No. I have to go.
 -  Come on.

673
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,400
Why are you in such a rush?

674
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,800
Your job here's done.

675
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:39,830
Do you know that...

676
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,000
Gun Woo's going on a blind date?

677
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,470
No.

678
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,000
He's going to marry someone else.

679
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,900
Do you mind?

680
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,800
What does that have to do with me?

681
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:58,000
I thought you'd given up on trying to get back at Il Jae...

682
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,900
and had decided to stick to Gun Woo instead.

683
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,530
Can I leave?

684
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
What about me?

685
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,100
How do you mean?

686
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
I mean...

687
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:13,100
What do you think of me as a prospective husband?

688
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,030
Think about it seriously.

689
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,690
You betrayed me twice, but I still can't stop you...

690
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,200
from zooming about in my head.

691
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,470
Anyway,

692
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,300
I keep thinking of you.

693
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,550
This is a first for me, too, so I'm very perplexed.

694
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,170
No. Will that do?

695
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,510
Think about it before you answer.

696
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:46,770
Take some time.

697
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,100
Thoughtfully and slowly.

698
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,200
I'll think about it all I want and reach the same conclusion.

699
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,300
So don't ever mention this again.

700
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,440
It's torture.

701
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,100
Why? Why can't it be me?

702
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,830
I love someone else.

703
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,930
She's in love?

704
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,300
When did she meet the guy?

705
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,930
Nothing works my way.

706
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,170
Seriously.

707
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,170
These are the independent candidates who are out of the running.

708
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,290
You're second within the error range,

709
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,300
so if just one of them supports you,

710
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,630
you will win the election.

711
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,170
Who's the target?

712
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,300
Number six.

713
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,200
He has the least amount of assets,

714
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:49,000
and although he was acquitted, when he was head of a borough,

715
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,930
he was investigated for bribery.

716
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,930
Are you suggesting...

717
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,830
we buy his support?

718
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,600
This is what Mr Hwang is against.

719
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,500
The timing...

720
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,360
We ran the simulation.

721
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,440
There will be no trace, so don't worry.

722
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,530
What will you do...

723
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:13,170
if this becomes a problem later on?

724
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,090
What will you do if Mr Byun loses by a tiny margin?

725
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,470
I can risk my life!

726
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,700
But...

727
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,430
you can run away.

728
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,200
I give up, then.

729
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,700
If we can't trust each other,

730
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,400
this plan will fail.

731
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:35,800
Stop it, Choong Dong.

732
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,330
Sir, as your loyal assistant...

733
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:43,800
I make the decisions. You just follow them.

734
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,070
Why are you acting up all of a sudden?

735
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,330
I apologise.

736
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Chae Ryung, loosen up.

737
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,800
The results of this election are in your hands.

738
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:01,770
If this goes sideways, it's on you for jinxing it.

739
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,300
- What?
 -  That's enough.

740
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,170
We have a plan. Put it into motion.

741
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,230
Okay.

742
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,390
This vase costs 10 dollars.

743
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:27,300
I'll put a 20-dollar bouquet in it.

744
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,170
That's 30 dollars altogether.

745
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,400
It's not enough to cancel anyone's election.

746
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,600
Understood?

747
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,430
You all did well today.

748
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,800
Welcome back.

749
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,510
What's this?

750
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,400
It's from a supporter.

751
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It's pretty.

752
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,480
Candidate number six, Cho Cham speaking.

753
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,870
I'm with Mingook Daily. I'd like to interview you.

754
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:12,630
I'm free right now.

755
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:14,970
I have an hour.

756
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,000
Yes. I'll see you there.

757
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,070
- Mr Cho.
 -  Ms Park.

758
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,500
I'm Park Young Ji.

759
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,800
- Come inside.
 -  Sure.

760
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,530
Welcome, Mr Cho.

761
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:35,300
Mr Byun.

762
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:37,900
Why are you here?

763
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,900
Please, have a seat.

764
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,170
(Moon Tae Gwang)

765
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:06,970
It's me.

766
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,600
The countdown has begun.

767
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,140
Do you want me to pack up and support you?

768
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,900
Your approval rating is 10 percent.

769
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,600
You'll never get elected.

770
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,500
But if you make the right choice,

771
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,900
that 10 percent can be of great use...

772
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,800
to the both of us.

773
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,530
You know I'll refuse.

774
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,800
Will two million dollars do?

775
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,700
I think that's a decent amount.

776
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,370
People like you still exist.

777
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:45,480
I thought you truly cared for the people.

778
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,400
I'll give 2.5 million dollars. Take it or leave it.

779
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,330
I will not quit my campaign unless it is to ensure that...

780
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,600
you don't get elected.

781
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,470
You've already accepted...

782
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:58,500
the 2.5 million dollars.

783
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,900
The vase on your table.

784
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,870
That's worth 2.5 million dollars.

785
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,500
You scumbag.

786
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,400
Will he do what we want?

787
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,500
He'll get back to us...

788
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:27,630
when he sees the vase.

789
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,000
- Hello, this is...
 -  Mr Cho?

790
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,800
I forgot to tell you something.

791
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:04,400
Don't report the vase to the police.

792
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,600
It's only worth 10 dollars and you'll be mocked over it.

793
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,400
Take the vase to a store in Insadong...

794
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,600
and they'll buy it for 2.5 million.

795
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,070
You gain a lump sum without leaving a trace.

796
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,200
If you're not up for it, smash the vase.

797
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,630
I can do without 10 dollars.

798
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,870
You have until 3pm to get back to me.

799
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,100
It's past 3pm.

800
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,430
I think this means no.

801
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,330
Mr Cho. I'm listening.

802
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:43,870
That vase.

803
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,170
I smashed it.

804
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,800
If that is your decision,

805
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,770
I feel sorry for you.

806
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:58,630
Could you...

807
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,170
send me another vase?

808
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,770
Of course I can get another one.

809
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,870
You made the right decision.

810
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,430
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

811
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,430
after the beep...

812
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:35,580
It's me. I can't reach Soo Yeon.

813
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,600
The thing is...

814
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,100
She's there again.

815
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,270
The place where she saw Gi Tan.

816
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:45,370
Okay.

817
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,600
I'm looking for someone. Thank you.

818
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,900
Call me if you see this man.

819
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,270
(Kang Gi Tan)

820
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,770
You'll catch him making a deal?

821
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,520
One half has taken the bait.

822
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,070
We can get them both if we pull at the right time.

823
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,700
Who is your contact in Il Jae's camp?

824
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,400
I'll tell you that later.

825
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:55,970
It's me.

826
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,770
- What do you want?
 -  Let's meet up this evening.

827
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,970
I haven't received the order yet.

828
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,330
- If this is about the contract...
 -  It's not about the ship.

829
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:07,160
Then I don't see why else we should meet.

830
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,200
At 7pm.

831
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,630
See you at Dodo Hotel's cafe.

832
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,770
Why does Gun Woo want to see you?

833
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,230
I don't know.

834
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,700
Have you seen this man?

835
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,700
Have you seen this man? Call me at this number.

836
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,630
Gun Woo.

837
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,430
Will it take long? Can I help?

838
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,400
No. I'm almost done.

839
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,370
I'm meeting Chairman K at 7pm.

840
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,740
- Today?
 -  Yes.

841
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,370
Come to the cafe in Dodo Hotel. I'll see you there.

842
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,600
Okay.

843
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:23,900
Shin Young.

844
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,170
Why haven't you...

845
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,270
Let's get a drink some time.

846
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,970
How can I ever see him again? I'm so embarrassed!

847
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,200
I'm here. Where are you?

848
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,200
I think I'll be a bit late.

849
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:00,630
Meet up with Chairman K and stall for a while.

850
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:02,530
Okay.

851
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,070
How will I know who he is?

852
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:07,570
They know you.

853
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,900
Okay. Don't be too late.

854
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,100
Who is K?

855
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,970
I'm sorry.

856
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,800
It's her again.

857
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,670
Gi Tan.

858
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,570
I knew you'd be alive.

859
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:22,470
How do you...

860
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,530
know my name?

861
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,600
Gi Tan.
