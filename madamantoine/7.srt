3
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:18,521
<font color="signal">Oh my god!</font>

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,221
<font color="signal">Who... the hell are you?</font>

5
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,920
<font color="signal">Let go of that hand right now!</font>

6
00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:29,978
<font color="signal">- Mr. Soo Hyun?
- Professor Choi?</font>

7
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:31,579
<font color="signal">Let's go!</font>

8
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,579
<font color="signal">Professor Choi!</font>

9
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:39,978
<font color="signal">What are you trying to do here?</font>

10
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,478
<font color="signal">You two know each other?</font>

11
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,079
<font color="signal"><i>[Episode 7]</i>
How do you know Professor Jo?</font>

12
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,630
<font color="signal">We're just acquaintances, but he
has a lot of interest in fortune telling.</font>

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,630
<font color="signal">That's the only reason
I introduced him to you.</font>

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,430
<font color="signal">All you did was introduce him to me?</font>

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,129
<font color="signal">Then why did he ask me out on a date?</font>

16
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,530
<font color="signal">How am I supposed to know?</font>

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,230
<font color="signal">I guess his ideal type
is fortune tellers.</font>

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,129
<font color="signal">Then, why did you chase us?</font>

19
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:18,730
<font color="signal">I was afraid that you might
fall for Professor Jo</font>

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,930
<font color="signal">since he's so handsome
and chivalrous.</font>

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,030
<font color="signal">But you decided to go on a date with him
within a day of meeting him?</font>

22
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,829
<font color="signal">How could you be so... fickle?</font>

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,829
<font color="signal">Why?
Why can't I see other men?</font>

24
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,030
<font color="signal">Are the two of us in a relationship?
Did we ever go out, or anything?</font>

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,030
<font color="signal">No, we didn't!
So what business of yours is it?</font>

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,129
<font color="signal">Don't you remember?
I clearly told you that I like--</font>

27
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,629
<font color="signal">Oh. You mean what you told me
while sending me those flowers?</font>

28
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:44,430
<font color="signal">I didn't realize
that was actually genuine.</font>

29
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,930
<font color="signal">I thought you were just messing around.</font>

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,829
<font color="signal">Who would mess around
with something like that?</font>

31
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:48,829
<font color="signal">Oh, really?</font>

32
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,629
<font color="signal">Then I'll give it to you straight now.</font>

33
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,930
<font color="signal">My answer is "no."</font>

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,930
<font color="signal">It's not because I'm mad</font>

35
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,430
<font color="signal">or because of your excessive jealously,
or because I'm giving up.</font>

36
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,730
<font color="signal">It's just a sincere "no."</font>

37
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,030
<font color="signal">I don't have any feelings for you
whatsoever.</font>

38
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,830
<font color="signal">Ms. Hye Rim. There are times when humans
are not aware of their true feelings.</font>

39
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,430
<font color="signal">The way I see it, you're in that--</font>

40
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,729
<font color="signal">Also, I have some work that came up.</font>

41
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,629
<font color="signal">I'll become quite busy from here on out.</font>

42
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,629
<font color="signal">What kind of work?</font>

43
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,530
<font color="signal">Are you saying that some kind
of project came in, or something?</font>

44
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,530
<font color="signal">Yes. I've been tasked with being
a part of efforts</font>

45
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,530
<font color="signal">improving international
relations with China</font>

46
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,530
<font color="signal">as well as the unification
of North and South Korea</font>

47
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,729
<font color="signal">and achieving world peace.</font>

48
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,129
<font color="signal">So representatives from all these
countries will be meeting in one spot?</font>

49
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,530
<font color="signal">That's really none of your business.</font>

50
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,229
<font color="signal">Anyway, I'll be busy because of all this</font>

51
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,729
<font color="signal">so I don't think I'll even be able
to see your face anymore.</font>

52
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,129
<font color="signal">Goodbye, Mr. Choi Soo Hyun.</font>

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,629
<font color="signal">Can I have the check, please?</font>

54
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,830
<font color="signal">I came to reclaim what I left here.
(in French)</font>

55
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,129
<font color="signal">The clothes have been ruined.
(in French)</font>

56
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,229
<font color="signal">It wasn't like this at first.
(in French)</font>

57
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,030
<font color="signal">I'm telling you there's a date tomorrow!
(in French)</font>

58
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,629
<font color="signal">Take responsibility!
(in French)</font>

59
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,229
<font color="signal">What, is it something bad?</font>

60
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,030
<font color="signal">No, that's not it, but...</font>

61
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,030
<font color="signal">I'll give you a little extra, so
please try to convince that French lady!</font>

62
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,229
<font color="signal">Please?</font>

63
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,430
<font color="signal"><i>50,000 won.</i></font>

64
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,430
<font color="signal"><i>This money is the same as four hours
worth of part-time work</i></font>

65
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,930
<font color="signal"><i>and could pay for three containers
of sugar syrup!</i></font>

66
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,229
<font color="signal">Is that not enough?</font>

67
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,129
<font color="signal">Would you like a bit more?</font>

68
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,030
<font color="signal">Um... it's not something that can
be solved by trying to convince her.</font>

69
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,030
<font color="signal">All she's doing is telling you
what'll happen in the future.</font>

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,830
<font color="signal">She said that it's important
to respect your child's opinion.</font>

71
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,129
<font color="signal">Marie Antoinette went through
something similar, you see.</font>

72
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,229
<font color="signal">She didn't want to get married</font>

73
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,830
<font color="signal">but her mother forced her to
get married to a French royal.</font>

74
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,330
<font color="signal">And thus, that ultimately
led to her demise.</font>

75
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,030
<font color="signal">Yes... I did force my child to major
in medicine when they didn't want to.</font>

76
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,729
<font color="signal">See? And his grades weren't
that good either, because of that.</font>

77
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,629
<font color="signal">It's his life.
Please respect his opinions.</font>

78
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,430
<font color="signal">How much did you say your fee was?</font>

79
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,930
<font color="signal">With a base price of 50,000 won
and travel fees of 50,000 won</font>

80
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,329
<font color="signal">it's 100,000 won in total, ma'am.</font>

81
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,730
<font color="signal">There were some tiny errors
this time around. I apologize.</font>

82
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,730
<font color="signal">What kind of errors, exactly?</font>

83
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,529
<font color="signal">That's confidential, so I can't
volunteer that information.</font>

84
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,029
<font color="signal">Why did you say, "get your hands off her"
when you appeared suddenly?</font>

85
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,230
<font color="signal">Very rudely, at that.</font>

86
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,529
<font color="signal">My experiment does not allow for the
subjects to touch each other.</font>

87
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:46,430
<font color="signal">I know that you did it as a
defensive maneuver to protect Ms. Go</font>

88
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,930
<font color="signal">but I had to stop that as quickly
as possible, through any means necessary.</font>

89
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,430
<font color="signal">And I'm still sorry about the fact
that I spoke to you so disrespectfully.</font>

90
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,029
<font color="signal">It seems that the liberal arts
are quite complicated.</font>

91
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,730
<font color="signal">The natural sciences are much easier,
with everything being calculable.</font>

92
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,329
<font color="signal">Anyway, have you heard
from Ms. Go Hye Rim?</font>

93
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,829
<font color="signal">She's been texting me, asking to see me
since this morning.</font>

94
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,629
<font color="signal">She's trying to confirm her suspicions.</font>

95
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:14,930
<font color="signal">She's realized that the two of
us know each other, which is why.</font>

96
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,730
<font color="signal">If you do meet her,
please tell her this.</font>

97
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,129
<font color="signal">Welcome!</font>

98
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:39,930
<font color="signal">I'll get straight to the point.</font>

99
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,930
<font color="signal">What kind of relationship do
you have with Mr. Choi Soo Hyun?</font>

100
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,629
<font color="signal">We're just acquaintances.</font>

101
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,430
<font color="signal">And the reason I met you</font>

102
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,730
<font color="signal">is because I asked him to recommend
a good fortune teller to me.</font>

103
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,829
<font color="signal">I heard that you were a
professor of mechanical engineering.</font>

104
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:53,029
<font color="signal">I didn't know people in the sciences
believed in fortune telling.</font>

105
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,430
<font color="signal">That's just my personal preference.</font>

106
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,629
<font color="signal">But, why did you go with
Mr. Choi that day?</font>

107
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,430
<font color="signal">Go on the offensive. Ask her why
she went with Choi Soo Hyun.</font>

108
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,930
<font color="signal">I'm the one who asked to see you.</font>

109
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,730
<font color="signal">Did our date mean nothing to you?</font>

110
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,430
<font color="signal">That's because I had to talk to
Mr. Choi about something...</font>

111
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,230
<font color="signal">You could've done that later, though.</font>

112
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,230
<font color="signal">It was kind of an urgent scenario, so...</font>

113
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,230
<font color="signal">I'm disappointed.</font>

114
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:30,029
<font color="signal">I never would've expected you
to be such a person.</font>

115
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,230
<font color="signal">I am sorry about that.</font>

116
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,029
<font color="signal">But how did you get to know Mr. Soo Hyun?</font>

117
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,529
<font color="signal">I told you.</font>

118
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,329
<font color="signal">I've taken on a project that
is relevant to psychology--</font>

119
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,430
<font color="signal">Mr. Choi is from Stanford and
you're from Dong Ah University.</font>

120
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,430
<font color="signal">So how did you two...</font>

121
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,029
<font color="signal">I'm saying that the two of us
are working together on this project.</font>

122
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,829
<font color="signal">And what's the objective
of this project?</font>

123
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:47,629
<font color="signal">To find out more about
a woman's way of thinking.</font>

124
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,430
<font color="signal">Professor Choi is supervising
and participating in an experiment</font>

125
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,730
<font color="signal">related to female psychology, so...</font>

126
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,329
<font color="signal">An experiment regarding
female psychology?</font>

127
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,529
<font color="signal">He's supervising and even participating
in such an experiment?</font>

128
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,730
<font color="signal">How strange.</font>

129
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,329
<font color="signal">What did I do to deserve this?</font>

130
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,629
<font color="signal">I'm the one who was rendered
a fool by you two</font>

131
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,029
<font color="signal">so why are you treating me this way?</font>

132
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,430
<font color="signal">I don't get it.</font>

133
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,930
<font color="signal">I'll be excusing myself now.</font>

134
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,029
<font color="signal">He's both supervising and participating
in the experiment?</font>

135
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,930
<font color="signal"><i>Currently, the experiment is in
quite a dangerous state.</i></font>

136
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,129
<font color="signal"><i>Due to Subject A, which is me,
having acted brashly</i></font>

137
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,129
<font color="signal"><i>the subject, Go Hye Rim,
has made a declaration of farewell.</i></font>

138
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:40,029
<font color="signal"><i>If things keep progressing this way,
my hypothesis will not be proven true.</i></font>

139
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,629
<font color="signal"><i>It's commonly said that a woman's "no"
is similar to her "yes".</i></font>

140
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,129
<font color="signal"><i>However, that is completely false.</i></font>

141
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:59,129
<font color="signal"><i>One must gauge the true meaning
behind a woman's words</i></font>

142
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,329
<font color="signal"><i>while taking the circumstances
into account.</i></font>

143
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,329
<font color="signal"><i>If that is the case, what are
Ms. Go Hye Rim's circumstances?</i></font>

144
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:09,529
<font color="signal">It's not because I'm mad, or your
jealously, or because I'm giving up.</font>

145
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,930
<font color="signal">It's just a sincere "no."</font>

146
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,930
<font color="signal"><i>The fact that she said something
like that is a significant sign.</i></font>

147
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,430
<font color="signal"><i>In reality, she could've said no because</i></font>

148
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,029
<font color="signal"><i>she became angry and wanted to
trigger jealously in me to test me.</i></font>

149
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,430
<font color="signal"><i>Therefore, rather than
making uncalculated moves</i></font>

150
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,329
<font color="signal"><i>more data collection regarding the
subject takes precedence at this point.</i></font>

151
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,629
<font color="signal">Yes, Professor Choi.
Hello.</font>

152
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:37,929
<font color="signal">Yes, hello, Ms. Yoo Rim.</font>

153
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,429
<font color="signal">Are you available to talk right now?</font>

154
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,330
<font color="signal">I have something to ask you,
you see.</font>

155
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,429
<font color="signal">Ms. Hye Rim seems busy as of late.</font>

156
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,230
<font color="signal">Did something happen?</font>

157
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,029
<font color="signal">Oh... yes, but...</font>

158
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,029
<font color="signal"><i>If it's something complicated,
you don't need to tell me.</i></font>

159
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,330
<font color="signal">But we're neighbors.</font>

160
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,429
<font color="signal">She's just busy because of work,
is all.</font>

161
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:56,929
<font color="signal"><i>It's not easy to pay
for a child's tuition.</i></font>

162
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:57,929
<font color="signal">Oh, yes.</font>

163
00:08:57,929 --> 00:08:59,929
<font color="signal">You studied abroad, right?</font>

164
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,230
<font color="signal">How much does it cost for a high school
student studying in London?</font>

165
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,429
<font color="signal">Well, things are
more expensive in London</font>

166
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,629
<font color="signal">so it'll probably be at least  2 million
won per month, not including tuition.</font>

167
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:08,730
<font color="signal">Why?</font>

168
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,529
<font color="signal">Oh... It's nothing.</font>

169
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,629
<font color="signal"><i>Studying abroad in London?</i></font>

170
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,730
<font color="signal"><i>Is she tight on funds
because of Do Kyung?</i></font>

171
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,730
<font color="signal">- Here you are.
- Thank you.</font>

172
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:25,029
<font color="signal">- Thank you! Goodbye!
- Yes! Goodbye!</font>

173
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,429
<font color="signal">Ms. Hye Rim.</font>

174
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,830
<font color="signal">How much is it
to rent this place out for a night?</font>

175
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,629
<font color="signal">Why?
What's the occasion?</font>

176
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:40,129
<font color="signal">I'm having a get-together with
some people I know</font>

177
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:41,529
<font color="signal">and I was thinking that I'd
like to have it here.</font>

178
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,230
<font color="signal">No.
Find somewhere else.</font>

179
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,429
<font color="signal">It'll be a small cocktail party.</font>

180
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:47,730
<font color="signal">About 3 million won
should cover it, right?</font>

181
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,830
<font color="signal"><i>3 million won?</i></font>

182
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,529
<font color="signal"><i>No... even 2 million won
would be more than enough.</i></font>

183
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,629
<font color="signal">Does it... cost more than that?
3.5 million, then?</font>

184
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,129
<font color="signal">I'm sorry, but I pick and choose
my customers.</font>

185
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,629
<font color="signal">Your guests aren't welcome here.</font>

186
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,429
<font color="signal">So, considering the factor that they're
my friends, I'll give you 4 million.</font>

187
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:06,629
<font color="signal">That's fine, right?</font>

188
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:10,230
<font color="signal"><i>With that much, I could pay for 2 months
of Do Kyung's living expenses in London.</i></font>

189
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,830
<font color="signal"><i>No. If I'm too greedy,
karma will bite me back later.</i></font>

190
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,929
<font color="signal">I don't know. If you're so desperate...</font>

191
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:18,929
<font color="signal">How about... 2.5 million?</font>

192
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:22,929
<font color="signal">You have to prepare canapes
and champagne, so won't you need more?</font>

193
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:24,830
<font color="signal">I don't have to prepare expensive
caviar or anything, right?</font>

194
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,029
<font color="signal">Then 2.5 million should be
more than enough.</font>

195
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,330
<font color="signal">Okay. Then it'll be 7 p.m. tonight.
I'll leave it to you.</font>

196
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,029
<font color="signal">Oh, yes.</font>

197
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,929
<font color="signal">A lot of my friends are
interested in fortune telling</font>

198
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:35,629
<font color="signal">so they will want their fortunes told.</font>

199
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,029
<font color="signal">That's okay, right?</font>

200
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:39,129
<font color="signal">Of course!</font>

201
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,129
<font color="signal">Welcome!</font>

202
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:07,129
<font color="signal">You're Professor Choi's guests, yes?
Right this way.</font>

203
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,730
<font color="signal">It's important to have an
"I can overcome anything" attitude.</font>

204
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,629
<font color="signal">Have strength.
You'll get through this.</font>

205
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,929
<font color="signal">Thank you.</font>

206
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,029
<font color="signal">Here you go.</font>

207
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,230
<font color="signal">Thank you. I'll use it for a good cause.</font>

208
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,629
<font color="signal">Yes.</font>

209
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,129
<font color="signal">Welcome!</font>

210
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,830
<font color="signal">I have someone
to introduce to all of you.</font>

211
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,629
<font color="signal">Please come here.</font>

212
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,330
<font color="signal">She's this cafe's owner
and a counselor at our center.</font>

213
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,029
<font color="signal">Please give a warm round of applause
for Ms. Go Hye Rim!</font>

214
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:31,029
<font color="signal">Sorry, we need more starters here.</font>

215
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,029
<font color="signal">Okay, wait.</font>

216
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,629
<font color="signal">- Sorry!
- Are you all right?</font>

217
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,330
<font color="signal">Are you okay?
Did you hurt your hand?</font>

218
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:47,129
<font color="signal">I'm fine. Don't act like you're helping
me, and go mingle with your guests.</font>

219
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,330
<font color="signal">No, you go and rest.
I'll clean up here.</font>

220
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,529
<font color="signal">What are you doing?
Why aren't you mingling?</font>

221
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,129
<font color="signal">I greeted everyone.</font>

222
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:10,529
<font color="signal"><i>She's still a bit angry.
Do I have to use this trick up my sleeve?</i></font>

223
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,629
<font color="signal">Thank you.
You've worked hard today.</font>

224
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,330
<font color="signal">Keep up the good work, then.</font>

225
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,429
<font color="signal"><i>At this rate, my tricks will backfire
and I'll end up falling for her.</i></font>

226
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,029
<font color="signal"><i>I can't let myself be shaken up now.</i></font>

227
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:32,730
<font color="signal"><i>I'm not done with my plan yet.</i></font>

228
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:35,429
<font color="signal">Have a good night.</font>

229
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,230
<font color="signal">Oh, hello Professor.</font>

230
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,529
<font color="signal">Did something happen at the cafe?</font>

231
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,629
<font color="signal">I had a get-together, so I
bought out the place tonight.</font>

232
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,429
<font color="signal">And it'd be better for Ms. Hye Rim
to get many customers at once</font>

233
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,730
<font color="signal">as opposed to getting them one at a time.</font>

234
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,929
<font color="signal">Wow, you're being way too considerate,
Professor!</font>

235
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:00,929
<font color="signal">No, that's not true.</font>

236
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:03,129
<font color="signal">Neighbors should help
each other out, after all.</font>

237
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:05,629
<font color="signal">What? Choi Soo Hyun did?</font>

238
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:09,429
<font color="signal">Yeah. I think he bought out the place
tonight for your sake.</font>

239
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,929
<font color="signal">Aren't you grateful?</font>

240
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:17,330
<font color="signal">I don't know if I should be grateful
or be even more suspicious.</font>

241
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,429
<font color="signal">All right... one, two, three!
Two, two, three!</font>

242
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,429
<font color="signal">Put some strength into it!
One, two, three!</font>

243
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:30,029
<font color="signal">Two, two, three!</font>

244
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,129
<font color="signal">All right.
One, two, three!</font>

245
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,429
<font color="signal">- Two, two, three!
- I'm sorry I'm so late!</font>

246
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,730
<font color="signal">There were a lot of materials
for me to organize.</font>

247
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,129
<font color="signal">It's fine. Are you sure
you're not too busy?</font>

248
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:43,529
<font color="signal">No! I made a promise, after all.</font>

249
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,429
<font color="signal">Did you decide on the machine
you want to work out on?</font>

250
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:48,830
<font color="signal">When you do, I'll help you learn the
exercises on it that are right for you.</font>

251
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,730
<font color="signal">That one.</font>

252
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:57,129
<font color="signal">You're doing well!
Just five more minutes, okay?</font>

253
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:01,830
<font color="signal">I can't... I can't do this.</font>

254
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,629
<font color="signal">I want to buy something else!</font>

255
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,830
<font color="signal">A bit faster!</font>

256
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,929
<font color="signal">If you really want a good workout,
you'll have to go faster than that.</font>

257
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:15,129
<font color="signal">Geez... I don't think I can do this.</font>

258
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:18,830
<font color="signal">My legs are shaking...
I think they're going to fall off!</font>

259
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:22,029
<font color="signal">Then do you want to have something
to eat first, Doctor?</font>

260
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,029
<font color="signal">Ta-da!
It's been three minutes!</font>

261
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:30,830
<font color="signal">Put this in too, and try it.</font>

262
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,929
<font color="signal">It tastes a lot better that way.</font>

263
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,730
<font color="signal">Oh my, so you could do that too, huh?</font>

264
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:40,929
<font color="signal">It's my first time
eating at a convenience store.</font>

265
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:45,230
<font color="signal">If you keep following me around, you'll
have a lot of interesting experiences.</font>

266
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:49,029
<font color="signal">Yeah... that'd be nice.
I feel like I'm young again!</font>

267
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,629
<font color="signal">But, Doctor...</font>

268
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:56,429
<font color="signal">You've never worked out before, right?</font>

269
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,830
<font color="signal">All you ever did was study, right?</font>

270
00:15:58,929 --> 00:15:59,929
<font color="signal">Yes.</font>

271
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:04,029
<font color="signal">You can't do that! If you want to live
a long life, you have to work out.</font>

272
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,129
<font color="signal">Ah yes, of course.</font>

273
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,730
<font color="signal">I'm going to live a long life.</font>

274
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,029
<font color="signal">So teach me some easy
workout moves, okay?</font>

275
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,830
<font color="signal">There's no such thing, really...</font>

276
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,330
<font color="signal">Do you want to work out with me
every day, instead?</font>

277
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,830
<font color="signal">Really?</font>

278
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,029
<font color="signal">Starting tomorrow,
we'll go hiking at 7 a.m.</font>

279
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:26,230
<font color="signal">Don't forget, okay?</font>

280
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,730
<font color="signal">Sounds good.</font>

281
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,529
<font color="signal">Um... then... what can I do for you?</font>

282
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,929
<font color="signal">Is there anything that you want,
in particular?</font>

283
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:39,330
<font color="signal">Something I want, huh?
I'm not sure.</font>

284
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,230
<font color="signal">You?</font>

285
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:47,330
<font color="signal">Me... you... want to... have me?</font>

286
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,230
<font color="signal">Yes. Please be my mentor.</font>

287
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,929
<font color="signal">Both of my parents live abroad</font>

288
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:01,330
<font color="signal">and I quit baseball, so I have
nobody to really talk to.</font>

289
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,730
<font color="signal">And you know
how my brother's personality is.</font>

290
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,730
<font color="signal">I didn't know that you were so lonely.</font>

291
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,930
<font color="signal">I'm not lonely...
well, maybe a bit.</font>

292
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,930
<font color="signal">If you have any worries, tell me.</font>

293
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,230
<font color="signal">Is there something you're having
a hard time with?</font>

294
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,329
<font color="signal">What do you think about psychological
experiments, Doctor?</font>

295
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,029
<font color="signal">Well... I do believe they are necessary
if they are for the sake of research.</font>

296
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:31,130
<font color="signal">Why do you ask?</font>

297
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:35,029
<font color="signal">Actually... about Hye Rim...</font>

298
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,730
<font color="signal">she's a part of a psychology
experiment right now.</font>

299
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,829
<font color="signal">Doctor!</font>

300
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,630
<font color="signal">I made some cookies.
Would you like some?</font>

301
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,930
<font color="signal">Um... do you know where
Doctor Choi Soo Hyun is?</font>

302
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,930
<font color="signal">You made Ms. Go Hye Rim
a part of your experiment?</font>

303
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,029
<font color="signal">How dare you!</font>

304
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,230
<font color="signal">It's an experiment that was cleared
by the IRB, Doctor.</font>

305
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,430
<font color="signal">It's not even the real thing;
it's just the preliminary experiment.</font>

306
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,630
<font color="signal">Even so, how could you deceive
someone you work with like that?</font>

307
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,630
<font color="signal">Doctor.</font>

308
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,930
<font color="signal">Do you remember what I asked you
during my time as an undergrad?</font>

309
00:18:52,494 --> 00:18:56,430
<font color="signal">You said that your "heart"
is actually your brain</font>

310
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:01,829
<font color="signal">but love is a wondrous and beautiful
emotion that transcends all science.</font>

311
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:04,829
<font color="signal">And I said that I don't believe love
to be that, but rather</font>

312
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:09,130
<font color="signal">a byproduct of irregular neural activity
within one's brain.</font>

313
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,029
<font color="signal">I do remember.</font>

314
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:15,829
<font color="signal">You kept arguing with me,
even after class was over.</font>

315
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,529
<font color="signal">That's the fundamental basis
of my experiment.</font>

316
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:25,430
<font color="signal">I still believe that love is nothing more
than a type of irregular neural activity.</font>

317
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:28,829
<font color="signal">But...</font>

318
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:33,230
<font color="signal">I keep having the thought that
that isn't all there is to it, somehow.</font>

319
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,829
<font color="signal">And as I worked on other experiments,
I kept becoming curious about this.</font>

320
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:42,829
<font color="signal">Could love be a form of insanity?</font>

321
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:45,230
<font color="signal">Or a divine entity's gift to humanity?</font>

322
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,829
<font color="signal">Love is something that I want
to study forever, as a psychologist.</font>

323
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:54,829
<font color="signal">And this experiment is like
the starting line, in a way.</font>

324
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,630
<font color="signal">Please understand where I'm coming
from as a fellow scientist, Doctor.</font>

325
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,730
<font color="signal">But... was there no other way than this?</font>

326
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,130
<font color="signal">This is an experiment that took me
a very long time to develop.</font>

327
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,029
<font color="signal">And what's your hypothesis?</font>

328
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:14,130
<font color="signal">There is no greater factor influencing
a woman's love than material goods.</font>

329
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,130
<font color="signal">Therefore, women do not truly love.</font>

330
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,130
<font color="signal">That's your hypothesis?</font>

331
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,630
<font color="signal">That's how you see women's love?</font>

332
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,730
<font color="signal">Considering my past experiences
and results, yes.</font>

333
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,130
<font color="signal">Do you want to receive a
consultation from me some time?</font>

334
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,829
<font color="signal">It's something I've always
thought about</font>

335
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:41,230
<font color="signal">but I think that you're
seriously deficient of something.</font>

336
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:47,630
<font color="signal">And women are somehow related to it...
what could it be?</font>

337
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:51,130
<font color="signal">Aren't you curious yourself?</font>

338
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,430
<font color="signal">What? My brother decided to be
Male Subject A again?</font>

339
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,630
<font color="signal">Yes. Maybe it's because of his break,
but he seems to be going all-out.</font>

340
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,329
<font color="signal">What do we do now?</font>

341
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:09,230
<font color="signal">This won't do.
We can't let him have Hye Rim.</font>

342
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,529
<font color="signal">You go and make sure that
he can't contact Go Hye Rim.</font>

343
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:15,130
<font color="signal">In the meantime, I'll be working on her.</font>

344
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,329
<font color="signal">Okay!</font>

345
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,829
<font color="signal">If anything else comes up,
please visit again! Goodbye.</font>

346
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,230
<font color="signal">Yes, goodbye.</font>

347
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,529
<font color="signal">Huh? What is it?
Want coffee?</font>

348
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:29,930
<font color="signal">Ta-da!
You like magic, right?</font>

349
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,230
<font color="signal">Want to go see a show with me tonight?</font>

350
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,029
<font color="signal">Hey, I secretly stole
Doctor Choi's cellphone...</font>

351
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:36,230
<font color="signal">A magic show?</font>

352
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,430
<font color="signal">I really do want to see it, but...</font>

353
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,230
<font color="signal">I'm really busy as of late.</font>

354
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,029
<font color="signal">You can work hard later.
I'll even help you out.</font>

355
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:46,730
<font color="signal">- Excuse me.
- Yes, coming!</font>

356
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,529
<font color="signal">You're coming with me, okay?</font>

357
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,829
<font color="signal">Your cellphone, Doctor.</font>

358
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,630
<font color="signal">Why do you have this?</font>

359
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,329
<font color="signal">Doctor. Seung Chan is going to see
a show with Ms. Hye Rim.</font>

360
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,529
<font color="signal">He's totally going all-out right now.</font>

361
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,630
<font color="signal">Where are they going, exactly?</font>

362
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,130
<font color="signal">A magic show.</font>

363
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,829
<font color="signal">Thank you.</font>

364
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,230
<font color="signal">I really wanted to see this.
Thanks, Seung Chan.</font>

365
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,230
<font color="signal">Oh, it's nothing.</font>

366
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,230
<font color="signal">Even so... you're always looking
out for me and helping me out.</font>

367
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,829
<font color="signal">Do you remember the first time
that you saw me?</font>

368
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:42,029
<font color="signal">Huh?</font>

369
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,630
<font color="signal">- Hey!
- Hello.</font>

370
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,930
<font color="signal">I'm Choi Seung Chan, and I'm
a new employee at the center.</font>

371
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,130
<font color="signal">I wanted to formally introduce myself.</font>

372
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,029
<font color="signal">Yeah. Of course.</font>

373
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:54,730
<font color="signal">You helped me with my laundry
back then, too.</font>

374
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,130
<font color="signal">And you went to the supermarket
with me, and helped me with the cafe.</font>

375
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,230
<font color="signal">And you even helped me out today, too.</font>

376
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,630
<font color="signal">I feel like you're the only one who
looks out for me when I need help.</font>

377
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,730
<font color="signal">I'm really grateful, Seung Chan.</font>

378
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,130
<font color="signal">No need for that.</font>

379
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,930
<font color="signal">I don't think it's a normal
magic show today.</font>

380
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,630
<font color="signal">I heard they're doing something special.</font>

381
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,430
<font color="signal">So there's been rumors that it'll be
even more special because of that.</font>

382
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,430
<font color="signal">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

383
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,930
<font color="signal">It'd be cool if 50,000 won bills
fell from the ceiling or something.</font>

384
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:24,029
<font color="signal">You know when they ask for volunteers?
Let's both volunteer, okay?</font>

385
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,029
<font color="signal">What if they put me in a box
and cut me in half?</font>

386
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,329
<font color="signal">If it's something like that,
I'll go up instead...</font>

387
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,730
<font color="signal">Mr. Soo Hyun?</font>

388
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,930
<font color="signal">Brother...
How did you know...</font>

389
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,430
<font color="signal">I actually quite like magic.</font>

390
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,230
<font color="signal">It's funny to watch people be amused
by such obvious tricks.</font>

391
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,329
<font color="signal">The psychology behind people enjoying
being tricked is quite interesting.</font>

392
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,130
<font color="signal">Hye Rim.
Switch seats with me.</font>

393
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:48,130
<font color="signal">This is my assigned seat.</font>

394
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,130
<font color="signal">If you're a law-abiding citizen,
you should--</font>

395
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,829
<font color="signal">Whatever.</font>

396
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,430
<font color="signal">Hi there.</font>

397
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,630
<font color="signal">Want to link arms?</font>

398
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,630
<font color="signal">Thank you.</font>

399
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,329
<font color="signal">Are you all right?</font>

400
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:13,930
<font color="signal">N... no...</font>

401
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,029
<font color="signal">You look like you're not well.
If so, I could escort you...</font>

402
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,329
<font color="signal">No, that's fine.</font>

403
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:23,730
<font color="signal">Sorry for the trouble.
Don't worry.</font>

404
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,930
<font color="signal">Don't be so amazed.
It's really a simple trick.</font>

405
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,230
<font color="signal">The secret's in that fabric.
Once they lift it, he--</font>

406
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,230
<font color="signal">I never asked you.</font>

407
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,730
<font color="signal">Hello! I'm Magician Lee Sang Gook.</font>

408
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,430
<font color="signal">A lot of people are here today.</font>

409
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,630
<font color="signal">What was the name of my show again?</font>

410
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,430
<font color="signal">- Loveholic!
- Loveholic!</font>

411
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,230
<font color="signal">Yes, it's "Loveholic."</font>

412
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,730
<font color="signal">To tell you the truth,
today is a special day for me.</font>

413
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,230
<font color="signal">I'll be getting married soon.</font>

414
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,430
<font color="signal">Are you all right, ma'am?</font>

415
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,730
<font color="signal">And now, let me introduce
you to her...</font>

416
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,430
<font color="signal">my lovely fiancee.</font>

417
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,529
<font color="signal">First we have to check her breathing.</font>

418
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,230
<font color="signal">Please call an ambulance.</font>

419
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,230
<font color="signal">Hey. What are you doing?</font>

420
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,630
<font color="signal">Damn this girl...
she wore such tacky clothes.</font>

421
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,930
<font color="signal">But... where is this?</font>

422
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,529
<font color="signal">What is this place?</font>

423
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:34,230
<font color="signal">It's a magic show.
Are you feeling all right?</font>

424
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,329
<font color="signal">Geez... magic show.</font>

425
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:40,230
<font color="signal">This girl came all the way here?
So pathetic...</font>

426
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,730
<font color="signal">She drives me crazy!
Damn it...</font>

427
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,230
<font color="signal">What's with her, all of a sudden?
Is she crazy?</font>

428
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,130
<font color="signal">Ms. Yoo Sun. Do you remember me
picking up your phone for you before?</font>

429
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,430
<font color="signal">Yoo Sun, my butt...</font>

430
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,430
<font color="signal">I'm Emma.</font>

431
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,930
<font color="signal">I'm fine, so go about
your own business now.</font>

432
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,529
<font color="signal">Where's the exit?
Over there?</font>

433
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:01,829
<font color="signal">Ms. Yoo Sun, no...
I mean, Ms. Emma.</font>

434
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,730
<font color="signal">Does this happen often?</font>

435
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,829
<font color="signal">If you have some free time,
how about talking with me--</font>

436
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:07,829
<font color="signal">Who the hell are you?</font>

437
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,430
<font color="signal">What are you trying to do?</font>

438
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,930
<font color="signal">- I'm someone who can help people like--
- Don't mess with me!</font>

439
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,230
<font color="signal">You're trying to get rid of me.</font>

440
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,430
<font color="signal">No, I'm not.</font>

441
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,430
<font color="signal">I want you and Yoo Sun to
be able to live together peacefully...</font>

442
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:29,829
<font color="signal">We already are. So back the hell off
while I'm still saying it nicely, okay?</font>

443
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,630
<font color="signal">Are you really feeling all right?</font>

444
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,630
<font color="signal">I told you I'm fine!
What the hell is with you?</font>

445
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,230
<font color="signal">What was that?
Is she really crazy?</font>

446
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,829
<font color="signal">We'll have to do a detailed test
to be sure</font>

447
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,730
<font color="signal">but I think it's DID
(dissociative identity disorder).</font>

448
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,029
<font color="signal">What? DID?
That really exists?</font>

449
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:52,329
<font color="signal">Isn't that really serious?
Is it okay to send her off like that?</font>

450
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:54,329
<font color="signal">There's nothing we can do right now.</font>

451
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:56,230
<font color="signal">Her other personality
is dominating right now</font>

452
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,930
<font color="signal">so she'll think we're trying to
get rid of her no matter what we say.</font>

453
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,029
<font color="signal">Then, what do we do?
Just let her leave, like that?</font>

454
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:04,430
<font color="signal">We'll have to wait.</font>

455
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,730
<font color="signal">If we're lucky, Ms. Yoo Sun will wake up,
see my business card, and come see me.</font>

456
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,329
<font color="signal">And if not...</font>

457
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,829
<font color="signal">How was that?
Is this good enough?</font>

458
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:36,029
<font color="signal">It's perfect.
You're doing really well.</font>

459
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,230
<font color="signal">That's good.
Then Ms. Hye Rim will like it too, right?</font>

460
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,630
<font color="signal">You... still like my older sister?</font>

461
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,630
<font color="signal">Of course.</font>

462
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,930
<font color="signal">Then what am I to you?</font>

463
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,029
<font color="signal">You even kissed me instead of her!</font>

464
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,130
<font color="signal">Yes... isn't that what we agreed on?</font>

465
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,130
<font color="signal">Just plain smooches
and kisses are different, you know!</font>

466
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,029
<font color="signal">A kiss is the same as saying,
"I like you. Let's go out!"</font>

467
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,630
<font color="signal">You mean that this physical action
is the same as words?</font>

468
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,730
<font color="signal">You're studying psychology, and yet
you know nothing about people's hearts...</font>

469
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,029
<font color="signal">This is the first time that you've
visited the center in person.</font>

470
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:40,029
<font color="signal">I figured I should confirm that
everything is going smoothly here.</font>

471
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,130
<font color="signal">You left it in the hands of a pro,
so you should have more faith in me.</font>

472
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:47,029
<font color="signal">I know, but I've been backstabbed
many times before.</font>

473
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,930
<font color="signal">Oh, yes.</font>

474
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:53,630
<font color="signal">That woman who won't listen to you...
what does she do when you have clients?</font>

475
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,230
<font color="signal">Do you lock her up or something?</font>

476
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,930
<font color="signal">There's a dark cave
in the basement of this building.</font>

477
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,230
<font color="signal">I chain her up there
and only give her water.</font>

478
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,730
<font color="signal">And sometimes I beat her
with a whip.</font>

479
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,329
<font color="signal">Someone else might think
you were being serious!</font>

480
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,130
<font color="signal">How many people have you fixed
with consultations?</font>

481
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,630
<font color="signal">People aren't machines.
You don't "fix" them.</font>

482
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,329
<font color="signal">All I do is help people living irregular
lives live more regularly.</font>

483
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:21,230
<font color="signal">You sure are giving a complicated answer
to a simple question.</font>

484
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,230
<font color="signal">But even so, you've "fixed"
at least...</font>

485
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,829
<font color="signal">I mean, you've "helped people
live more regular lives," right?</font>

486
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:28,630
<font color="signal">Due to my values,
I can't answer that question.</font>

487
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,430
<font color="signal">There is no such person as a perfectly
normal person in this world--</font>

488
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,829
<font color="signal">But there should be some
symptoms they've had.</font>

489
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:36,430
<font color="signal">I'm asking you how many people's symptoms
were better when they left this place.</font>

490
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,230
<font color="signal">Is that so difficult to understand?</font>

491
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,930
<font color="signal">I don't know.</font>

492
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,829
<font color="signal">But I'm quite quick when it comes
to my diagnoses.</font>

493
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:46,130
<font color="signal">I see a couple of symptoms
in you right now.</font>

494
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,829
<font color="signal">You're displaying free-flowing anxiety,
agitation, and hints of anxiety disorder.</font>

495
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:53,430
<font color="signal">And it seems that you have a bit
of hypochondriasis, as well.</font>

496
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,730
<font color="signal">And of course, you definitely seem
to have narcissistic personality traits.</font>

497
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,930
<font color="signal">I also see some mood lability as well.</font>

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
<font color="signal">With all this difficult terminology
you're throwing at me</font>

499
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,900
<font color="signal">you really do seem like
a legitimate professor.</font>

500
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:10,509
<font color="signal">People's hearts are so cunning, right?</font>

501
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:15,708
<font color="signal">If you're so curious about the work I do,
why not get a consultation?</font>

502
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:20,608
<font color="signal">No, it's not for me...
Hey, let me ask you something.</font>

503
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:23,423
<font color="signal">What kind of disease
is dissociative disorder?</font>

504
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,923
<font color="signal">Is it that hard for them to act normal?</font>

505
00:31:27,423 --> 00:31:29,521
<font color="signal">Why are you curious about that,
all of a sudden?</font>

506
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:34,423
<font color="signal">My friend's in-laws are concerned
with it, so I was curious.</font>

507
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:36,810
<font color="signal">There are many different kinds
of dissociative disorder.</font>

508
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:40,111
<font color="signal">Loss of memory type, fleeing type,
mood-changing type...</font>

509
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:42,510
<font color="signal">Anyway... is it something
that's really serious?</font>

510
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,410
<font color="signal">It depends on the situation,
but it is a serious condition.</font>

511
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,910
<font color="signal">It's something that develops
as a form of escaping severe pain</font>

512
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,111
<font color="signal">when reality becomes
too much to bear, after all.</font>

513
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,210
<font color="signal">Severe pain?</font>

514
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,710
<font color="signal">Yes, welcome!</font>

515
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:13,210
<font color="signal">Hello. This is the psychological
counseling center Madame Antoine, right?</font>

516
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,910
<font color="signal">Yes, it is.</font>

517
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,010
<font color="signal">This was in my bag, so...</font>

518
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,611
<font color="signal"><i>[Choi Soo Hyun, Ph.D]</i></font>

519
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,810
<font color="signal">I passed out?</font>

520
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,210
<font color="signal">Yes. You don't remember any of it?</font>

521
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,410
<font color="signal">Oh... I wasn't really
in the right state of mind back then...</font>

522
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,410
<font color="signal">But... what happened at the magic show?</font>

523
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,611
<font color="signal">Did Sang Wook... I mean....</font>

524
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:46,111
<font color="signal">didn't the magician
announce something?</font>

525
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:49,310
<font color="signal">Yes, he did. He announced
that he'd be getting married.</font>

526
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:59,810
<font color="signal">Did you know him?</font>

527
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,910
<font color="signal">We were engaged once.</font>

528
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,010
<font color="signal">But one day, I suddenly
couldn't get in touch with him.</font>

529
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,410
<font color="signal">So I looked into it, and he
apparently left for England...</font>

530
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:25,410
<font color="signal">and then I suddenly heard
that he was getting married.</font>

531
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:32,310
<font color="signal">I couldn't believe it, so I felt like
I had to confirm it with my own eyes...</font>

532
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:38,210
<font color="signal">but I was too scared to go confront him.</font>

533
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:43,310
<font color="signal">So I went to his magic show...</font>

534
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:54,310
<font color="signal">I'm sorry.</font>

535
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:02,611
<font color="signal">Does Emma know about this?</font>

536
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,510
<font color="signal">You... met her?</font>

537
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,210
<font color="signal">Yes. But she seemed to really hate me.</font>

538
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,309
<font color="signal">Then I'm sure you're aware
of my condition, too.</font>

539
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:20,610
<font color="signal">Just the gist of it.</font>

540
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,309
<font color="signal">You've gotten treatment
for DID before, right?</font>

541
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:26,010
<font color="signal">Yes, in junior high school.</font>

542
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,809
<font color="signal">But I don't want to receive
treatment again.</font>

543
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:33,309
<font color="signal">I only came here to find out
what happened at the magic show.</font>

544
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:35,610
<font color="signal">Why don't you want
to receive treatment?</font>

545
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,911
<font color="signal">I'm sorry, Doctor.
I'll go pay the consultation fee.</font>

546
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,911
<font color="signal">No need for that,
but please tell me...</font>

547
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:57,510
<font color="signal">Geez! Ugh, I'm so tired,
I could die...</font>

548
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,210
<font color="signal"><i>Can you meet me
where we kissed last time?</i></font>

549
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,411
<font color="signal"><i>I have something to ask you about the
correlation between actions and words.</i></font>

550
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:12,728
<font color="signal">I'd have to be crazy to go!</font>

551
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,010
<font color="signal">Hey. This is our spot!</font>

552
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,110
<font color="signal">Piss off while I'm still
saying it nicely.</font>

553
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,110
<font color="signal">High schoolers shouldn't be smoking.</font>

554
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,610
<font color="signal">Who the hell is this jackass?</font>

555
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,309
<font color="signal">Do you need a beating to send you away,
or are you going to leave?</font>

556
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:41,010
<font color="signal">No. I have to meet someone here, so...</font>

557
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:45,010
<font color="signal">The hell are you looking at,
you bastard?</font>

558
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,010
<font color="signal">Hey, take his money since
you're beating him up anyway.</font>

559
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,010
<font color="signal">Sure.</font>

560
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,610
<font color="signal">Can you move?
I have business here.</font>

561
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,809
<font color="signal">So do we, all right?
Just go back.</font>

562
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,309
<font color="signal">Ji Ho!</font>

563
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:12,110
<font color="signal">You're not going to move?</font>

564
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,411
<font color="signal">Are you talking down to me?
Just piss off!</font>

565
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:18,210
<font color="signal">Hey.
Hey!</font>

566
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,210
<font color="signal">Ji Ho, are you okay?</font>

567
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,610
<font color="signal">I have a third-degree black belt
in Hapkido and Tae Kwon Do!</font>

568
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,010
<font color="signal">Excuse me! These high schoolers
are beating people up! Run!</font>

569
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,110
<font color="signal">Hey, you punks.
What are you doing?</font>

570
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,010
<font color="signal">Ji Ho! Are you okay?
Get up.</font>

571
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,710
<font color="signal">Are you okay?</font>

572
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,110
<font color="signal">Goodbye.</font>

573
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,610
<font color="signal">Can we have some band-aids
and ointment?</font>

574
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,110
<font color="signal">Do you want something
to calm your nerves, too?</font>

575
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,181
<font color="signal">You don't need to buy things like that.
I'm fine.</font>

576
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:04,610
<font color="signal">Please give us
a nerve-calmer, too.</font>

577
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,911
<font color="signal">How much is everything?</font>

578
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,309
<font color="signal">Ointment, 3,500 won. Band-aids,
2,500 won. Nerve-calmer, 5,000 won.</font>

579
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:13,110
<font color="signal">All together, that's 11,000.</font>

580
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:16,210
<font color="signal">You can't even do such easy math?</font>

581
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,510
<font color="signal">Why are you getting so mad?</font>

582
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,610
<font color="signal">I'm embarrassed.</font>

583
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:29,010
<font color="signal">I couldn't even protect a woman,
much less avoid getting myself beat up.</font>

584
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,610
<font color="signal">Woman? Am I a woman to you?</font>

585
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,610
<font color="signal">Are you a man, then?</font>

586
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,911
<font color="signal">Since when did you think of me
as a woman?</font>

587
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,911
<font color="signal">Yoo Rim. Are you really a third-degree
black belt in Hapkido and Tae Kwon Do?</font>

588
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:43,411
<font color="signal">No. Just in Hapkido.</font>

589
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,911
<font color="signal">Where are you going?</font>

590
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:47,210
<font color="signal">To learn Hapkido!</font>

591
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:59,110
<font color="signal"><i>[Name: Lee Yoo Sun]</i></font>

592
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,210
<font color="signal"><i>Hello?</i></font>

593
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,411
<font color="signal">- Is Ms. Yoo Sun...
<i>- There's nobody like that here.</i></font>

594
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,809
<font color="signal"><i>Hello?</i></font>

595
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:29,309
<font color="signal"><i>Emma... I need someone
who can get along with Emma.</i></font>

596
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,110
<font color="signal"><i>Someone who is sharp-witted
but can be sensitive.</i></font>

597
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,911
<font color="signal">Hello.
My name is Go Hye Rim.</font>

598
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:42,210
<font color="signal"><i>If I just ask her to come with me,
she'll refuse.</i></font>

599
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,809
<font color="signal">Doctor. My phone died...
could I borrow yours?</font>

600
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,010
<font color="signal">Sure. But what is it?</font>

601
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,411
<font color="signal">Please enjoy!</font>

602
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,610
<font color="signal"><i>I have to meet a client outside
of the office, but I need your help.</i></font>

603
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,911
<font color="signal"><i>Could you come with me?</i></font>

604
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:34,710
<font color="signal">We're going to meet Dr. Bae
on the way. Get in.</font>

605
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,210
<font color="signal">You're going, too?</font>

606
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,210
<font color="signal">She's my client.
Of course. Let's go.</font>

607
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:48,110
<font color="signal">Yes, Doctor?</font>

608
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,010
<font color="signal">What? You can't make it?</font>

609
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,010
<font color="signal">I guess it can't be helped.
The two of us will go.</font>

610
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,210
<font color="signal">She said that something came up
and she can't come.</font>

611
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,809
<font color="signal">Liar.</font>

612
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,710
<font color="signal">You were lying
from the start, weren't you?</font>

613
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,309
<font color="signal">She wasn't coming from the start, right?</font>

614
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:08,210
<font color="signal">I guess you've caught me.</font>

615
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,710
<font color="signal">Well, you're free to think
as you please about it.</font>

616
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,911
<font color="signal">Let me off right now.</font>

617
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,411
<font color="signal">Is your project going well?</font>

618
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,510
<font color="signal">I'd like to contribute to the cause
for world peace, too.</font>

619
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,309
<font color="signal">You already know, though.</font>

620
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:23,110
<font color="signal">What do you mean?
Is there something you're hiding from me?</font>

621
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:29,632
<font color="signal">Since you're helping me with my work,
I want to help you.</font>

622
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:32,532
<font color="signal">How much would be enough?
Your stores earnings for one day?</font>

623
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,233
<font color="signal">No, give me double that.</font>

624
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,333
<font color="signal">But, who's this person we're meeting?</font>

625
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,233
<font color="signal">The person who passed out
at the magic show before.</font>

626
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:44,931
<font color="signal">The person with DID?
She came to the center?</font>

627
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:48,333
<font color="signal">Yes. Ms. Yoo Sun came to see me.</font>

628
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,132
<font color="signal">But Ms. Yoo Sun is skeptical
regarding the treatment.</font>

629
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,632
<font color="signal">I guess she doesn't really want
to get rid of Emma.</font>

630
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:56,431
<font color="signal">Then... how would it help
if she meets me?</font>

631
00:40:56,431 --> 00:40:59,132
<font color="signal">You were hiding behind Seung Chan
at the magic show.</font>

632
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:00,532
<font color="signal">I'm sure she didn't get
a good look at your face.</font>

633
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,532
<font color="signal">Then give me three times
my daily earnings.</font>

634
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:09,132
<font color="signal">If I have to convince someone when I'm
not sure it'll be Yoo Sun or Emma...</font>

635
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:11,132
<font color="signal">- I think it's only fair--
- Just a second. I need gas.</font>

636
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:15,333
<font color="signal">Yes, here you are.
Goodbye.</font>

637
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:20,233
<font color="signal">Wait.</font>

638
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:24,833
<font color="signal">6,000 won is enough for a car wash!
Let's get your car washed!</font>

639
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,431
<font color="signal">I... don't do that myself.</font>

640
00:41:28,431 --> 00:41:29,431
<font color="signal">I can tell Ji Ho to do that
for me later--</font>

641
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:33,333
<font color="signal">Is he your slave or something?
Also, these will expire tomorrow!</font>

642
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:36,532
<font color="signal">Come on, let's do it.
It'd be a shame to waste them.</font>

643
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,333
<font color="signal">The car isn't really that dirty...</font>

644
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,733
<font color="signal">Don't you see the rain stains
on your window?</font>

645
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:42,632
<font color="signal">Also, if you have 6,000 won
worth of tickets</font>

646
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:45,333
<font color="signal">You can get a car wash for 4,000 won
and spring for water and tissues, too!</font>

647
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,632
<font color="signal">Get your car washed
and get the free stuff too!</font>

648
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:49,333
<font color="signal">A thrifty life is a happy life!</font>

649
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,032
<font color="signal">What's the matter?</font>

650
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:31,632
<font color="signal">Do you have a water drop allergy,
or something like that?</font>

651
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,333
<font color="signal">It's not an allergy, but...</font>

652
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:38,132
<font color="signal">when I get hit by drops of liquid,
it's extremely painful.</font>

653
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:41,431
<font color="signal">But they're not really falling right now.</font>

654
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:42,931
<font color="signal">They're just falling outside.</font>

655
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:44,532
<font color="signal">Does that affect you too?</font>

656
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:46,733
<font color="signal">That's just how it feels.</font>

657
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,233
<font color="signal">That's why you made Ji Ho
get your car washed...</font>

658
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:55,333
<font color="signal">I'm sorry. I was being stubborn about
it, and now you're so uncomfortable.</font>

659
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,132
<font color="signal">No, I'm the one who's sorry.</font>

660
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:06,893
<font color="signal">I'm sorry I told you to quit your job
as a counselor before.</font>

661
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,791
<font color="signal">Why... do you think I did that?</font>

662
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:15,893
<font color="signal">Because you grew to like me
way too much?</font>

663
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,492
<font color="signal">So you wanted to cut me out?</font>

664
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:18,992
<font color="signal">Yes.</font>

665
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:25,592
<font color="signal">I'm being honest with you.</font>

666
00:43:26,092 --> 00:43:28,291
<font color="signal">People tend to become more honest</font>

667
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:31,492
<font color="signal">when they feel that their
lives are being threatened.</font>

668
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:37,893
<font color="signal">Do you think I'll forgive you
because of that?</font>

669
00:43:37,893 --> 00:43:39,791
<font color="signal">It doesn't matter if you do or not.</font>

670
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:42,992
<font color="signal">I just wanted to tell you how I felt.</font>

671
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:02,092
<font color="signal">All right... we're done
getting a car wash</font>

672
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:03,992
<font color="signal">and I'm done making my difficult apology.</font>

673
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:05,192
<font color="signal">Let's go.</font>

674
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,930
<font color="signal">Who do you think will be there?
Yoo Sun? Emma?</font>

675
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,630
<font color="signal">There might be another
personality that comes out instead.</font>

676
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,330
<font color="signal">Really? Oh my goodness...</font>

677
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,630
<font color="signal">Be strong.
I'll give you more money.</font>

678
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,130
<font color="signal">I'll give you three times more than
your daily earnings.</font>

679
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,930
<font color="signal">Who is it?</font>

680
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,730
<font color="signal">Hello!</font>

681
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,930
<font color="signal">You're here again, you bastard?</font>

682
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,730
<font color="signal">How did you know my address?
Did Yoo Sun tell you?</font>

683
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,030
<font color="signal">First, please calm down...</font>

684
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:45,930
<font color="signal">Hello! I'm a representative
from a cosmetics company.</font>

685
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,430
<font color="signal">Oh my... you have such great skin!</font>

686
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,830
<font color="signal">But I see a few freckles.</font>

687
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,630
<font color="signal">If you cover it up with this,
they'll be gone in a flash!</font>

688
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,130
<font color="signal">You're not with him?</font>

689
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,730
<font color="signal">No. I don't know who he is.</font>

690
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:07,830
<font color="signal">If he's a problematic person,
want me to call the cops for you?</font>

691
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:11,630
<font color="signal">You can't just open your door
for people like him!</font>

692
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,130
<font color="signal">Something terrible could happen!</font>

693
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,030
<font color="signal">But first, take a look at these products!</font>

694
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:20,830
<font color="signal">You don't need to buy anything.
I'll just do your makeup and go.</font>

695
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,930
<font color="signal">Piss off while I'm being nice about it!</font>

696
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,230
<font color="signal">What are you doing?</font>

697
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,130
<font color="signal">Nothing, really.</font>

698
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,230
<font color="signal">I sold a lot already,
so this is all I have left, but...</font>

699
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,930
<font color="signal">I'll give you a special
70 percent discount.</font>

700
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,930
<font color="signal">Look. It's pretty, right?</font>

701
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,730
<font color="signal">But... you have such a cool
sense of style.</font>

702
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,730
<font color="signal">But... isn't this one used?</font>

703
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,430
<font color="signal">It's one that I carry around as a sample.</font>

704
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,030
<font color="signal">Come over here. I'll transform you
to suit your style.</font>

705
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,430
<font color="signal">How is it?
You like it a lot better, right?</font>

706
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,430
<font color="signal">You look a rock singer, right?</font>

707
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,830
<font color="signal">It's all right.</font>

708
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,730
<font color="signal">Want me to make you up, too?</font>

709
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,330
<font color="signal">How is it?
It's cool, right?</font>

710
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,430
<font color="signal">Wow, it's so cool!</font>

711
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:24,930
<font color="signal">Just use informal speech!
We're both getting old together anyway.</font>

712
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:27,030
<font color="signal">I feel like I'm getting
good vibes from you.</font>

713
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,830
<font color="signal">Want to go shopping with me?</font>

714
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,030
<font color="signal">I'll buy you makeup, too.</font>

715
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,030
<font color="signal">Okay!
Should we?</font>

716
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,030
<font color="signal">I'm clothes shopping with Emma.
What should I do now?</font>

717
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,930
<font color="signal">Was there anything unique at her place?</font>

718
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,930
<font color="signal">There were a lot of paintings.</font>

719
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,430
<font color="signal">I took a couple of photos.</font>

720
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,830
<font color="signal">Send those to me, and just become
closer to Emma for now.</font>

721
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:53,330
<font color="signal">And ask her about her relationship with
Yoo Sun when you get the chance.</font>

722
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,930
<font color="signal">All right, that's it!</font>

723
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:02,730
<font color="signal">How is it that your sense of style
is the same as mine?</font>

724
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,230
<font color="signal">I'll buy you this entire outfit.</font>

725
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,530
<font color="signal">Excuse me.
This, please.</font>

726
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,630
<font color="signal">Is it okay if you use all this money?</font>

727
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,130
<font color="signal">It's fine. It's actually my friend's card</font>

728
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:19,130
<font color="signal">but my money is hers,
and her money is mine.</font>

729
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:23,230
<font color="signal">Oh... do you live with her?</font>

730
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,730
<font color="signal">Yeah... a really quiet chick
named Yoo Sun.</font>

731
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:28,630
<font color="signal">Actually, she's kind of an outcast
and I'm the only friend she has</font>

732
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,630
<font color="signal">so she can't live without me.</font>

733
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,030
<font color="signal">But Ms. Yoo Sun is quite
skeptical about the treatment.</font>

734
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,030
<font color="signal">I guess she doesn't really
want to get rid of Emma.</font>

735
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:42,330
<font color="signal">Then... did your friend
paint the paintings in that room before?</font>

736
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,730
<font color="signal">Yeah, probably.</font>

737
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:48,230
<font color="signal">Hey, let's stop talking about
boring stuff and go shopping, already.</font>

738
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:54,630
<font color="signal">I met Ms. Yoo Sun while I was
publishing a book three years ago.</font>

739
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:58,130
<font color="signal">She was the illustrator, but her
drawings were so good</font>

740
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,330
<font color="signal">so I started seeing her more often.
Eventually, we started dating.</font>

741
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,830
<font color="signal">I heard that you two
really loved each other.</font>

742
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,030
<font color="signal">So what broke you two up?</font>

743
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,930
<font color="signal">She came to see me
and broke up with me out of nowhere.</font>

744
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,630
<font color="signal">What reason do you need?
I've just grown to dislike you!</font>

745
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:15,830
<font color="signal">Ms. Yoo Sun! Even up until the
day before yesterday, we were fine...</font>

746
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,630
<font color="signal">so why are you acting this way now?</font>

747
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:21,130
<font color="signal">I didn't really like you,
I just tolerated it up until now.</font>

748
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,430
<font color="signal">So get what I'm saying through
your thick skull, and piss off.</font>

749
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,130
<font color="signal">If you don't, I'll report you
to the police as a stalker!</font>

750
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,330
<font color="signal">It was way too strange.</font>

751
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,030
<font color="signal">It was as if she had suddenly changed.</font>

752
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,430
<font color="signal">I kept on going to her place,
but she wouldn't see me.</font>

753
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:42,030
<font color="signal"><i>It was Emma. It wasn't Yoo Sun
who asked to break up, but Emma.</i></font>

754
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,930
<font color="signal">So I decided to go study abroad.</font>

755
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:49,830
<font color="signal">I'd originally planned to go
with Ms. Yoo Sun, but...</font>

756
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:58,730
<font color="signal">So that's how it was. She talked as if
she was really close to Yoo Sun.</font>

757
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,130
<font color="signal">So did Emma dump the magician
out of jealousy</font>

758
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,130
<font color="signal">because she didn't want to lose Yoo Sun?</font>

759
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,230
<font color="signal">Yes. It seems that way.</font>

760
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,330
<font color="signal">But... did you get a bit more
friendly with Emma?</font>

761
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,030
<font color="signal">Yes. A lot.
She's quite liberal when it comes to...</font>

762
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,430
<font color="signal"><i>[Incoming call: Choi Seung Chan]</i></font>

763
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,130
<font color="signal">Oh my. Seung Chan is calling.
I'll talk to you later.</font>

764
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,230
<font color="signal">Yeah, Seung Chan?
What's up?</font>

765
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,330
<font color="signal"><i>Go Hye Rim!
Are you good at drawing?</i></font>

766
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,830
<font color="signal">What are you doing?</font>

767
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,430
<font color="signal">You're here?</font>

768
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,930
<font color="signal">First, put this on.</font>

769
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:48,330
<font color="signal">This spot is where my kids rest
while playing baseball</font>

770
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,230
<font color="signal">but the wall is too blank, so I wanted
to draw something pretty here.</font>

771
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,430
<font color="signal">I even got permission from the principal.</font>

772
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,930
<font color="signal">Want to draw with me?</font>

773
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,130
<font color="signal">Really?</font>

774
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,030
<font color="signal">I can draw whatever I want?</font>

775
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,430
<font color="signal">Hey!
What the hell!</font>

776
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,630
<font color="signal">- Get over here!
- Oh no!</font>

777
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,530
<font color="signal">Hey, stop it!</font>

778
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,430
<font color="signal">It's pretty.</font>

779
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,930
<font color="signal">I'm sure it'll look even cooler
during the daytime.</font>

780
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,930
<font color="signal">Huh?
What's that?</font>

781
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,630
<font color="signal">I don't know.
What could it be?</font>

782
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:57,530
<font color="signal"><i>[I like you]</i></font>

783
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,730
<font color="signal">That's some great lettering, isn't it?</font>

784
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,430
<font color="signal">I was going to draw your face too</font>

785
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,730
<font color="signal">but I was afraid my kids would see
and be like, "it's a witch!" so I didn't.</font>

786
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,810
<font color="signal">Seung Chan.</font>

787
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,430
<font color="signal">You don't need to give me
a reply right now.</font>

788
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:15,430
<font color="signal">I just... felt like I couldn't
keep it inside anymore.</font>

789
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,430
<font color="signal">So I let it out, is all.</font>

790
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,030
<font color="signal">All right. Shall we go, then?</font>

791
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,830
<font color="signal">Hey, you're not going
to erase that?</font>

792
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,530
<font color="signal">It's not like I specified who it is,
so why does it matter?</font>

793
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:31,530
<font color="signal">You're going to get in trouble for
writing nonsense on the wall!</font>

794
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,630
<font color="signal">That's my problem, not yours.</font>

795
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,430
<font color="signal">Hey, what if you get fired?</font>

796
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:41,230
<font color="signal">Who'd fire the Rookie of the Year?</font>

797
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,730
<font color="signal">- Wow.
- It's so pretty!</font>

798
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,430
<font color="signal">I wonder who drew this?</font>

799
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,930
<font color="signal">- Wow, so pretty!
- Wow! I wonder who drew this?</font>

800
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,930
<font color="signal">- It's pretty, right?
- Yeah.</font>

801
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:58,030
<font color="signal">You're positive?</font>

802
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,830
<font color="signal">Seung Chan really wrote this
and showed Ms. Hye Rim?</font>

803
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,230
<font color="signal">I'm telling you, yes!</font>

804
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,030
<font color="signal">I even saw him bring
the spray paint in yesterday.</font>

805
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,930
<font color="signal">He's such a terrible guy.</font>

806
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:12,730
<font color="signal">He always uses me and then does
this kind of stuff in the meantime...</font>

807
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,130
<font color="signal">His tactics are way too immature.
Is he a kid? Vandalizing walls...</font>

808
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,230
<font color="signal">Right?
Should we erase it with this?</font>

809
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,330
<font color="signal">Where is he right now?</font>

810
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,930
<font color="signal">What, I'm not allowed
to write on things?</font>

811
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,030
<font color="signal">I even got permission from the principal.</font>

812
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,730
<font color="signal">So what?</font>

813
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,530
<font color="signal">What did Ms. Go Hye Rim say?</font>

814
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,330
<font color="signal">Why do I have to answer that?</font>

815
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:32,330
<font color="signal">You're my competitor!</font>

816
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,130
<font color="signal">I'm asking right now as the
supervisor of this experiment.</font>

817
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,230
<font color="signal">What did she say?
Was it a yes, or no?</font>

818
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,330
<font color="signal">Hmm... a tentative yes?</font>

819
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:44,030
<font color="signal">When she saw the writing,
she laughed like this.</font>

820
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,430
<font color="signal">Isn't it over at this point?</font>

821
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,730
<font color="signal">Game, set.</font>

822
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,330
<font color="signal">Where is Ms. Go Hye Rim?</font>

823
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,330
<font color="signal">She went out to meet someone.</font>

824
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,030
<font color="signal">And she told me to give this
to you if you came by.</font>

825
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,130
<font color="signal"><i>I got a call from Emma,
so I'm going to meet her.</i></font>

826
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:11,330
<font color="signal"><i>It's my second time seeing her so you'll
give me double my daily earnings, right?</i></font>

827
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,130
<font color="signal">Ta-da!</font>

828
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,430
<font color="signal">Awesome!
You look so cool!</font>

829
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,730
<font color="signal">If we both got these,
I bet people would think we were twins.</font>

830
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,030
<font color="signal">Should we start a band together?</font>

831
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,430
<font color="signal">It's so fun to have met a friend like you</font>

832
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,730
<font color="signal">after hanging out with
Yoo Sun all the time.</font>

833
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,430
<font color="signal">Me too.</font>

834
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,030
<font color="signal">But, about your friend, Yoo Sun...</font>

835
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:38,030
<font color="signal">it seems like she's
really good at drawing.</font>

836
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:39,430
<font color="signal">Yeah, she's an illustrator.</font>

837
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:42,830
<font color="signal">She's so quiet that she never goes out
and just draws all day.</font>

838
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:48,630
<font color="signal">Yoo Sun was a very quiet child.</font>

839
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,730
<font color="signal">She didn't talk much and was really shy.</font>

840
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,230
<font color="signal">It might be because she was in an
accident when she was young.</font>

841
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:55,230
<font color="signal">An accident?</font>

842
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,430
<font color="signal">When she was in first grade,
her family went to a river</font>

843
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,230
<font color="signal">but there was an accident there.</font>

844
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,730
<font color="signal">Yoo Sun fell into the water,
and her father died trying to save her.</font>

845
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:11,430
<font color="signal">Oh... so that's why she painted
a picture of a river.</font>

846
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:18,530
<font color="signal"><i>When Yoo Sun was young, water-related
accident occurred; father passed away.</i></font>

847
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,530
<font color="signal">So the people who passed
away back then...</font>

848
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,430
<font color="signal">Were her mother and father.</font>

849
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,630
<font color="signal">Her mother, too?</font>

850
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:28,430
<font color="signal">Yes. Her father was swept away
by the waves</font>

851
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:33,430
<font color="signal">and her mother managed to save Yoo Sun
but didn't have any more strength</font>

852
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,330
<font color="signal">so she drowned.</font>

853
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,630
<font color="signal">Have you been well, my daughter?</font>

854
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:47,030
<font color="signal">Yes, Mom.</font>

855
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:55,130
<font color="signal">So Ms. Yoo Sun's only friend is Emma.</font>

856
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:59,630
<font color="signal">It's different from other cases since
the personalities are coexisting well.</font>

857
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,330
<font color="signal">It won't be easy.</font>

858
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,830
<font color="signal">Wasn't Emma the one who made
Yoo Sun break up with the magician?</font>

859
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,430
<font color="signal">If Yoo Sun knew that,
wouldn't that make things different?</font>

860
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,330
<font color="signal">You'll have to tread with caution
with that, though.</font>

861
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:14,330
<font color="signal">Right now, Ms. Yoo Sun considers Emma
her closest friend.</font>

862
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,730
<font color="signal">At any rate, good work.</font>

863
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,430
<font color="signal">No, not really.</font>

864
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:23,230
<font color="signal">I got to have a great time with Emma
thanks to all this.</font>

865
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,430
<font color="signal">Things are busy at the cafe,
so I have to go.</font>

866
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:29,230
<font color="signal">Can you tell Mr. Soo Hyun
about the situation?</font>

867
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,430
<font color="signal">Of course.</font>

868
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,230
<font color="signal">Oh, yes... Ms. Hye Rim.</font>

869
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:39,730
<font color="signal">Actually, Hye Rim is a part of a
psychological experiment right now.</font>

870
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,130
<font color="signal">Did Professor Choi, by any chance...</font>

871
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:47,230
<font color="signal">ask you to be a part of an experiment?</font>

872
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:48,930
<font color="signal">Yes. Something about ideal types.</font>

873
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,130
<font color="signal">Why?</font>

874
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,530
<font color="signal">Did you agree to do it?</font>

875
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,230
<font color="signal">I'm already a part of it.</font>

876
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:59,330
<font color="signal">Why, Doctor?
Do you know something about it?</font>

877
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:01,930
<font color="signal">Actually, that is...</font>

878
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,830
<font color="signal">I'm sorry I'm late.</font>

879
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,030
<font color="signal">Ms. Hye Rim, you said
that you had to go, right?</font>

880
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,030
<font color="signal">Go ahead.</font>

881
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,430
<font color="signal">I'll tell Professor Choi
about Ms. Yoo Sun.</font>

882
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,430
<font color="signal">Okay...</font>

883
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:31,830
<font color="signal">Ji Ho. I'm going clothes shopping.
Want to come with me?</font>

884
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,830
<font color="signal">Yes.</font>

885
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,930
<font color="signal">How is it?
Which one suits me more?</font>

886
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,730
<font color="signal">Both of them. You look good
no matter what you wear.</font>

887
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,130
<font color="signal">Then I'll try on both.</font>

888
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,830
<font color="signal">Say "ah!"</font>

889
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:19,330
<font color="signal">But, Ms. Hye Rim... why are you
being so nice to me today?</font>

890
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,930
<font color="signal">Don't think about it too hard.</font>

891
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,130
<font color="signal">Does there need to be a
reason to eat and hang out?</font>

892
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:24,730
<font color="signal">Just enjoy it.</font>

893
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:26,830
<font color="signal">Say "ah!"</font>

894
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,530
<font color="signal">Wow! Our Ji Ho is so good
at drinking, too!</font>

895
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,430
<font color="signal">Yes. I'm good at everything that doesn't
require physical exertion.</font>

896
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:47,830
<font color="signal">Since we're drinking,
want to play the Truth Game?</font>

897
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,730
<font color="signal">Okay. Ask me anything.</font>

898
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,630
<font color="signal">Don't think too hard
and answer right away.</font>

899
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,230
<font color="signal">- What's your height?
- 185 centimeters.</font>

900
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,230
<font color="signal">- Weight?
- 65 kilograms.</font>

901
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,630
<font color="signal">- Favorite color?

902
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,030
<font color="signal">- Jjajjangmyun or jjamppong?
- Jjamppong!</font>

903
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,830
<font color="signal">- Favorite season?
- Autumn!</font>

904
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,130
<font color="signal">The title of the experiment
being done on me?</font>

905
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,230
<font color="signal">Madame Antoine.</font>

906
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,930
<font color="signal">I thought it was one
based on ideal types.</font>

907
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,530
<font color="signal">That's just what we call it,
among us.</font>

908
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:10,330
<font color="signal">The real title is too long, so...</font>

909
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,830
<font color="signal">What's so long about saying
"ideal type experiment?"</font>

910
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,730
<font color="signal">Um... even so...</font>

911
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:17,430
<font color="signal">Your cafe's name is Madame Antoine</font>

912
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,130
<font color="signal">and that's the center's name, too, so...</font>

913
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:22,330
<font color="signal">So you're saying that the experiment's
name is Madame Antoine, huh?</font>

914
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,030
<font color="signal">And what are the details
of the experiment, then?</font>

915
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,430
<font color="signal">You already know.</font>

916
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,030
<font color="signal">The relationship between your ideal type
and your immune system...</font>

917
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,330
<font color="signal">I need to use the bathroom.</font>

918
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,230
<font color="signal">Ji Ho!
Hey, Won Ji Ho!</font>

919
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,030
<font color="signal">Ms. Hye Rim.</font>

920
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,030
<font color="signal">Can you tell me my fortune?</font>

921
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,230
<font color="signal">Yes.
Of course.</font>

922
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,030
<font color="signal">Madame Antoine.</font>

923
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,830
<font color="signal">Did Professor Choi, by any chance...</font>

924
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,830
<font color="signal">ask you to be a part of an experiment?</font>

925
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,530
<font color="signal">Actually, that is...</font>

926
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:30,830
<font color="signal"><i>I'm asking you this as the
supervisor of the experiment.</i></font>

927
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,830
<font color="signal">What did she say?
Was it yes, or no?</font>

928
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,330
<font color="signal">A tentative yes?</font>

929
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:38,130
<font color="signal">When she saw the writing,
she laughed like this.</font>

930
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,830
<font color="signal">So I heard Seung Chan confessed to you.</font>

931
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,630
<font color="signal">Confessed?</font>

932
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:44,830
<font color="signal">Well, I don't know.
Does that count as a confession?</font>

933
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,830
<font color="signal">I don't know.</font>

934
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,430
<font color="signal">But what does that have to do with you?</font>

935
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,030
<font color="signal">What was your reply?</font>

936
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:53,130
<font color="signal">- What did Seung Chan tell you?
- He said that he was rejected.</font>

937
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,940
<font color="signal">Why is it that only lies
ever come out of your mouth?</font>

938
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,540
<font color="signal">I have good feelings toward him
and not so much toward you. Satisfied?</font>

939
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,960
<font color="signal">Are you saying that you like him
more than you like me?</font>

940
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,560
<font color="signal">What can I do about the fact
that I can't trust you?</font>

941
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,060
<font color="signal">I already apologized to you!</font>

942
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,160
<font color="signal">Did you think that everything
would be fine with just that?</font>

943
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,860
<font color="signal">All of your words and actions
are suspicious to me!</font>

944
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,860
<font color="signal">You have a supernatural
sense of perception, right?</font>

945
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:19,760
<font color="signal">Here. Scan me all over
with that sense of yours.</font>

946
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,160
<font color="signal">Dig out what's so
suspicious about me, then.</font>

947
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,160
<font color="signal">Is there anyone in the bathroom stall
next to me? (in French)</font>

948
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,960
<font color="signal">There isn't any toilet paper here.
(in French)</font>

949
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,460
<font color="signal">Can someone give me some toilet paper?
(in French)</font>

950
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,660
<font color="signal">All I have is my sock!
(in French)</font>

951
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,260
<font color="signal">What did Marie Antoinette say?</font>

952
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,860
<font color="signal">Did she say that she'd bring you
toilet paper?</font>

953
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,260
<font color="signal">She told me that you're doing an
experiment called "Madame" Antoine on me.</font>

954
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,660
<font color="signal">It's an experiment where
three men are made to approach a woman</font>

955
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,760
<font color="signal">to see who she'll fall in love with</font>

956
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,060
<font color="signal">and this is currently the second
preliminary version of this experiment.</font>

957
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:55,160
<font color="signal">The participants are Seung Chan,
Ji Ho, and you.</font>

958
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,860
<font color="signal">And you're supervising the experiment
while taking part in it.</font>

959
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,260
<font color="signal">It's incredible, isn't it?</font>

960
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,960
<font color="signal">But it seems that you've
come across an issue.</font>

961
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,060
<font color="signal">You've begun to actually like me.</font>

962
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,460
<font color="signal">The supervisor is supposed to be
completely impartial and unbiased</font>

963
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,360
<font color="signal">but that has become impossible now.</font>

964
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,060
<font color="signal">So you, Mr. Choi Soo Hyun,
who became flustered</font>

965
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,260
<font color="signal">told me that you'd see me
and then said you wouldn't.</font>

966
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,160
<font color="signal">Then you told me to quit my job
as a counselor at the center</font>

967
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,860
<font color="signal">and then took back what you said.
What a mess this all is.</font>

968
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,860
<font color="signal">Right?</font>

969
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,560
<font color="signal"><i>Tell me it isn't true.</i></font>

970
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,460
<font color="signal"><i>Tell me that you didn't pretend to
like me because of the experiment</i></font>

971
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,960
<font color="signal"><i>but that you actually really liked me.</i></font>

972
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,860
<font color="signal">You're not saying anything.</font>

973
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,660
<font color="signal">All right. Don't even think
of talking to me ever again.</font>

974
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,460
<font color="signal">You really...</font>

976
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,560

977
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,760
<font color="signal">What are you talking about?</font>

978
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,560
<font color="signal">So you're not doing a terrible
experiment on me?</font>

979
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,060
<font color="signal">No...</font>

980
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,760
