3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
Mr. Heo!

4
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,799
Die. Die!

5
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,100
Die, you bitch!
Die!

6
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,200
Your black magic
will be the death of you.

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,700
Your body will be torn to shreds
and fed to dogs!

8
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,900
And you'll die thusly,
without leaving behind a trace!

9
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,790
If you kill me, you'll never
be able to break your curse.

10
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:31,990
I don't care.
Your existence is curse enough!

11
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,391
A disgusting, evil curse that
just won't get away from me!

12
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:38,090
So, please, die!

13
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,490
I'll make you disappear so that you'll
never be able to pester me again.

14
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,490
I'll kill you.

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,490
No, Seo Ri!
You can't commit murder!

16
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:01,891
If you kill this woman,
all of the candles will go out.

17
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:07,391
Let's just take care
of Mr. Heo first, okay? Seo Ri!

18
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,591
Let's take care of Mr. Heo first.

19
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,620
Seo Ri.

20
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:48,890
What are you all doing?
Pursue the princess!

21
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,991
<i>[Episode 12]</i>

22
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:25,145
I'll grant you a leave,
so go to the princess right away.

23
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:26,745
What is the matter,
Your Highness?

24
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:30,344
Last night, Hong Joo left the
palace with her warriors.

25
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,944
Surely, the princess must be in danger!

26
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:34,944
What do you mean, the princess?

27
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,444
Who just said that?

28
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:49,344
What brings you here,
Your Highness?

29
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:53,645
I was taking a stroll, when I saw
you hurrying somewhere.

30
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:56,245
I grew worried, so I followed you.

31
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:59,645
Is something going on?

32
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,645
And what do you mean
by "the princess?"

33
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,145
Is there another princess besides
the one that I'm aware of?

34
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:17,045
Of course we should
have a princess, if anything.

35
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:20,444
You don't have an heir, after all.

36
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:26,345
I was talking with Sir Choi
regarding an heir to the throne.

37
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:35,345
And you're telling me that
that's what had you in such a frenzy?

38
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:40,345
What could be more important
or urgent than that?

39
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:45,345
There are some who say that we may
need to bring in a branch family member.

40
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:55,444
You're always talking
about a damned heir.

41
00:04:55,444 --> 00:05:00,245
That's all you can talk about,
even when I'm as ill as I am?

42
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:03,045
Your greed knows no bounds.

43
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:08,045
Your Highness, please do not worry.

44
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:12,545
You are fated to have many heirs,
so once you make a complete recovery

45
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,644
you will soon be able to see an heir.

46
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:19,245
I will prepare an offering for the
strengthening of his constitution.

47
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:25,944
Oh, really?
What a great thing to hear.

48
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:31,644
Sungsuchung and the Imperial Taoists
are going to such great lengths for me

49
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:37,045
so how is it that my affliction
only grows worse, day after day?

50
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,545
It's a disease that even the
royal doctor could not cure.

51
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:44,144
So how could you expect it to get
miraculously better overnight?

52
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,745
Tell me, Chief of the
Imperial Taoist Branch.

53
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:54,444
Is the reason that Sungsuchung's Chief
Shamaness's prayers have been futile

54
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:57,545
because her intellect is lacking?

55
00:05:57,545 --> 00:06:00,345
Or is there another reason for this?

56
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:15,944
You know. Ill intentions,
sabotage, or something like that.

57
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,144
According to what the
heavens have told me

58
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:24,144
the one who has brought all this
calamity to our land is Hong Joo.

59
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:27,845
It's because you've turned away
from everyone else's council but hers

60
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:32,045
that your once-faithful
subjects are now leaving you.

61
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:35,944
Therefore, I will rid her
from this palace.

62
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:41,245
Such are the sentiments that my
heartfelt prayers will be based upon.

63
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:58,144
Poong Yeon sure does take
after you in many ways.

64
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:08,644
However, if what you said just now
was not merely advice to me

65
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:15,345
it would be no different than a
direct attack toward me, the king.

66
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:22,845
Furthermore, if you are
trying to stab me in the back...

67
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:31,944
Queen Shim, who is standing behind me,
will have to pay the price as well.

68
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,745
<i>This death is your fault
this time around, as well.</i>

69
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:27,944
I think we've managed
to lose her warriors.

70
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:31,745
How is Mr. Heo doing?

71
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,544
He won't open his eyes.

72
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:37,445
She only broke the holy seal
on him with black magic

73
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:41,544
so I'm sure that he'll be fine.
He'll definitely awaken.

74
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:44,345
This is all because of my curse.

75
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:47,345
It's all because of my curse
that Joon is dead.

76
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,544
I never should have
given him my heart.

77
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:54,345
It's all because of this
forsaken heart of mine!

78
00:08:55,445 --> 00:09:00,945
Sir Monk. Please go to my father
and ask him to find us another talisman.

79
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:05,644
You're in grave danger right now because
you don't have a talisman with you.

80
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,345
Will you be all right on your own?

81
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:10,445
- That doesn't matter.
- All right, then.

82
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,144
I'll be back.

83
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:29,345
Are you all right?
Let me examine you.

84
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,245
Why didn't you chase after the princess?

85
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:35,745
You were gravely injured, so--

86
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:39,245
If you really had my best interest
in mind, you should've pursued her.

87
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:44,245
My body acted before I could
think things over properly.

88
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,845
I offer you my deepest apologies.

89
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,745
Where are you planning to go,
with your body in that state?

90
00:09:56,445 --> 00:10:01,745
She didn't seem to have gotten very far.

91
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:04,445
I must go and search for her myself.

92
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:08,745
Chief Shamaness!
Chief Shamaness!

93
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:11,345
Chief Shamaness!

94
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:17,745
Chief Shamaness!

95
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:22,845
It seems that the king
knows about the princess.

96
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:30,345
If you send soldiers hastily, the entire
country may find out about the princess.

97
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:32,544
Please head back for now, Your Highness.

98
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,644
I'll do my best to deal
with this situation.

99
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:38,345
I'm sure that the king will use
the princess to pressure me.

100
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:46,345
The princess must not be captured.
For her sake, and the country's sake.

101
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:00,945
Sir!

102
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,845
I don't know how Hong Joo found
out about Chungbing Temple.

103
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:07,945
She stabbed Mr. Heo, and the
holy seal on him was broken!

104
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,845
Hong Joo sustained some injuries as well

105
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:12,144
but I'm sure she'll be pursuing
us again soon enough.

106
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:13,745
What do we do now?

107
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:20,945
The curse has spread to Mr. Heo,
and Yeon Hui is alone right now.

108
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:24,544
Sir. We must make haste. Quickly!

109
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:28,044
Take Yeon Hui and stay hidden
for as long as you can.

110
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:30,945
What? You're not coming with me?

111
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:35,245
The talisman is our first priority. I'll
have to find a way to create a new one.

112
00:11:57,544 --> 00:12:02,044
What are you doing?
You can't. It's dangerous!

113
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:06,445
This is the only method we have left.

114
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,644
Are you not aware of your
body's current condition?

115
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,544
You're dying right now!

116
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:13,044
This is the only thing left
that I can do.

117
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:16,745
I'll proceed with this as soon as
I regain some of my strength

118
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:20,644
so stay on the move
with Yeon Hui until then.

119
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:21,644
Sir!

120
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:25,144
Go to Poong Yeon and ask for his aid.

121
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:34,345
There's someone that Mr. Heo
knows in Banchon.

122
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:38,644
I'll take Yeon Hui there first.

123
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:47,644
Yoh Gwang.
Bring me the Oblivion Potion.

124
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:50,845
What?

125
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:27,745
Heo Joon.

126
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:10,845
Don't go. Please.
Please, don't go.

127
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,644
Mr. Heo!
Mr. Heo!

128
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:44,544
What happened with the talisman?

129
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:46,144
Sir Choi is searching for
a method right now.

130
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:49,745
But until then, we must remain
on the move. So let's hurry.

131
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:53,945
Come to your senses, Mr. Heo!
Hurry and get up!

132
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:20,544
We must hurry, as well.

133
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:53,445
<i>Is that man named Heo Joon
close to Yeon Hui?</i>

134
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:57,345
A cursed seal has appeared on Mr. Heo.

135
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:11,445
- Where's the person looking for me?
- Over in that room.

136
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:15,644
They seem like weird people, though.
We can't take them in, okay?

137
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:18,144
- Okay.
- Sheesh! Hurry up!

138
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:26,644
So what's this urgent matter
you mentioned?

139
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:35,745
Huh? What's with him?

140
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:41,144
<i>What happens when one
falls prey to the curse?</i>

141
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:43,745
If Yeon Hui cannot break the curse

142
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:46,544
he will be ill for half a month,
before succumbing to death.

143
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:50,044
Is that the true nature
of Yeon Hui's curse?

144
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:56,644
Her curse is to be forced to watch
helplessly as her loved one dies.

145
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,745
You were only safe before

146
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:04,144
because Yeon Hui was within the
holy confines of Chungbing Temple.

147
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:07,244
Is there no other safe place
than Chungbing Temple?

148
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:09,845
Not that I know of.

149
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:12,845
It was difficult enough for us
to even find Chungbing Temple.

150
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:16,444
It'll be too difficult to continue
fleeing if Heo Joon is with you.

151
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:21,045
Leave Heo Joon here.
I'll accompany you.

152
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:24,144
But even so, leaving behind
a sick person is a bit...

153
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,244
He can barely walk properly.

154
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:30,345
Taking him with us will put
Yeon Hui in greater danger.

155
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:32,845
I guess it cannot be helped, then.

156
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,845
We can't let Yeon Hui
get injured, after all.

157
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:41,244
Seo Ri!

158
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:49,845
Abracadabra... ahh!

159
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:52,845
Abracadabra!

160
00:17:56,644 --> 00:18:00,444
Hey, you! If you're a ghost,
leave immediately

161
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:03,845
and if you're Heo Joon,
get up right now!

162
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,444
What's this?

163
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:23,244
Can you look into that symbol for me?

164
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:30,644
I think it's a symbol letting one know
one's affiliations, or something.

165
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:38,845
<i>I don't need your help,
Older Brother.</i>

166
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,744
So please leave.

167
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:45,144
Are you acting this way because
I proposed that he be left behind?

168
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:50,944
Older Brother. If you're doing
this out of concern for me...

169
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:54,644
please don't.

170
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:57,444
Is that man that important to you?

171
00:18:57,444 --> 00:19:00,944
Is he so important to you that
you'd cast me aside like this?

172
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:05,744
Just what was I to you, then?

173
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,345
The older brother that I dearly miss...

174
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:16,744
is one who'd understand me
when I was upset.

175
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:25,644
He was kind, and told me that everyone
had a reason for being born.

176
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:33,244
The Yeon Hui that I so desperately
searched for, for five years

177
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:40,545
was a kind girl who always trusted me,
and always held my hand.

178
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:44,744
No. What you missed was a
foolish girl who was ignorant

179
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:54,845
of everything outside of the Black
Forest, and clung to your every word.

180
00:19:56,444 --> 00:20:02,744
But that girl no longer exists.

181
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:12,845
The reason you became this way
is all because of that damned curse.

182
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,944
I will restore you to who you once were

183
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:21,845
even if I must kill everyone
who made you this way.

184
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,744
Have you awakened, ma'am?

185
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:18,744
What brings you all the way here?

186
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,744
If you refuse me,
I will have your head.

187
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:23,444
Tell me, how can I restore Yeon Hui
to the way she once was?

188
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:28,144
- Please, have a seat.
- You brought the curse upon her.

189
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:31,944
I don't care about the curse, though.

190
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:34,744
All you have to do is revert her
to the way she once was.

191
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:41,345
I really love the look in your eyes.

192
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:47,045
The one who inflicted pain on one's
heart does not know how that pain feels.

193
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:49,444
Nor do they realize how
cruel they'd been.

194
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:51,144
You insolent wench!

195
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,845
Don't you go mouthing off as you wish!

196
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:57,744
Do you think that her heart will revert
to the way it was if you kill me?

197
00:21:57,744 --> 00:22:02,644
Who knows? Her heart may never
have been yours to begin with.

198
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:05,744
Your disgusting magic
has ruined everything.

199
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:09,045
The fact that Yeon Hui has changed,
and the king is in his current state

200
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:12,845
is all due to your evil
black magic, is it not?

201
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:18,244
I only learned how to use this evil
black magic due to your father.

202
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:22,644
You didn't know that I was his disciple?

203
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:26,244
Stop spouting nonsense.

204
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:30,744
I was a mere court lady.

205
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:42,244
I faced many hardships, and Sir Choi
was the only one I could depend on.

206
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:43,545
Hong Joo!

207
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:50,345
Hong Joo!

208
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:05,944
What happened?

209
00:23:06,444 --> 00:23:09,345
They tried to kill me.

210
00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:16,444
They dragged me away, and tried to
make me have the king's heir by force

211
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:20,644
and tried to kill me when things
didn't go the way they'd planned.

212
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:26,244
There's no way that
I'll just let this slide.

213
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:31,744
I will definitely make
them pay for this!

214
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,144
I understand how upset you must feel.

215
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,944
But you must cast aside your
hatred to live your life in peace.

216
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:41,845
How could you possibly say that to me?

217
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:49,444
I'm neither a virgin, nor a
proper human being anymore.

218
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:55,845
Hong Joo. You're quite a talented child.

219
00:23:55,845 --> 00:24:02,244
But if you harbor grudges,
your powers may become twisted.

220
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:13,944
I'll help you, so let's begin anew.

221
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:27,144
You need a lot of mental and physical
energy to create a holy talisman.

222
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:30,144
Furthermore, you must pour
your life energy into making it

223
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:33,444
so it may be difficult for
you to recover afterwards.

224
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:37,845
Isn't it quite dangerous to do, then?

225
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:40,444
Must I really learn such things?

226
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:46,244
Hong Joo. You must use magic
for the greater good.

227
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:51,744
You must be willing to throw everything
away if it's for the greater good.

228
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,744
What did I just say?

229
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:04,944
"You must be willing to throw everything
away if it's for the greater good."

230
00:25:04,944 --> 00:25:08,845
But I don't know why
I must learn such things.

231
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:13,744
I'm learning these things
in order to protect myself

232
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:16,845
and so that I won't have
anything else taken from me.

233
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:20,244
You must cast aside that greed
and self-serving attitude!

234
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:23,744
Aren't I learning all of this
so that I can become greater?

235
00:25:23,744 --> 00:25:32,644
Hate. Rage. Jealously. These are
dangerous for a shaman to feel.

236
00:25:34,944 --> 00:25:39,244
If you're harboring such feelings,
quit learning from me immediately.

237
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:49,845
If one can quell such terrible
feelings, and learn magic

238
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:53,045
can one gain the power to win
someone's heart, as well?

239
00:25:55,144 --> 00:26:00,345
If you must win them over with magic,
they are not true affections.

240
00:26:30,744 --> 00:26:34,345
<i>They took everything from you.</i>

241
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:38,744
<i>And they've made it so that you
can never have anything ever again.</i>

242
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,845
<i>I didn't learn black magic
from Sir Choi</i>

243
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:19,845
but he stopped me out of guilt,
since I was once his pupil.

244
00:27:20,345 --> 00:27:23,644
And that's how I ended up this way.

245
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:41,545
The sadness that you're
feeling right now

246
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:44,244
and your despair, that is
even deeper than your sadness...

247
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:46,345
it's not your fault at all
that you're feeling such emotions.

248
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:53,744
You're merely paying for
your father's mistake.

249
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:58,244
And who is the one who
forsook your love?

250
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:02,944
It is the fault of those
who have wronged you.

251
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,545
So hate those people, instead.
Channel your rage toward them.

252
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:09,045
All you must do is forget.

253
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:13,744
I'm only telling you these things
with your best interest in mind.

254
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:16,244
This is the only way
you can survive.

255
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:26,045
If it's all Father's fault,
I'll make things right on his behalf.

256
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:29,345
So don't you ever go spouting your
nonsense at me, ever again.

257
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:34,345
You'll be asking me for help,
sooner or later.

258
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:10,144
Let me ask you this, as the
captain of the royal guard.

259
00:29:10,644 --> 00:29:13,944
Why did you save the princess?

260
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:18,144
Answer me.
This is an order.

261
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:34,444
What is it that you heard?

262
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,744
Let me ask you this,
as your son.

263
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:50,845
Why couldn't you stop Hong Joo?

264
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:55,744
Why did you let her live
when she uses black magic?

265
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:58,944
I believed that I could
make her good again.

266
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:04,144
I wished for Hong Joo to forsake
her sinful life, since she was my pupil.

267
00:30:04,144 --> 00:30:06,345
Did you trust her?

268
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:12,944
If you truly are the one who caused this
curse, I must charge you with that crime.

269
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,944
Answer me!

270
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:23,045
If you pose any sort of
danger to Yeon Hui

271
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:26,045
what must I do, then?

272
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:29,045
Isn't it only natural that
I cannot trust you

273
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:35,444
if you're still compassionate
toward her?

274
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:37,845
Do not trust me.

275
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:46,644
You're right. The reason why Yeon Hui
was cursed is because I let Hong Joo go.

276
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:52,444
And the reason why you cannot accept
Yeon Hui is because I deceived you.

277
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:56,944
No... do not trust me.

278
00:30:57,444 --> 00:31:02,244
I'm going to break Yeon Hui's
curse for her.

279
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:17,445
<i>- What did you just say?</i>
- I cannot do as you command.

280
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:20,346
You're saying that you cannot
bring the princess before me?

281
00:31:23,645 --> 00:31:25,645
Poong Yeon!

282
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:35,547
Didn't you say that you'd
lay down your life for me?

283
00:31:35,547 --> 00:31:38,846
I will receive the punishment for
not heeding your command

284
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:44,346
and my father's crime
of letting the princess live.

285
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:49,346
Please, do not forgive me
of these crimes.

286
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:01,747
Say that again.

287
00:32:02,846 --> 00:32:05,547
Say it again, damn you!

288
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:16,547
You are no longer the
captain of the royal guard.

289
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:22,747
And you are no longer
my cherished friend, either.

290
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:33,346
Leave. And do not ever show
your face in the palace again.

291
00:32:53,047 --> 00:33:01,747
Please strengthen your resolve,
and please take care of your health.

292
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:28,047
Evil spirits, begone!
Evil spirits, begone!

293
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,747
What are you doing in
front of someone else's room?

294
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:35,846
- Hey, what are you doing? Sheesh!
- Be still!

295
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:41,247
- Evil spirits, begone!
- What are you talking about?

296
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,877
That guy is possessed by spirits,
so why is this one fine?

297
00:33:46,877 --> 00:33:49,078
He's not possessed.
He's just--

298
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:54,479
They're just a bit ill
right now, is all.

299
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:57,578
Ill? What kind of illness
could they have?

300
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:00,877
Listen. There are so many
criminals in Banchon

301
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,377
that you'll be kicked out of here
immediately if you seem even a bit off.

302
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:05,278
But you people are
just way too strange!

303
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,378
Heo Joon is on the run for a
crime that he didn't commit...

304
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:12,777
But... what's up
with you two? Huh?

305
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:17,777
We're being pursued, and by
really scary people, at that.

306
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:24,478
So please, help us out a bit
so that we can leave here safely!

307
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,878
I'm begging you.

308
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:35,079
Hey, what are you doing?

309
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,478
Geez, just from the looks of you--

310
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:39,579
Stop it, already!

311
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,777
Let go!

312
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:49,579
- Why, you little--
- You creep!

313
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:53,378
- When did I ever--
- Let go!

314
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:54,978
Why, you -- ow!

315
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:58,878
Hey! Hey!

316
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:04,079
- Oh, you're here, sir?
- Where is Heo Joon?

317
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,978
- He's in this room.
- Did you bring what I asked for?

318
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:35,478
This is the Oblivion Potion.

319
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:39,978
I'm sure you're better aware
of what this is than I am.

320
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:46,579
If you drink this, you'll lose all your
memories regarding Yeon Hui

321
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,777
and it'll save your life.

322
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:54,478
This is the only way you can survive.

323
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,579
Are you telling me to run away
like a coward?

324
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:08,079
If you die, Yeon Hui will be left to
shoulder all the misery alone.

325
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,579
This isn't completely for your sake.
It's for Yeon Hui's sake, too.

326
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:31,878
I'm sorry, but these memories are a
precious gift to me from Yeon Hui.

327
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:35,677
I cannot forget her.

328
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:44,079
I'll survive somehow,
and protect her no matter what.

329
00:37:53,277 --> 00:37:56,277
<i>Those feelings must
be strong enough</i>

330
00:37:56,277 --> 00:38:01,478
<i>for you to be able to sacrifice
yourself for her in the end.</i>

331
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:07,079
<i>You must be the one to
light the 108th candle.</i>

332
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,378
Father.

333
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:26,978
- Please, don't do that.
- Hong Joo will make her move soon.

334
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:30,177
Please move to another place
as soon as you can.

335
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,378
What about the talisman?

336
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:36,978
I'll make you one while
you flee from Hong Joo.

337
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:39,378
Is there a safe place for us to go?

338
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:44,478
Won't Hong Joo chase me
no matter where I go?

339
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:52,378
I will write a letter to Queen Shim,
so please deliver it to her.

340
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:08,277
Is this what the princess wants?

341
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,579
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Will this be all right?

342
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:15,878
Won't it be too dangerous?

343
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:20,478
I also believe that this is the
best measure for her to take.

344
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:27,777
Well, this is a request that she
has made, so I must help her.

345
00:39:29,478 --> 00:39:34,177
I'll leave the rest to you.

346
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:49,478
This is improper behavior
for a lady, you know.

347
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,978
Looks like you're only able to hold
back because you're such a manly man.

348
00:39:57,878 --> 00:40:02,079
Hurry and break the curse, and save me.

349
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:14,579
Don't ever let go of this
hand, all right?

350
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,777
Because I have no intention
of letting go, either.

351
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:26,579
I'm leaving tomorrow.

352
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,277
There really is no place left
for me to return to anymore.

353
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:36,777
Is it because of me?

354
00:40:39,878 --> 00:40:42,878
No, it's so that I can live.

355
00:40:43,378 --> 00:40:50,478
And so that I can figure out
who I am, and where I can go.

356
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:09,978
We're already on the same side.

357
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,978
I have to catch
the Red Gentleman's Robe

358
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:19,878
and you have to catch the woman
controlling that murderer.

359
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:27,277
We're on the same side, so
we have common enemies, huh?

360
00:41:32,978 --> 00:41:38,878
Since we're on the same side,
I'll let you be our side's leader.

361
00:41:38,878 --> 00:41:41,579
You intimidate me a little, you see.

362
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:45,978
So I'm willing to be
really obedient to you.

363
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:54,579
Don't worry about me, and go.
Just don't get hurt.

364
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,677
I'll come and find you.

365
00:42:02,878 --> 00:42:07,978
We'll definitely meet again. For sure.

366
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:37,978
Eunuch Kim.
Eunuch Kim!

367
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:43,777
You called for me, Your Highness?

368
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:49,579
Bring me the one who was promoted due
to the Red Gentleman's Robe incident.

369
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:01,478
If you're one of my men, I'm sure you're
ready to cast your life aside for me.

370
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,777
Of course, Your Highness!

371
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:17,277
Then I'm sure that you won't have
any qualms even if I beheaded you.

372
00:43:17,277 --> 00:43:21,079
Um, why, exactly...

373
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:27,378
You dared to lie to me
about the Red Gentleman's Robe?

374
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:33,378
I... I really knew nothing about that!
They looked similar to me, so -- ahh!

375
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:39,677
I really did not know
that the body was a fake!

376
00:43:40,277 --> 00:43:45,978
Please kill me, Your Highness!

377
00:43:45,978 --> 00:43:49,978
Since you asked me to kill you,
I'll go ahead and do it.

378
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,478
But if you were to give your
life to me, and do as I say

379
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,677
I may revisit my decision.
So, what will you do?

380
00:44:11,677 --> 00:44:15,579
I'll do anything you command
me to, Your Highness!

381
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:19,978
Chase Choi Poong Yeon,
and bring me his sister.

382
00:44:19,978 --> 00:44:22,478
His... sister?

383
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:25,579
She's his treasured little sister.

384
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:30,378
He refused to bring her to me,
so I must force her here.

385
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:37,079
I think I know a way.
How about making a royal decree?

386
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:44,079
Just do as I've commanded,
and bring her here.

387
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,677
Yes, sir! I will bring that
girl to you without fail!

388
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:56,079
What will you do now?

389
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,478
I've lost the king's favor
for Yeon Hui's sake.

390
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:00,878
I have no intention
of evading her anymore.

391
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:45,579
How did you get a palanquin?

392
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:48,978
Um, that is...

393
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:52,579
I'll have a look around
the surrounding area.

394
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:53,978
All right.

395
00:46:32,277 --> 00:46:34,079
Yeon Hui!

396
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:54,978
No! No!

397
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:02,677
Mr. Heo!
Mr. Heo!

398
00:47:05,177 --> 00:47:07,378
Are you hurt?

399
00:47:08,177 --> 00:47:10,478
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

400
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:17,677
It's not my blood.

401
00:47:21,777 --> 00:47:27,277
I've lost them. I think they know
she's here, so hurry and go.

402
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:36,378
I heard everything from Sir Monk. I'll
watch over this man, so hurry and go.

403
00:47:37,777 --> 00:47:40,777
Let's hurry.
We don't have time.

404
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:36,478
Stop it!

405
00:48:37,478 --> 00:48:39,677
Don't do it.

406
00:48:42,478 --> 00:48:46,079
What's this?
Huh?

407
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:08,378
Chase after that palanquin!
The princess is in there!

408
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,378
Yes, ma'am!

409
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,677
Move out of the way!
It's the Queen!

410
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:59,978
Move aside.

411
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:09,677
What brings you outside of the temple?

412
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:12,079
Have you hidden the princess?

413
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:19,579
The princess? Are you talking about the
princess you told me was dead?

414
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,579
Are you planning to oppose me once more?

415
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,878
Have I not acquiesced to you?

416
00:50:28,378 --> 00:50:31,277
Couldn't you tell that from
the fact that I spared you

417
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:35,478
even though you lied about
the princess being dead?

418
00:50:36,478 --> 00:50:41,777
It seems that I've been keeping you.
Please, be on your way.

419
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,978
I'm in no rush.

420
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:48,777
Seeing my son reminded me of my
husband, so I'm going to visit his grave.

421
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:51,878
Would you like to join me?

422
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:55,378
I have an urgent matter to look into.

423
00:50:55,378 --> 00:50:59,277
Is it important enough that you'd
dare to reject my invitation?

424
00:50:59,277 --> 00:51:02,277
They're matters that have
to do with Sungsuchung.

425
00:51:02,277 --> 00:51:06,579
They're important to me, but not
important enough for you to know about.

426
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:13,677
Is that right? Eunuch Park.
Let's get going.

427
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:17,579
Move out of the way!
It's the Queen!

428
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,878
Move out of the way!
It's the Queen!

429
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:33,579
<i>I'll go to the palace.</i>

430
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:35,777
What do you mean by that?

431
00:51:35,777 --> 00:51:37,579
There are some instances where
the most dangerous place

432
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,677
can also end up being
the safest place.

433
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:43,478
I cannot live on the run any longer.

434
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:47,177
I must make it so that they
can never pursue me again.

435
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,378
Please listen to me carefully.

436
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:57,777
When I became the Head
of the Imperial Taoist Branch

437
00:51:57,777 --> 00:52:00,878
I did it with a resolve to protect
the country at all costs.

438
00:52:00,878 --> 00:52:03,878
And the reason I'm creating
a talisman for you

439
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:06,378
is due to that resolve.

440
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:11,677
So even if I die, you must not
be shaken by feelings of guilt.

441
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:14,177
What are you saying?

442
00:52:14,177 --> 00:52:19,878
If you must risk your life to craft a
talisman, Father, I have no need for it.

443
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:23,378
I'm letting you know in advance because
the work I'm doing is dangerous.

444
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:24,677
Be not afraid, Your Highness

445
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:28,079
and go to the Queen right away
as soon as you get a talisman.

446
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,277
She will most certainly
lend you her aid.

447
00:52:30,777 --> 00:52:32,878
Father.

448
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:40,277
I feel relieved now that I see
how brave you've become.

449
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:49,579
Where is the princess?

450
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:02,478
It's "Her Highness, the Princess."
Do not speak so insolently.

451
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,219
You risked your life
for such a futile cause?

452
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:14,818
I have no regrets.

453
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:18,719
You wouldn't understand

454
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:26,318
because you've never risked
your life to protect someone.

455
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:31,219
Did I not tell you that this
would cost you your life?

456
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:43,518
Give me your hand.
I will save you.

457
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:49,619
I'd prefer it if you killed me instead.

458
00:56:55,217 --> 00:57:02,219
I guess I'm fated to watch you die.

459
00:57:04,518 --> 00:57:14,818
I regret... ever letting you live.

460
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:06,719
You've heard of "hyulmyung," right?

461
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,719
It means, "blood-bound fate."

462
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:11,619
From now on...
we'll be one until we die.

463
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,719
They say that this symbol is that
of the Amsagol Homeless Girls.

464
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,496
I checked them out, and this symbol
was on a lot of girls' shoulders.

465
00:59:56,496 --> 00:59:57,596
You're sure that they
were women, right?

466
00:59:57,596 --> 01:00:00,394
They only capture girls,
and mistreat them

467
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:04,096
and sell them to brothels
when they get older. Bastards.

468
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:07,394
So, what are you going to do now?

469
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:11,496
My suspicions have been confirmed,
so I have to check for myself now...

470
01:00:13,195 --> 01:00:16,596
<i>whether or not the one
who figured out our location</i>

471
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:20,096
<i>at Chungbing Temple and Banchon...
may actually be a woman.</i>

472
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:22,195
Oh!

473
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:30,394
What are you doing?

474
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:36,195
I came here to thank you personally.

475
01:00:36,195 --> 01:00:39,394
You know, it really took a lot
of effort to find this place!

476
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:46,195
Here's a gift for you.

477
01:00:46,195 --> 01:00:50,096
You hurt your arm, didn't you? I used
to be beat up a lot when I was younger

478
01:00:50,096 --> 01:00:52,295
so I know how to make the most
effective salves for injuries.

479
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:57,496
I was going to make you some before, but
we were attacked at Chungbing Temple.

480
01:00:57,496 --> 01:01:00,496
Anyway, sorry for the delay.
Here.

481
01:01:01,996 --> 01:01:03,894
I don't need this.

482
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:24,596
Look here. I know you're injured,
so I can't just let you get it infected.

483
01:01:33,695 --> 01:01:36,195
Are you all right, sir?

484
01:01:37,996 --> 01:01:40,295
Sir.

485
01:01:55,695 --> 01:02:00,795
Where is the princess?
Take me to her.

486
01:02:03,795 --> 01:02:06,096
Sir!

487
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:13,596
I'm sure that the princess
will have left the palace by now.

488
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:17,195
If we can't find her,
we'll have to drag her out.

- Please... please, don't go!</i>

497
01:03:23,195 --> 01:03:24,596
<i>you must watch the person
you love die before you.</i>

498
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:27,996
<i>This is the only way
that you can survive.</i>

499
01:03:27,996 --> 01:03:30,096
<i>I can't forget about Yeon Hui.
I'll protect her, for sure.</i>

500
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:31,596
<i>I can no longer live
my life on the run.</i>

501
01:03:31,596 --> 01:03:34,096
<i>I'll go to the palace.</i>
