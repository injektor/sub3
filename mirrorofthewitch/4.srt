3
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:29,422
<font color="yellow">Hey, Persimmon.
Why are you here?</font>

4
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:35,722
<font color="yellow">Older Brother...</font>

6
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:05,121
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?
And is she sick?</font>

7
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:08,621
<font color="yellow">Her body is cold, and she's quite pale.</font>

8
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:11,822
<font color="yellow">I think it'd be best
to bring her to a physician...</font>

9
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:26,822
<font color="yellow">Oh, um... don't misunderstand.
Um, this is like a work uniform for me.</font>

10
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:32,022
<font color="yellow">And it's not that kind of job... I'm
selling something nowadays, and--</font>

11
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:36,421
<font color="yellow">Do you know my little sister,
by any chance?</font>

12
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:41,721
<font color="yellow">Uh, no.</font>

13
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:47,421
<font color="yellow">At any rate, thank you for helping her.</font>

14
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:51,921
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of her from here
on in, so you can go.</font>

15
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:54,121
<font color="yellow">Then, goodbye.</font>

16
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:18,322
<font color="yellow">So that stiff was her older brother?</font>

17
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:23,222
<font color="yellow">They're not alike at all.</font>

18
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:31,921
<font color="yellow">I wonder if that girl will be okay?
She looked really unwell.</font>

19
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:37,122
<font color="yellow">Oh, whatever! I should be more
worried about myself right now.</font>

20
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:53,021
<font color="yellow">Mother!
Mother!</font>

21
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:34,922
<font color="yellow">- Poong Yeon!
- Poong Yeon!</font>

22
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:46,221
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui!
Yeon Hui!</font>

23
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:55,422
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui! Yeon Hui!
Yeon Hui! Wake up!</font>

24
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:57,922
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui!</font>

25
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:02,721
<font color="yellow">- Why did you do that?
- Father.</font>

26
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:05,922
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you listen
to what I told you?</font>

27
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,822
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

28
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:15,322
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Why... is this happening to me?</font>

29
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:23,221
<font color="yellow">I'm so scared, Father.
Please, save me.</font>

30
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:36,422
<font color="yellow">How could this have happened?
I asked you a question!</font>

31
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:48,922
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say that he'd be fine?</font>

32
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,922
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say that
nothing would happen to him?</font>

33
00:05:55,021 --> 00:06:06,021
<font color="yellow">So what's this, then? Save him,
right now! Save him! Save him!</font>

34
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,822
<font color="yellow">Eunuch Park, escort the Queen out.</font>

35
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:14,521
<font color="yellow">Your Highness, please calm down!</font>

36
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:29,922
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince... please, open your eyes.
This can't happen. You can't die!</font>

37
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:35,721
<font color="yellow">You can't!
Please, open your eyes!</font>

38
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:39,322
<font color="yellow">Please, no!</font>

39
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:44,922
<font color="yellow">- Queen Shim!
- Your Highness!</font>

40
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,922
<font color="yellow">Help her up.</font>

41
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,622
<font color="yellow">Choi Hyun Seo.</font>

42
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,021
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

43
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:24,822
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go of me, bastards!</font>

44
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:26,221
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

45
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:36,822
<font color="yellow">- Lady Sohn.
- I thought you were a clever child</font>

46
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:40,422
<font color="yellow">but it seems to me that you're
not aware of your place.</font>

47
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:46,322
<font color="yellow">Therefore, I'll thoroughly
educate you tonight.</font>

48
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:49,122
<font color="yellow">Just what exactly are
you planning to do?</font>

49
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:52,422
<font color="yellow">Please, stop.
Please!</font>

50
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,822
<font color="yellow">Begin.</font>

51
00:07:55,622 --> 00:08:01,622
<font color="yellow">No! No! No!
Stop that, right now!</font>

52
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:11,122
<font color="yellow">No! No! Stop!
Mother! Mother! Mother!</font>

53
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,822
<font color="yellow">- Stay still!
- Mother!</font>

54
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:16,521
<font color="yellow">Mother! Mo--</font>

55
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:27,221
<font color="yellow">Mother! Mother!
Mother!</font>

56
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:37,721
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
So please, tell them to stop!</font>

57
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:44,922
<font color="yellow">Please, tell them to stop!
Please! Please! Let her live!</font>

58
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:49,922
<font color="yellow">- Please! Let her live!
- Stop.</font>

59
00:08:56,322 --> 00:09:02,022
<font color="yellow">I heard that you've been working hard
to buy your mother's ownership papers.</font>

60
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:14,221
<font color="yellow">Joon. There's one thing that people
misunderstand as they go through life.</font>

61
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:18,322
<font color="yellow">They mistakenly believe that they can
escape their wretched situations in life</font>

62
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:20,022
<font color="yellow">if only they work hard.</font>

63
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:26,221
<font color="yellow">However, there's something you can't
escape, no matter how hard you work.</font>

64
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:30,022
<font color="yellow">Do you know what that is?</font>

65
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:35,221
<font color="yellow">It's your parentage.</font>

66
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:40,322
<font color="yellow">A parent who is affluent
can offer their child a lavish life.</font>

67
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:44,922
<font color="yellow">However, the only thing that poor
parents can offer their children</font>

68
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:50,422
<font color="yellow">is the sheer pathetic
nature of their life.</font>

69
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:55,721
<font color="yellow">Since parents pass on the quality
of their lives to their children</font>

70
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,022
<font color="yellow">you should never have been born.</font>

71
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:02,322
<font color="yellow">You should never have
been born into this world!</font>

72
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:07,721
<font color="yellow">Not being born would've been best
for both you and your mother.</font>

73
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:14,121
<font color="yellow">But, who can you blame now?</font>

74
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:19,721
<font color="yellow">You can only blame your own cursed life,
for being born to such a mother.</font>

75
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:24,721
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything.
Don't try to escape your wretched fate.</font>

76
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:29,822
<font color="yellow">Don't try to fight against it, either.
Just live as if you were dead.</font>

77
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:34,721
<font color="yellow">That's the only way you
and your mother can survive.</font>

78
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,221
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

79
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:40,621
<font color="yellow">Y-y-y-yes!</font>

80
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:02,022
<font color="yellow">Heed my words. If you didn't
understand what I told you today</font>

81
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:07,422
<font color="yellow">your mother will really
be in there next time.</font>

82
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,422
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

83
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,922
<font color="yellow">Let's run away from this place.</font>

84
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:51,422
<font color="yellow">Poong Yeon! How is it that you
can't swallow even a drop of medicine?</font>

85
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:55,022
<font color="yellow">Poong Yeon!
Please, come to your senses!</font>

86
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:59,322
<font color="yellow">- M-m-mother.
- Poong Yeon.</font>

87
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:03,422
<font color="yellow">Have you regained consciousness?
Are you all right now?</font>

88
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:16,621
<font color="yellow">- Poong Yeon!
- A ghost!</font>

89
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:21,121
<font color="yellow">- Go away!
- What's the matter?</font>

90
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,822
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting this way?
Please, Poong Yeon--</font>

91
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,721
<font color="yellow">A ghost! A ghost!</font>

92
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:30,121
<font color="yellow">Look at me, Poong Yeon.
Look at your mother!</font>

93
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:33,322
<font color="yellow">- A ghost!
- Poong Yeon!</font>

94
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:20,121
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui!</font>

95
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:30,221
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui! Yeon Hui!
Yeon Hui!</font>

96
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,322
<font color="yellow"><i>Her powers are unstable at the moment.</i></font>

97
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,922
<font color="yellow"><i>When she releases energy,
she loses consciousness</i></font>

98
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,322
<font color="yellow">so we cannot move her yet.</font>

99
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:38,721
<font color="yellow">The spell on the Black Forest
is beginning to break.</font>

100
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:41,221
<font color="yellow">We must move her as soon as possible!</font>

101
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:44,822
<font color="yellow">But what if she ends up being noticed
by Hong Joo while we're doing that?</font>

102
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:46,721
<font color="yellow">That'll really mean the
end for all of this!</font>

103
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:50,022
<font color="yellow">But if we leave her like that, she,
the Crown Prince, and Poong Yeon</font>

104
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:52,322
<font color="yellow">will all end up perishing!</font>

105
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:54,721
<font color="yellow">If we do that, Yoh Gwang
could fall into danger, too!</font>

106
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:58,322
<font color="yellow">What are we supposed to do, then?
There's no other way!</font>

107
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,721
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

108
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:33,422
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much. Your father
will take care of everything.</font>

109
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:41,022
<font color="yellow">We can restore everything back to the
way it was if we go to Chungbing Temple.</font>

110
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,422
<font color="yellow">Chungbing Temple?</font>

111
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:53,922
<font color="yellow">What kind of place is that?</font>

112
00:16:53,922 --> 00:17:02,322
<font color="yellow">Well, that's... I'll tell you when
we get there, so wait just a bit.</font>

113
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:11,922
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Father hates me now.</font>

114
00:17:11,922 --> 00:17:13,721
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

115
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:18,922
<font color="yellow">I disobeyed him,
which is why this happened.</font>

116
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:24,321
<font color="yellow">So I'll bet that he hates me now.</font>

117
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:28,521
<font color="yellow">There's no way that's true.
He treasures you so much.</font>

118
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,821
<font color="yellow">So how could you say such things?</font>

119
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:39,021
<font color="yellow">I'll bet that he's having quite
a hard time right now, too.</font>

120
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:43,521
<font color="yellow">Since this has effected not only you,
but Young Master Poong Yeon, too.</font>

121
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:48,221
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

122
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:49,622
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

123
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:54,122
<font color="yellow">Did something happen
to my older brother?</font>

124
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:32,922
<font color="yellow">This won't do.
Let's just go back.</font>

125
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:37,321
<font color="yellow">Please, Monk! Let me
just see his face for a bit.</font>

126
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:40,122
<font color="yellow">We'll both be in trouble
if your father finds out!</font>

127
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:42,521
<font color="yellow">- We can't.
- But, if I don't see him today</font>

128
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:47,422
<font color="yellow">I don't know when else
I'd be able to see him again.</font>

129
00:18:56,622 --> 00:19:01,422
<font color="yellow">Then we'll just see him for a short bit,
and then come back out, okay?</font>

130
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:05,321
<font color="yellow">These talismans won't last much longer!</font>

131
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,721
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

132
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:11,422
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

133
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:09,922
<font color="yellow">Older Brother.
How did you end up like this?</font>

134
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:14,422
<font color="yellow">Please wake up, Older Brother!</font>

135
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:26,122
<font color="yellow">Older Brother! Are you regaining
consciousness? It's me, Yeon Hui!</font>

136
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:41,821
<font color="yellow">B-b-begone... begone, you foul creature!</font>

137
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:51,182
<font color="yellow">Older Brother! Are you regaining
consciousness? It's me, Yeon Hui!</font>

138
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:07,090
<font color="yellow">B-b-begone... begone, you foul creature!</font>

139
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,622
<font color="yellow">Older... brother.</font>

140
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:20,821
<font color="yellow">Please... please, please!
Please, go away!</font>

141
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,922
<font color="yellow">Please, leave me!</font>

142
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:38,221
<font color="yellow">I... I want to live!
I want to live!</font>

143
00:21:38,221 --> 00:21:43,821
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you, I want to live!</font>

144
00:21:43,821 --> 00:21:49,021
<font color="yellow">Let's take our leave, Yeon Hui.
Come on, let's go.</font>

145
00:21:56,622 --> 00:22:01,021
<font color="yellow">You insolent wench.
How dare you come here!</font>

146
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:02,321
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

147
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:09,422
<font color="yellow">Poong Yeon.
This is because of you!</font>

148
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:12,622
<font color="yellow">This is all because
of your damned curse!</font>

149
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,821
<font color="yellow">And the fact that Poong Yeon
became this way</font>

150
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:17,422
<font color="yellow">is due to you and your
damned curse!</font>

151
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:23,021
<font color="yellow">This is why I could never love you
as my own daughter, Yeon Hui!</font>

152
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:28,922
<font color="yellow">You never should have been born.</font>

153
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:33,122
<font color="yellow">You should never have
come into this world!</font>

154
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:46,021
<font color="yellow">I'll beg you on my knees, like this.
So please, disappear.</font>

155
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:54,422
<font color="yellow">Please go far, far away
from my Poong Yeon!</font>

156
00:22:57,321 --> 00:23:00,021
<font color="yellow">Please!</font>

157
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:37,021
<font color="yellow">Take Yeon Hui away.</font>

158
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:38,622
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

159
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:04,122
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Yeon Hui.
Come on.</font>

160
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:18,122
<font color="yellow">Monk. How can I get to Chungbing Temple?</font>

161
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:29,321
<font color="yellow">I'll go there.
I'll do whatever I'm told to do.</font>

162
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:37,821
<font color="yellow">So please, save my older brother.</font>

163
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:53,622
<font color="yellow">Sir, we cannot delay this any longer.</font>

164
00:24:55,321 --> 00:25:02,122
<font color="yellow">Sir. A person from the palace
has come to see you.</font>

165
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:15,521
<font color="yellow">You all go ahead and leave
for Chungbing Temple with Yeon Hui.</font>

166
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:18,721
<font color="yellow">I'll soon follow you all
with the Grimoire of Curses.</font>

167
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:20,622
<font color="yellow">- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</font>

168
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:33,021
<font color="yellow">What brings you all the way here?</font>

169
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:38,922
<font color="yellow">I came to apologize.
I underestimated you.</font>

170
00:25:38,922 --> 00:25:44,221
<font color="yellow">Who could I possibly blame?
It's all my fault.</font>

171
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:50,321
<font color="yellow">When you readily agreed
to kill the princess 17 years ago</font>

172
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:53,422
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have let myself
be fooled by you so easily.</font>

173
00:25:53,422 --> 00:25:58,122
<font color="yellow">You're Choi Hyun Seo, after all.</font>

174
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:00,422
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want to say?</font>

175
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:11,321
<font color="yellow">Where is the princess?
You didn't kill her.</font>

176
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:19,422
<font color="yellow">It may have been because you felt
sympathy or pity toward the child.</font>

177
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:22,122
<font color="yellow">I completely understand.</font>

178
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:29,321
<font color="yellow">However, you must tell me now:
where did you hide the princess?</font>

179
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:35,422
<font color="yellow">The princess... is dead.</font>

180
00:26:35,922 --> 00:26:39,122
<font color="yellow">You saw it with your own eyes,
did you not?</font>

181
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:42,021
<font color="yellow">You saw that she was burned to death.</font>

182
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:52,521
<font color="yellow">Ah. So is this your answer?</font>

183
00:26:53,622 --> 00:27:01,122
<font color="yellow">I fully understand.
Then, I'll be going.</font>

184
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:38,321
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

185
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:52,122
<font color="yellow">The exit is that way.</font>

186
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:08,422
<font color="yellow">Sir. If the princess
is actually still alive</font>

187
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:11,221
<font color="yellow">you will be guilty of blatantly
disobeying the Queen Dowager</font>

188
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:17,122
<font color="yellow">and taking the Crown Prince's life,
and will be tried for those crimes.</font>

189
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:19,922
<font color="yellow">And the person who her
curse has transferred over to</font>

190
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:24,321
<font color="yellow">will be ill for 14 days,
before dying.</font>

191
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:28,821
<font color="yellow">However, I'm sure that those
things won't happen... will they?</font>

192
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:36,821
<font color="yellow">Surely you didn't do such a thing,
as someone who treasures this country.</font>

193
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:39,521
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

194
00:28:57,622 --> 00:28:59,922
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

195
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,321
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that I'm closed?</font>

196
00:29:56,622 --> 00:30:05,622
<font color="yellow">Um... I heard that you
sell tickets to get to China.</font>

197
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:07,922
<font color="yellow">And that's... why I came to see you.</font>

198
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:17,422
<font color="yellow">You've come to the wrong place.
We don't have such luxuries in stock.</font>

199
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,422
<font color="yellow">I came here from Cheondong.</font>

200
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:29,721
<font color="yellow">I need two boat tickets
headed for China.</font>

201
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:31,021
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

202
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:40,821
<font color="yellow">Come to the booth in two hours.</font>

203
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,922
<font color="yellow">It's 200 nyang.</font>

204
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,922
<font color="yellow">Are you all packed?</font>

205
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:22,821
<font color="yellow">Joon... the more I think about it,
the more dangerous this seems.</font>

206
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:28,221
<font color="yellow">Let's forget about this idea.
If we're caught, you'll be in danger.</font>

207
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:42,922
<font color="yellow">Mother. I've given up on a
lot of things by living in this house.</font>

208
00:31:42,922 --> 00:31:47,721
<font color="yellow">I had to degrade myself
just to survive here.</font>

209
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:53,821
<font color="yellow">But... I'm not going to
live like that any longer.</font>

210
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:55,321
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

211
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:09,922
<font color="yellow">At the very least, let's live our lives
doing what we want to do, from now on.</font>

212
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, I said that I'd pay you! Come on!</font>

213
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,000
<font color="yellow">Come on! Just once!
Why not, huh?</font>

214
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,298
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- Come here.</font>

215
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:09,900
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

216
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:19,098
<font color="yellow">Oh. Wow. This country of
Joseon is so old-fashioned!</font>

217
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:23,500
<font color="yellow">Due to some stupid regulations, we
can't even wear flashy things like this!</font>

218
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,298
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?
How tacky.</font>

219
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:29,700
<font color="yellow">Honestly, a good-looking guy like me
should be allowed a ring like this.</font>

220
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,400
<font color="yellow">Right? Huh?</font>

221
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,200
<font color="yellow">Of course!
It really suits you, sir!</font>

222
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,400
<font color="yellow">Why not take this chance and buy one?</font>

223
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,700
<font color="yellow">It's hard to even find quality items
like these for sale these days!</font>

224
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,298
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Of course!</font>

225
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:49,098
<font color="yellow">This is an import from China, but
trade restrictions have gotten so rigid</font>

226
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:51,400
<font color="yellow">that finding such things
for purchase is quite difficult!</font>

227
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,400
<font color="yellow">Figures. These are just as
beautiful as the ladies here!</font>

228
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,200
<font color="yellow">There's no way that these
could be from cruddy old Joseon!</font>

229
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,400
<font color="yellow">All right, I'm in a good mood.
You all can pick one out, each.</font>

230
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,098
<font color="yellow">I'll buy one for each of you,
so pick one out!</font>

231
00:34:05,098 --> 00:34:06,598
<font color="yellow">- Really, sir?
- Yeah!</font>

232
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:09,900
<font color="yellow">- Wow!
- How magnanimous!</font>

233
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,300
<font color="yellow">- Young Master.
- What?</font>

234
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,400
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

235
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,500
<font color="yellow">Excuse me for a moment.</font>

236
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,400
<font color="yellow">Mommy!</font>

237
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, go all the way in.</font>

238
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,000
<font color="yellow">Wait here. I'll hurry and
get us the boat tickets.</font>

239
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:08,900
<font color="yellow">I've given up on a lot of
things by living in this house.</font>

240
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,400
<font color="yellow">I've degraded myself
just to survive here.</font>

241
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:19,400
<font color="yellow">I won't live like that any longer.</font>

242
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:40,599
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see Mr. Kapachi.</font>

243
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,300
<font color="yellow">Here's the amount you asked for.
Please hurry and give me tickets.</font>

244
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:07,791
<font color="yellow">I only sell tickets to a person once.
Do you know why that is?</font>

245
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:13,090
<font color="yellow">Because the people on the boat
either make it safely to China</font>

246
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,791
<font color="yellow">or they become fish food due
to their trip going not so well.</font>

247
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:19,190
<font color="yellow">Or it's because
they were captured.</font>

248
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,291
<font color="yellow">Do you know how most
people end up, though?</font>

249
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:25,791
<font color="yellow">They get captured.</font>

250
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:28,291
<font color="yellow">The type of people to pursue you
people are quite wicked and persistent.</font>

251
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,891
<font color="yellow">If you're caught, you die in
the worst way imaginable.</font>

252
00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:32,590
<font color="yellow">But if you're not, you're on
the run for the rest of your life.</font>

253
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:40,690
<font color="yellow">This is the last chance you'll have
to change your mind.</font>

254
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,391
<font color="yellow">You still want to go, though?</font>

255
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:51,291
<font color="yellow">I'll get on that boat,
no matter what happens.</font>

256
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:57,590
<font color="yellow">The boat will leave at 1:00 a.m.</font>

257
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,391
<font color="yellow">You must not even be a minute late.</font>

258
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,690
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

259
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:58,391
<font color="yellow">Are you going to Yeon Hui?</font>

260
00:38:58,391 --> 00:39:02,489
<font color="yellow">Wife. I have no time
to explain right now.</font>

261
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:04,590
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you everything
once I've returned.</font>

262
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,391
<font color="yellow">Please, don't go!</font>

263
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,489
<font color="yellow">It's all over now, anyway.</font>

264
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:20,190
<font color="yellow">I'm saying that everything is over now.</font>

265
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,690
<font color="yellow">What... do you mean by that?</font>

266
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,090
<font color="yellow"><i>What did you just say?</i></font>

267
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:49,391
<font color="yellow">I told the shamaness from
Sungsuchung everything!</font>

268
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:56,090
<font color="yellow">And why in the world did you do that?</font>

269
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:59,391
<font color="yellow">You really don't know?</font>

270
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:01,989
<font color="yellow">The strange mark that appeared
behind Poong Yeon's ear...</font>

271
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:04,391
<font color="yellow">that's because of Yeon Hui, isn't it?</font>

272
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:07,391
<font color="yellow">It's because Poong Yeon
developed feelings for Yeon Hui!</font>

273
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:11,391
<font color="yellow">We must break Yeon Hui's curse to save
the country from Hong Joo's black magic!</font>

274
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:12,590
<font color="yellow">I don't need any of that!</font>

275
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:17,190
<font color="yellow">Who cares about this damn country
when my son is laying there dying?</font>

276
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:26,891
<font color="yellow">That shamaness definitely said that if
only Yeon Hui dies... if only she dies...</font>

277
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,391
<font color="yellow">our Poong Yeon can live!</font>

278
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,291
<font color="yellow">She promised that she'd cover everything
up if you no longer interfered in this.</font>

279
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:48,891
<font color="yellow">So please, don't go.</font>

280
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:04,190
<font color="yellow">I've packed everything you'll need.
Let's hurry up and get going.</font>

281
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,590
<font color="yellow">Just stay here for a second.</font>

282
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:44,590
<font color="yellow">So the Imperial Taoist Branch
works together to hide the cursed child?</font>

283
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,791
<font color="yellow">You still call yourself
loyal subjects to the throne?</font>

284
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:50,190
<font color="yellow">Get them.</font>

285
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,190
<font color="yellow">Chun Kwon!
Chun Kwon!</font>

286
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:27,989
<font color="yellow">Chun Kwon! Chun Kwon!
Chun Kwon! Chun Kwon!</font>

287
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:30,291
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

288
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:49,090
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

289
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:03,090
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

290
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,090
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

291
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:44,489
<font color="yellow">Foolish bastards.
Do you know what her curse is?</font>

292
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:49,291
<font color="yellow">The fact that you're dying like this
is all because of her.</font>

293
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:59,690
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

294
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:12,791
<font color="yellow">What do you mean,
everything is because of me?</font>

295
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:32,791
<font color="yellow">Pitiful thing. Nobody told you
about your curse?</font>

296
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,590
<font color="yellow">All the people you love will die.</font>

297
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:43,791
<font color="yellow">And all the people who
love you will die, too.</font>

298
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:46,891
<font color="yellow">That's the curse upon you.</font>

299
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,391
<font color="yellow">Are you sad, my child?</font>

300
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,190
<font color="yellow">Are you miserable?</font>

301
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:19,090
<font color="yellow">So, why did you have to be born?
Nobody wanted you to be.</font>

302
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,791
<font color="yellow">Do you wish to save everyone?</font>

303
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:36,891
<font color="yellow">If you do, all you have
to do is die. Just you.</font>

304
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,391
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

305
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:11,690
<font color="yellow">Stop this.
You must not take this child away!</font>

306
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,090
<font color="yellow">Do not get in my way longer, sir.</font>

307
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,590
<font color="yellow">I cannot forgive you for meddling
further, even if it's you!</font>

308
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:32,190
<font color="yellow">Sir, please run away.</font>

309
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,190
<font color="yellow">Chase after him and the princess!
You mustn't lose them!</font>

310
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,891
<font color="yellow">You'll have to get through me, first!</font>

311
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:42,891
<font color="yellow">Who wants to be the first one to
join me on the path to the afterlife?</font>

312
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,291
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they couldn't have gotten far.
Search the area thoroughly!</font>

313
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:47,090
<font color="yellow">We must find them and
bring them to the palace!</font>

314
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,190
<font color="yellow">- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!</font>

315
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,891
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui.</font>

316
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,391
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

317
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:14,090
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui. Listen carefully to
what I'm about to tell you.</font>

318
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:25,391
<font color="yellow">If they catch sight of me,
you must run straight ahead!</font>

319
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:29,791
<font color="yellow">You must not look back, and
run straight ahead, all right?</font>

320
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:36,791
<font color="yellow">No. I don't want to!
This is all my fault.</font>

321
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:42,590
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die than let
more innocent people die!</font>

322
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:48,090
<font color="yellow">No. You mustn't, Yeon Hui!
You must live!</font>

323
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:51,489
<font color="yellow">You must go to Chungbing Temple
and break this curse!</font>

324
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,791
<font color="yellow">That's the only way that
we can all survive!</font>

325
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:58,291
<font color="yellow">You must go to Chungbing Temple.</font>

326
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:13,291
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Yeon Hui. And I know
this is late, but happy birthday.</font>

327
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:15,791
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

328
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:28,291
<font color="yellow">He's over there!
Chase after him!</font>

329
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:32,190
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeon Hui. You must not die.
You must live!</i></font>

330
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:36,391
<font color="yellow"><i>You must go to Chungbing Temple
and break this curse!</i></font>

331
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:38,690
<font color="yellow"><i>That's the only way that
we can all survive!</i></font>

332
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:50,891
<font color="yellow">Over there!</font>

333
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:03,190
<font color="yellow">Where is the princess?</font>

334
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,391
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

335
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:12,489
<font color="yellow">She's fated to die, anyway.</font>

336
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:16,391
<font color="yellow">So how could you throw away everything
for such a child?</font>

337
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:38,590
<font color="yellow">No... that child must live.
That's the will of the heavens.</font>

338
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:48,690
<font color="yellow">The will of the heavens?
What is that, exactly?</font>

339
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:53,190
<font color="yellow">Yielding to a fate that
was so unjust previously?</font>

340
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,791
<font color="yellow">Is that the "will of the heavens"
that you speak of?</font>

341
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:07,391
<font color="yellow">Being born with nothing to my name, and
being a target for those who were rich?</font>

342
00:53:07,391 --> 00:53:14,391
<font color="yellow">Having to bow before people even
if they trampled on me or laughed at me?</font>

343
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:18,791
<font color="yellow">Is that the damned "will of the heavens"
that you speak of?</font>

344
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:23,391
<font color="yellow">Those who worship the heavens
have a duty!</font>

345
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:32,090
<font color="yellow">Paving the path for the will of the
heavens to be carried out is our duty.</font>

346
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:37,190
<font color="yellow">No. I won't live like that any longer.</font>

347
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:42,291
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be the one to trample
on them, and rise to the top.</font>

348
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:51,989
<font color="yellow">Hong Joo. I know very well
how you must feel.</font>

349
00:53:51,989 --> 00:53:55,690
<font color="yellow">However, you're going
about this the wrong way.</font>

350
00:53:56,391 --> 00:54:02,489
<font color="yellow">That fact that things came
to this today is all my fault.</font>

351
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:12,489
<font color="yellow">Let's go back to the palace together.
Let's stop here, and atone for our sins.</font>

352
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:16,489
<font color="yellow">Don't fall any further into ruin,
Hong Joo!</font>

353
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:53,190
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that this is how I'm paying
you back for what you've taught me.</font>

354
00:54:54,090 --> 00:55:02,291
<font color="yellow">However... I don't believe in
the heavens, starting today.</font>

355
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:10,590
<font color="yellow">From now on, my will is going
to be the will of the heavens.</font>

356
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:26,190
<font color="yellow">We must capture the princess,
at all costs!</font>

357
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:31,391
<font color="yellow">We must capture her, and kill her!</font>

358
