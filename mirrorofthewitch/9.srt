<font color="yellow">So everything in
the Grimoire of Curses</font>

9
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:52,041
<font color="yellow">was about her?</font>

10
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,135
<font color="yellow">That's why Seo Ri needs you.</font>

11
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,577
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you have
the Ok Choo Kyung symbol</font>

12
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:03,044

<font color="yellow">So he works as a boundary,
but he's a human boundary...</font>

16

<font color="yellow">Ok Choo Kyung.</font>

17
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,514
<font color="yellow">Ok Choo Kyung.</font>

18
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,699
<font color="yellow">How messy.</font>

19
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,127
<font color="yellow">It's all been ruined.</font>

20
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:14,024
<font color="yellow">So over here... In here...</font>

21
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,586
<font color="yellow">At this rate,
you might even untie my robe.</font>

22
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,534
<font color="yellow">It's just...</font>

23
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,608
<font color="yellow">This is something very precious.</font>

24
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,615
<font color="yellow">So we must take good care of it.</font>

25
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:42,079
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

26
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,409
<font color="yellow">By the way, why were you
locked up in jail?</font>

27
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,916
<font color="yellow">Lady Yeon Hui's brother...</font>

28
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:59,724
<font color="yellow">By the way, does her family
not know that she's here?</font>

29
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:02,438
<font color="yellow">They would be better off not knowing...</font>

30
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:07,212
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.
Why are you changing the topic?</font>

31
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,610
<font color="yellow">Have you committed
a grave crime by chance?</font>

32
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,497
<font color="yellow">What if the police are
chasing after us right now?</font>

33
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,322
<font color="yellow">I've been framed.</font>

34
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:18,849
<font color="yellow">That freaking Red Gentleman's Robe
or Blue Gentleman's Robe.</font>

35
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,377
<font color="yellow">I feel bad enough about
being accused of murder.</font>

36
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:24,914
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

37
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:27,238
<font color="yellow">The Red Gentleman's Robe?</font>

38
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:31,305
<font color="yellow">- What? Why?
- Do you know him by chance?</font>

39
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:33,099
<font color="yellow">Or have you seen him?</font>

40
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:38,745
<font color="yellow">If I knew him, I would have captured him.
What's going on?</font>

41
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,416
<font color="yellow">The people he has killed</font>

42
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,774
<font color="yellow">all made wishes to Seo Ri.</font>

43
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,226
<font color="yellow">Because of the Red Gentleman's Robe</font>

44
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:54,055
<font color="yellow">Seo Ri hasn't been able
to break the curse.</font>

45
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,529
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

46
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:02,916
<font color="yellow">Seo Ri doesn't know about this,
so you can't ever tell her.</font>

47
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,666
<font color="yellow">You're awake.</font>

48
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:17,106
<font color="yellow">Why is he here?</font>

49
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:25,224
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you a question.</font>

50
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:27,464
<font color="yellow">Why is he here?</font>

51
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,661
<font color="yellow">You see...</font>

52
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:35,875
<font color="yellow">Seo Ri, hold on. Seo Ri.
Wait. Seo Ri.</font>

53
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,212
<font color="yellow">- Do you think that makes any sense?
- I don't like this situation either.</font>

54
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:40,805
<font color="yellow">But what can we do?</font>

55
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,822
<font color="yellow">Look how unharmed we are even
after the boundary broke down.</font>

56
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:46,981
<font color="yellow">So Lord Heo is our human boundary
who can protect us...</font>

57
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,200
<font color="yellow">There is no such a thing.</font>

58
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:53,303
<font color="yellow">The boundary is fine.</font>

59
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:55,493
<font color="yellow">When you went outside,
the boundary was breaking down.</font>

60
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:59,329
<font color="yellow">But it was restored
because Lord Heo came back.</font>

61
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:03,099
<font color="yellow">He's serving as our boundary
right now as well.</font>

62
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,784
<font color="yellow">Last night.</font>

63
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:15,158
<font color="yellow">Were you the one who saved me?</font>

64
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:20,185
<font color="yellow">I mean, according to Monk Yoh Gwang</font>

65
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:23,286
<font color="yellow">Apparently I did.</font>

66
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:28,646
<font color="yellow">Did you see everything?</font>

67
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,626
<font color="yellow">I don't need him.</font>

68
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,748
<font color="yellow">Send him out.</font>

69
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:43,645
<font color="yellow">Seo Ri. Seo Ri!</font>

70
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:49,724
<font color="yellow">You can't go anywhere.
Just stay right here.</font>

71
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:51,224
<font color="yellow">Seo Ri!</font>

72
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:59,507
<font color="yellow">Is it because you're embarrassed
that he saw you like that?</font>

73
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:01,517
<font color="yellow">It's actually better this way.</font>

74
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:04,537
<font color="yellow">He knows everything inside
the Grimoire of Curses.</font>

75
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,786
<font color="yellow">Bring me the wish plaques.</font>

76
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:09,579
<font color="yellow">Seo Ri. That's not what's important--</font>

77
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,388
<font color="yellow">We need to light the candles
as soon as we can.</font>

78
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:15,738
<font color="yellow">Father told me everyone will live</font>

79
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:18,802
<font color="yellow">once I break the curse.</font>

80
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:20,693
<font color="yellow">We don't even know
how my brother is doing.</font>

81
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,241
<font color="yellow">So I'm saying let's stay with that man
until we finish lighting all the candles.</font>

82
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,450
<font color="yellow">He is our only option right now.</font>

83
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,855
<font color="yellow">Seo Ri.</font>

84
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:41,234
<font color="yellow">Why are you awake already?
Why don't you lie down a little longer?</font>

85
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:43,724
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

86
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:45,747
<font color="yellow">I think I was just tired.</font>

87
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:48,677
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, I feel much better
after getting some sleep.</font>

88
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:52,248
<font color="yellow">You should take it easy.</font>

89
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:55,864
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

90
00:09:57,021 --> 00:10:00,797
<font color="yellow">I thought your body may be weakened,
so I've gotten you some medicine.</font>

91
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,546
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

92
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:16,219
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.</font>

93
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:20,017
<font color="yellow">By chance...</font>

94
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:23,228
<font color="yellow">Have you found Yeon Hui?</font>

95
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:29,656
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

96
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:31,930
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

97
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,422
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.
She's just been in my thoughts lately.</font>

98
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:56,036
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

99
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,728
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

100
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:02,762
<font color="yellow">I had the same symptoms
the day Yeon Hui disappeared.</font>

101
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,151
<font color="yellow">I wonder if something has
happened to Yeon Hui.</font>

102
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:14,993
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
How could the criminal have escaped?</font>

103
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:19,358
<font color="yellow">While I was using the bathroom,
he disappeared completely.</font>

104
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:25,800
<font color="yellow">Someone unlocked the door for him.</font>

105
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,926
<font color="yellow">That means someone from
the inside helped him.</font>

106
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:30,036
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

107
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:33,897
<font color="yellow">If he has an insider's help,
he may have also escaped the inspection.</font>

108
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,222
<font color="yellow">Couldn't he already have
escaped from the capital?</font>

109
00:11:36,222 --> 00:11:37,604
<font color="yellow"><i>Who are you?</i></font>

110
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:39,924
<font color="yellow">How are you related to
the Red Gentleman's Robe?</font>

111
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:41,786
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

112
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,561
<font color="yellow">I'm a man who wants to capture
the Red Gentleman's Robe very badly.</font>

113
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:48,190
<font color="yellow">No. He is still in the capital.</font>

114
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,816
<font color="yellow">I need to go see the 100-year-old tree.</font>

115
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:15,775
<font color="yellow">I don't get what this whole
boundary thing is</font>

116
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:19,696
<font color="yellow">but bad things won't happen to you
if I stay by your side, right?</font>

117
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,592
<font color="yellow">I don't believe that.</font>

118
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:26,660
<font color="yellow">So don't worry about it and just leave.</font>

119
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,357
<font color="yellow">You only stayed in that house
in the Black Forest before.</font>

120
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:33,200
<font color="yellow">And it seems like now
you can't leave this place either.</font>

121
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,545
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it feel suffocating?</font>

122
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,383
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business.</font>

123
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:39,758
<font color="yellow">I'm saying if there is some place
you would like to go to</font>

124
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,243
<font color="yellow">I will go there with you,
wherever that may be.</font>

125
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:49,848
<font color="yellow">All you need is for me
to stay by your side.</font>

126
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:54,190
<font color="yellow">If there are some persimmons,
you could pick them yourself too.</font>

127
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:05,117
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep pretending
like you don't know me?</font>

128
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:11,185
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see that
I'm not the same person I was?</font>

129
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:14,430
<font color="yellow">You would be better off
not getting involved with me.</font>

130
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,360
<font color="yellow">Then you should have actually
given me the oblivion elixir.</font>

131
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:36,791
<font color="yellow">So it seems like you make people
an elixir based on</font>

132
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,477
<font color="yellow">the Grimoire of Curses
whenever someone makes a wish.</font>

133
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:43,503
<font color="yellow">And that seems to help you too.</font>

134
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:44,974
<font color="yellow">I told you to mind your own business.</font>

135
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:49,007
<font color="yellow">I've already found out about all this,
and I remember everything.</font>

136
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:50,147
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

137
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,166
<font color="yellow">would like to help you.</font>

138
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:51,435
<font color="yellow"><i>Your Highness.</i></font>

139
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:54,748
<font color="yellow">There is an unfortunate rumor
amongst the public that</font>

140
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:58,388
<font color="yellow">the Red Gentleman's Robe is still alive.</font>

141
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:01,194
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

142
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:04,998
<font color="yellow">Didn't we even confirm
the Red Gentleman's Robe's corpse?</font>

143
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:09,700
<font color="yellow">Multiple people have reported
seeing the Red Gentleman's Robe.</font>

144
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,729
<font color="yellow">So are you saying I captured
a falsely accused man?</font>

145
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:16,355
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

146
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:19,174
<font color="yellow">- That's not it...
- Then what is it?</font>

147
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:27,994
<font color="yellow">Find the source of this preposterous
rumor and bring them to me.</font>

148
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,824
<font color="yellow">In front of everyone</font>

149
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:34,743
<font color="yellow">I'm going to rip that man's tongue out
and set an example.</font>

150
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:38,424
<font color="yellow">Your Highness,
Queen Dowager has arrived.</font>

151
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,252
<font color="yellow">Tell her to return to her place.</font>

152
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:51,174
<font color="yellow">You can't let emotions interfere
with the way you govern.</font>

153
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:53,932
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

154
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:57,831
<font color="yellow">You need to be considerate of
your people's anxiety.</font>

155
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:00,746
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

156
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:03,653
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

157
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:06,729
<font color="yellow">this is a place to discuss
the matters of state affairs.</font>

158
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:09,800
<font color="yellow">Not a get-together for
the Royal Noble Consort.</font>

159
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,143
<font color="yellow">I think you've lost your judgment.</font>

160
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:18,494
<font color="yellow">How could you govern with clarity?</font>

161
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,518
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

162
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,080
<font color="yellow">If you lose your way</font>

163
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,528
<font color="yellow">this entire nation will crumble.</font>

164
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:35,648
<font color="yellow">If your mind is
too troubled to govern...</font>

165
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:39,064
<font color="yellow">even I may have to take charge.</font>

166
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:43,961
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

167
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,823
<font color="yellow">So are you telling me right now to</font>

168
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:49,387
<font color="yellow">give up my throne?</font>

169
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,826
<font color="yellow">I'm saying if need be</font>

170
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:55,969
<font color="yellow">I'll take over and govern in your place.</font>

171
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:59,314
<font color="yellow">Your Highness.</font>

172
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:02,254
<font color="yellow">His Majesty is so healthy and well.</font>

173
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,407
<font color="yellow">We can't have a Queen Regent.</font>

174
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:08,250
<font color="yellow">- What if he isn't very healthy?
- Grand Eunuch!</font>

175
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:15,167
<font color="yellow">I think Queen Dowager's
eyes are failing her.</font>

176
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,128
<font color="yellow">Escort her back to her place.</font>

177
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,822
<font color="yellow">Eunuch Park. Bring him in.</font>

178
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,244
<font color="yellow">You're not even the royal physician.</font>

179
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:42,148
<font color="yellow">But I heard you've been treating
His Majesty every night.</font>

180
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:46,594
<font color="yellow">- Is this true?
- Yes. It is.</font>

181
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,920
<font color="yellow">What is His Majesty's
health like right now?</font>

182
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,717
<font color="yellow">From an unknown skin disorder</font>

183
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:56,005
<font color="yellow">he keeps getting scratches.</font>

184
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:59,632
<font color="yellow">Thus, he is in grave condition.</font>

185
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:01,165
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

186
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:05,971
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

187
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:09,179
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by
His Majesty's illness?</font>

188
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,199
<font color="yellow">I understand your considerate
decision to conceal your illness from</font>

189
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:16,386
<font color="yellow">the public and your officials
in order to keep them from worrying.</font>

190
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,093
<font color="yellow">However, your well-being is
directly related to</font>

191
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:22,913
<font color="yellow">the prosperity of this country.</font>

192
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:26,980
<font color="yellow">This isn't something
you can just brush under the rug.</font>

193
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:30,314
<font color="yellow">It's a lie.</font>

194
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:34,003
<font color="yellow">Queen Dowager is setting me up!</font>

195
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:47,969
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Your illness is so serious.</font>

196
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:52,851
<font color="yellow">You need to take care of
your health, Your Highness.</font>

197
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:01,257
<font color="yellow">Set your worries aside and
allow me to take over in your place.</font>

198
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,912
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you could heal me?</font>

199
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:55,306
<font color="yellow">Don't be inpatient. This will take time.</font>

200
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:58,238
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure
you feel comfortable soon.</font>

201
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:06,373
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

202
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,438
<font color="yellow">am a king barely
holding onto his throne.</font>

203
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:16,856
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that</font>

204
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:20,353
<font color="yellow">they've unwillingly placed me,
a collateral descendant</font>

205
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,558
<font color="yellow">on the throne and
are making a mockery of me?</font>

206
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:26,967
<font color="yellow">Everyone is trying to get me killed.</font>

207
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,373
<font color="yellow">So.</font>

208
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:31,813
<font color="yellow">You need to hurry and heal me.</font>

209
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,882
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

210
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,378
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Your Highness.</font>

211
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:40,738
<font color="yellow">You can take care of everything
once you've recovered.</font>

212
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:44,307
<font color="yellow">I'll eliminate those who
stand in your way for you.</font>

213
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:53,017
<font color="yellow">You would do that for me?</font>

214
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:57,697
<font color="yellow">I've given you Sungsuchung
because you've wanted it.</font>

215
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,434
<font color="yellow">Is that all you want?</font>

216
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,864
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

217
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:08,253
<font color="yellow">I've returned to the palace to eliminate
this country's source of trouble.</font>

218
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:10,558
<font color="yellow">So I must accomplish this.</font>

219
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:16,265
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you for your true motives.</font>

220
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:17,573
<font color="yellow">In addition</font>

221
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:21,142
<font color="yellow">I'd like to help dwindle the power of
Queen Dowager, who had expelled me.</font>

222
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:23,600
<font color="yellow">And as a mere shamaness</font>

223
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,955
<font color="yellow">I would like to be
your loyal subject, Your Highness.</font>

224
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:36,694
<font color="yellow">Raw yam, acorus gramineus,
and berberidaceae.</font>

225
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:38,478
<font color="yellow">These are used to make
a ghost-seeing elixir.</font>

226
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:41,524
<font color="yellow">What are you making this for?</font>

227
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:43,296
<font color="yellow">Move aside.</font>

228
00:21:49,197 --> 00:21:51,848
<font color="yellow">Are there people who wish to see ghosts?</font>

229
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:56,244
<font color="yellow">There is nothing for
you to help me with.</font>

230
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:59,691
<font color="yellow">The sooner I reach our goal,
the sooner Yoh Gwang will let you go.</font>

231
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:03,077
<font color="yellow">If you would really like to help,
just don't get in my way.</font>

232
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:10,697
<font color="yellow">It seems like no one has made any wishes.
Why are you in such a hurry?</font>

233
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:54,778
<font color="yellow">Why are you...</font>

234
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:58,908
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking that?</font>

235
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:10,115
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

236
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:12,825
<font color="yellow">Where are you going
after drinking that elixir?</font>

237
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:18,169
<font color="yellow">Since I've drank the ghost-seeing elixir,
I need to go see some dead people.</font>

238
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:21,556
<font color="yellow">- Huh?
- I need to capture someone.</font>

239
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:23,449
<font color="yellow">If I ask the dead people</font>

240
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:27,609
<font color="yellow">I may be able to find out
who he is and where he is.</font>

241
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:30,922
<font color="yellow">So I need you to come with me.</font>

242
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:35,651
<font color="yellow">You look pretty.</font>

243
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:40,075
<font color="yellow">Yoh Gwang said we need to stay together.</font>

244
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:42,087
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

245
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,492
<font color="yellow">You want me to go by myself?
And abandon you here?</font>

246
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:50,988
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. So just leave.</font>

247
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:52,507
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

248
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:57,500
<font color="yellow">Yoh Gwang made it sound like something
horrible will happen if I leave.</font>

249
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:07,017
<font color="yellow">Is it because you're nervous?</font>

250
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:09,484
<font color="yellow">Nervous that I might not
be your boundary?</font>

251
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:20,659
<font color="yellow">That gives us more of
a reason to step outside.</font>

252
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,343
<font color="yellow">We'll know once we step outside.
Whether I'm your boundary or not.</font>

253
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:33,721
<font color="yellow">I saw a ghost! You freaking bastards.</font>

254
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:38,517
<font color="yellow">Where's the guy you've
passed the palanquin on to?</font>

255
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:41,776
<font color="yellow">- We don't know who he is.
- You don't?</font>

256
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:45,831
<font color="yellow">So you just gave it to
a man you didn't know?</font>

257
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,427
<font color="yellow">The palanquin I was in?</font>

258
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:51,923
<font color="yellow">If you endanger the royal police,
who's going to protect the royal family?</font>

259
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,407
<font color="yellow">This is treason!</font>

260
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:58,671
<font color="yellow">I'm going to ask you for the last time.
Where is that bastard?</font>

261
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:03,604
<font color="yellow">We really don't know who he is.
We just did it for the money.</font>

262
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:07,884
<font color="yellow">So you don't know?
I just can't use nice words with you.</font>

263
00:25:07,884 --> 00:25:11,970
<font color="yellow">You'll talk once I cut some
parts off your body, right?</font>

264
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,642
<font color="yellow">Which part would you like me to cut off?
Hm? Take your pick.</font>

265
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:16,180
<font color="yellow">Grab them.</font>

266
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,805
<font color="yellow">We really don't know who he is!
Soon Deuk!</font>

267
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:21,867
<font color="yellow">It was a job offered by Soon Deuk.</font>

268
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,556
<font color="yellow">- Soon Deuk?
- Yes.</font>

269
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:26,562
<font color="yellow">She's that girl who shows up
at the gambling den sometimes.</font>

270
00:25:26,562 --> 00:25:28,456
<font color="yellow">She offered us the job.</font>

271
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,274
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

272
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,245
<font color="yellow">Hey. Ma Soon Deuk.</font>

273
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:41,159
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

274
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:44,988
<font color="yellow">Let go! Let me go!</font>

275
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:46,401
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

276
00:25:49,192 --> 00:25:50,840
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

277
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:56,914
<font color="yellow">What are you doing
to a woman right now? Huh?</font>

278
00:25:56,914 --> 00:25:58,476
<font color="yellow">Politely.</font>

279
00:25:58,476 --> 00:25:59,751
<font color="yellow">Soon Deuk.</font>

280
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:04,823
<font color="yellow">Where's Heo Joon? Hm?</font>

281
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:08,363
<font color="yellow">- I don't know.
- I think you do.</font>

282
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:11,565
<font color="yellow">I need to capture Heo Joon
no matter what.</font>

283
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:13,988
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill him
once I capture him.</font>

284
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:17,500
<font color="yellow">If you won't tell me where he is,
I'll kill you too.</font>

285
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,351
<font color="yellow">Tell me where he is.</font>

286
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:20,922
<font color="yellow">Where is he? Tell me.</font>

287
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:24,438
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you what I don't know.</font>

288
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:28,346
<font color="yellow">He went his way.
I haven't seen him since that day.</font>

289
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,912
<font color="yellow">You guys are trying to screw me over.</font>

290
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:42,807
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

291
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:46,009
<font color="yellow">So Heo Joon</font>

292
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:49,592
<font color="yellow">went into hiding after threatening me.</font>

293
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:52,734
<font color="yellow">So if he's in hiding</font>

294
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,669
<font color="yellow">then I'll just have to
make him reveal himself.</font>

295
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:06,660
<font color="yellow">Hey. This is pretty. Take a look.</font>

296
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:23,620
<font color="yellow">Keep your head up and
keep your eyes on the road.</font>

297
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,529
<font color="yellow">People are staring at you more because
you're excessively covering yourself.</font>

298
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:28,237
<font color="yellow">They're wondering how
hideous you must be.</font>

299
00:27:29,692 --> 00:27:33,914
<font color="yellow">It's just because
there are too many people.</font>

300
00:27:37,938 --> 00:27:39,879
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

301
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,363
<font color="yellow">See? You're fine.</font>

302
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:08,673
<font color="yellow">No one is looking at you weirdly.</font>

303
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:10,748
<font color="yellow">To those people</font>

304
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:14,131
<font color="yellow">you're just one of the many others
passing by this street.</font>

305
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:16,296
<font color="yellow">Not so different from those people.</font>

306
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,460
<font color="yellow">Just a very ordinary person.</font>

307
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,515
<font color="yellow">They might stare at you
because you're quite pretty</font>

308
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:49,504
<font color="yellow">but that's you're fault for being pretty.
So you deal with it.</font>

309
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:53,865
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me
and you worry about yourself.</font>

310
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:57,328
<font color="yellow">She's being shy.</font>

311
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:10,476
<font color="yellow">Has he lost it?
What's wrong with him?</font>

312
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,937
<font color="yellow">Stop it! Stop it!</font>

313
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:24,955
<font color="yellow">I don't know who's supposed
to be whose boundary.</font>

314
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,571
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

315
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:33,536
<font color="yellow">Who's the dead person you wanted to see?</font>

316
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:37,331
<font color="yellow">A friend of mine.
The person who was killed because of me.</font>

317
00:29:57,488 --> 00:30:00,180
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard for us to
find any evidence.</font>

318
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,748
<font color="yellow">Search this area thoroughly and see
if there are any odd objects or signs.</font>

319
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:09,404
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

320
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:13,784
<font color="yellow">Are we trying to capture
the Red Gentleman's Robe?</font>

321
00:30:13,784 --> 00:30:15,848
<font color="yellow">Or Heo Joon?</font>

322
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,222
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

323
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:19,344
<font color="yellow">If we capture Heo Joon</font>

324
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:21,465
<font color="yellow">we may get a lead on
the Red Gentleman's Robe.</font>

325
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:25,314
<font color="yellow">If we capture the Red Gentleman's Robe,
Heo Joon will appear at the scene.</font>

326
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:30,140
<font color="yellow">What's this place for?</font>

327
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,663
<font color="yellow">A gisaeng house.</font>

328
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:39,534
<font color="yellow">A gisaeng house?</font>

329
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:43,552
<font color="yellow">- Was your friend a gisaeng?
- Yeah.</font>

330
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:48,337
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.</font>

331
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:52,911
<font color="yellow">Why is it so quiet?</font>

332
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:55,025
<font color="yellow">Gisaeng houses are always
quiet during the day.</font>

333
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:57,615
<font color="yellow">This is when everyone sleeps.</font>

334
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:59,875
<font color="yellow">How are you so knowledgeable
in this area?</font>

335
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,451
<font color="yellow">This is like my home.</font>

336
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,746
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

337
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:34,841
<font color="yellow">Stay here for a while.</font>

338
00:32:16,113 --> 00:32:17,710
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

339
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,095
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

340
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:01,168
<font color="yellow">Why would you fall down from there?</font>

341
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,904
<font color="yellow">Get it together.</font>

342
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,047
<font color="yellow">She's not here. Let's go.</font>

343
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:19,375
<font color="yellow">How will we find any clues this way?</font>

344
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:37,180
<font color="yellow">Do you know Man Weol by chance...</font>

345
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:48,084
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Man Weol?</font>

346
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:54,054
<font color="yellow">All right. I understand.</font>

347
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:59,173
<font color="yellow">Anyways. Stay well.</font>

348
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,216
<font color="yellow">What did she say?</font>

349
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:15,105
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

350
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,292
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui. Should we...</font>

351
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:37,625
<font color="yellow">I'm so sick and tired of it.</font>

352
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:40,614
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui, come.</font>

353
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:43,837
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- To where?</font>

354
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:45,701
<font color="yellow">The place where Man Weol died.</font>

355
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:52,529
<font color="yellow">She may be by the place she died,
not where she was living in.</font>

356
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:15,643
<font color="yellow">Is she here?</font>

357
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,745
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

358
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:30,649
<font color="yellow">Thankfully, she must have
went to a better place.</font>

359
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,663
<font color="yellow">Man Weol.</font>

360
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:06,616
<font color="yellow">Who has made you like this?</font>

361
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,515
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

362
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:54,843
<font color="yellow">Sol Gae. Let's go back.</font>

363
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,033
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

364
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:00,020
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we stake out
or something?</font>

365
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,283
<font color="yellow">We don't know when he'll show up.</font>

366
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:06,786
<font color="yellow">We can't even mobilize any forces
since it's a closed case.</font>

367
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:09,801
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be really difficult to
capture the Red Gentleman's Robe.</font>

368
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:17,754
<font color="yellow">You said the people who were killed
hung their wish plaques here, right?</font>

369
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,730
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

370
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:26,649
<font color="yellow">What happened to your friend?</font>

371
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:33,779
<font color="yellow">I heard she got killed while she was
waiting for me at that watermill.</font>

372
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,785
<font color="yellow">By that crazy murderer.</font>

373
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:47,071
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you asking me
about what kind of person I am</font>

374
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:48,902
<font color="yellow">and what my plans are?</font>

375
00:38:48,902 --> 00:38:51,031
<font color="yellow">You must be curious.</font>

376
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:55,185
<font color="yellow">You didn't ask me any questions either.</font>

377
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:04,464
<font color="yellow">Weren't you scared of how I looked?</font>

378
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,997
<font color="yellow">I was a little surprised...</font>

379
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:28,832
<font color="yellow">and my heart ached for you.</font>

380
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:43,652
<font color="yellow">Where will this road take us?</font>

381
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:46,547
<font color="yellow">I don't think this will
take us to Chungbing Temple.</font>

382
00:39:46,547 --> 00:39:49,962
<font color="yellow">There is this place I wanted to see
before we go back.</font>

383
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,526
<font color="yellow">So this is the 100-year-old tree, huh?</font>

384
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:18,553
<font color="yellow"><i>[I wish to see my missed one again.]</i></font>

385
00:40:20,605 --> 00:40:24,462
<font color="yellow"><i>[A Killing Tree]</i></font>

386
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:35,462
<font color="yellow">Let's get back.
Monk Yoh Gwang must be very worried.</font>

387
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:39,797
<font color="yellow">What is all of this stuff?</font>

388
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:44,908
<font color="yellow">What do they mean by "A Killing Tree"?</font>

389
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:59,176
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?
How could you leave this place?</font>

390
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:03,156
<font color="yellow">I've asked you to stay by her side!
Not go outside with her!</font>

391
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:06,435
<font color="yellow">I've told you our lives are on the line
and begged you for help!</font>

392
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,238
<font color="yellow">Did it all sound like a joke to you?</font>

393
00:41:09,346 --> 00:41:11,165
<font color="yellow">The 100-year-old tree.</font>

394
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:14,803
<font color="yellow">What has happened to it?</font>

395
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:23,303
<font color="yellow">People are calling it "A Killing Tree."</font>

396
00:41:23,303 --> 00:41:27,419
<font color="yellow">Did the people who
hung their wish plaques...</font>

397
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:29,281
<font color="yellow">die?</font>

398
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:36,765
<font color="yellow">My candles was blown out 12 times.</font>

399
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:41,495
<font color="yellow">Those people...</font>

400
00:41:41,495 --> 00:41:43,850
<font color="yellow">Are they all dead?</font>

401
00:41:47,754 --> 00:41:50,225
<font color="yellow">Was it that shamaness's doing?</font>

402
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:55,573
<font color="yellow">I think she found out
about your candles.</font>

403
00:41:56,435 --> 00:42:01,062
<font color="yellow">She's been sending assassins to
whomever hangs their wish plaque</font>

404
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:03,131
<font color="yellow">on the 100-year-old tree.</font>

405
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:07,654
<font color="yellow">So all those people have died</font>

406
00:42:07,654 --> 00:42:10,194
<font color="yellow">because of me too.</font>

407
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:14,551
<font color="yellow">Because of my curse.</font>

408
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:17,808
<font color="yellow">That's not it, Seo Ri.</font>

409
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:20,946
<font color="yellow">Why is that woman doing this to me?</font>

410
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:23,500
<font color="yellow">Hm? With what purpose?</font>

411
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:27,765
<font color="yellow">I stayed in the Black Forest
because I was told to.</font>

412
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:31,430
<font color="yellow">I've been lighting candles because
I was told I have to break the curse.</font>

413
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:34,163
<font color="yellow">Because I was cursed...</font>

414
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,977
<font color="yellow">I thought that was why
the shamaness</font>

415
00:42:36,977 --> 00:42:38,515
<font color="yellow">has been trying to kill me.</font>

416
00:42:40,205 --> 00:42:43,852
<font color="yellow">So I thought all I had to do was
break the curse.</font>

417
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:47,886
<font color="yellow">People have died because
I've been trying to break the curse!</font>

418
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:51,067
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard I try...</font>

419
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:56,221
<font color="yellow">can I never break free of this curse?</font>

420
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:10,120
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

421
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,254
<font color="yellow">I vaguely understand what you're saying,
but it's not your fault.</font>

422
00:43:16,504 --> 00:43:19,084
<font color="yellow">Your friend.</font>

423
00:43:20,689 --> 00:43:23,256
<font color="yellow">Was she killed because of me?</font>

424
00:43:24,946 --> 00:43:27,667
<font color="yellow">Why would it be your fault?</font>

425
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:30,623
<font color="yellow">I've told you.
It's the Red Gentleman's Robe's doing.</font>

426
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:35,553
<font color="yellow">Let go of me, sir.</font>

427
00:43:42,254 --> 00:43:44,256
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

428
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:47,344
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

429
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:25,799
<font color="yellow">Queen Dowager wants to speak to you.</font>

430
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:33,096
<font color="yellow">How's His Majesty doing?</font>

431
00:44:33,096 --> 00:44:35,922
<font color="yellow">What are you worried about?</font>

432
00:44:35,922 --> 00:44:38,243
<font color="yellow">About his quick and sudden recovery?</font>

433
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:40,564
<font color="yellow">Or about His Majesty passing away?</font>

434
00:44:42,171 --> 00:44:44,303
<font color="yellow">I should be worried.</font>

435
00:44:44,303 --> 00:44:47,013
<font color="yellow">He has the body
my crown prince will receive.</font>

436
00:44:48,306 --> 00:44:50,187
<font color="yellow">I'll pass the body on to Prince Soonhwe</font>

437
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,069
<font color="yellow">once His Majesty is healthy and strong.</font>

438
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:55,321
<font color="yellow">So set your worries aside.</font>

439
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:57,971
<font color="yellow">I heard you're in charge of
the state of affairs.</font>

440
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:04,127
<font color="yellow">I must protect the throne
my prince will inherit.</font>

441
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:13,982
<font color="yellow">Hold a ceremony to wish for
the well-being of His Majesty.</font>

442
00:45:13,982 --> 00:45:18,183
<font color="yellow">Even the general public must have heard
about His Majesty's illness.</font>

443
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:21,756
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we pray for
a full recovery of his health?</font>

444
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:24,837
<font color="yellow">I will follow your orders,
Your Highness.</font>

445
00:45:24,837 --> 00:45:28,183
<font color="yellow">Attend tomorrow morning's meeting,
and bring this subject up.</font>

446
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,500
<font color="yellow"><i>[I wish to see my missed one again.]</i></font>

447
00:47:03,325 --> 00:47:06,129
<font color="yellow">Because of me...</font>

448
00:47:06,129 --> 00:47:08,346
<font color="yellow">my mother passed away too.</font>

449
00:47:10,785 --> 00:47:13,361
<font color="yellow">Because of me...</font>

450
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:16,799
<font color="yellow">my friend died.</font>

451
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,129
<font color="yellow">Because I kept on blaming myself...</font>

452
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:28,055
<font color="yellow">I couldn't do anything with my life.</font>

453
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:33,591
<font color="yellow">But.</font>

454
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:35,933
<font color="yellow">Is it really my fault?</font>

455
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:41,763
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to live like a human being
and be a good son to my mother.</font>

456
00:47:43,303 --> 00:47:46,181
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to do what others do.</font>

457
00:47:47,437 --> 00:47:52,279
<font color="yellow">They told me that's doing wrong,
and I shouldn't do anything.</font>

458
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:54,292
<font color="yellow">But I didn't want to live like that.</font>

459
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:00,335
<font color="yellow">They said me being alive is a sin.</font>

460
00:48:01,718 --> 00:48:04,991
<font color="yellow">So I'm going to fight till death
for my life and live on.</font>

461
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:07,404
<font color="yellow">And if I keep going at it</font>

462
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:12,013
<font color="yellow">I could be a help to someone else</font>

463
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:15,055
<font color="yellow">and I might find a reason to live.</font>

464
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:54,408
<font color="yellow"><i>[I wish to see my missed one again.]</i></font>

465
00:49:01,826 --> 00:49:06,587
<font color="yellow">The Chief Shamaness has attended
our meeting today to discuss the ceremony</font>

466
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:10,410
<font color="yellow">we'll be holding to wish for
the recovery of His Majesty's health.</font>

467
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:13,750
<font color="yellow">Also</font>

468
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:17,290
<font color="yellow">since His Majesty's illness is serious</font>

469
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,475
<font color="yellow">I would like to hold the ceremony
not only in Sungsuchung</font>

470
00:49:20,475 --> 00:49:23,064
<font color="yellow">but also in the Imperial Taoist Branch.</font>

471
00:49:29,507 --> 00:49:32,712
<font color="yellow">Are you planning on turning
the palace into a shaman's house?</font>

472
00:49:32,712 --> 00:49:36,551
<font color="yellow">You've went against your people's wishes
to reopen Sungsuchung.</font>

473
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:41,163
<font color="yellow">Why would you not reopen
the Imperial Taoist Branch?</font>

474
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,352
<font color="yellow">Reconstruction of
the Imperial Taoist Branch</font>

475
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:47,823
<font color="yellow">is something you've wanted, too.</font>

476
00:49:47,823 --> 00:49:49,848
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

477
00:49:50,774 --> 00:49:54,006
<font color="yellow">I would have taken care of it myself.</font>

478
00:49:54,006 --> 00:49:56,504
<font color="yellow">Whether it's the Imperial Taoist Branch
or Sungsuchung</font>

479
00:49:56,504 --> 00:50:00,810
<font color="yellow">I would have taken care of everything
without wreaking havoc like this!</font>

480
00:50:03,828 --> 00:50:07,064
<font color="yellow">I also have already selected
the right man for the position.</font>

481
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,839
<font color="yellow">So please...</font>

482
00:50:11,913 --> 00:50:14,493
<font color="yellow">just stay put, ma'am.</font>

483
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:20,768
<font color="yellow">Please hold off on your decision.</font>

484
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,754
<font color="yellow">The appointed chief of
the Imperial Taoist Branch is</font>

485
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:30,696
<font color="yellow">someone who has been serving
his duties very well for a long time</font>

486
00:50:30,696 --> 00:50:33,703
<font color="yellow">and who is an independent thinker.</font>

487
00:50:35,462 --> 00:50:38,357
<font color="yellow">I would like to appoint
Lord Choi Hyun Seo to it.</font>

488
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:09,140
<font color="yellow">I, Choi Hyun Seo</font>

489
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,366
<font color="yellow">will adhere to Queen Dowager's wishes</font>

490
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:15,105
<font color="yellow">and perform my responsibilities as
the chief of the Imperial Taoist Branch.</font>

491
00:51:38,232 --> 00:51:41,892
<font color="yellow">- Where is Lord Choi?
- He headed to Queen Dowager's place.</font>

492
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,698
<font color="yellow">Since I've reinstated you as you wished</font>

493
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:50,656
<font color="yellow">please tell me the truth now.</font>

494
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:53,234
<font color="yellow">What did you mean when you said
Hong Joo impregnated me</font>

495
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:56,736
<font color="yellow">through black magic
with a personal agenda?</font>

496
00:51:56,736 --> 00:51:59,181
<font color="yellow">She was trying to appoint a king
based on her wishes</font>

497
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:02,645
<font color="yellow">and inhibit His Majesty from passing
the throne on to his direct successor.</font>

498
00:52:02,645 --> 00:52:04,944
<font color="yellow">By preventing the production
of the direct royal descents</font>

499
00:52:04,944 --> 00:52:07,152
<font color="yellow">she's trying to destroy Joseon.</font>

500
00:52:07,152 --> 00:52:09,361
<font color="yellow">That's Hong Joo's plan.</font>

501
00:52:09,361 --> 00:52:13,167
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she's trying to
destroy this country?</font>

502
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:16,002
<font color="yellow">Hong Joo told me she'll break the curse.</font>

503
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,663
<font color="yellow">Hong Joo can't break the curse.</font>

504
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:21,337
<font color="yellow">The black magic has caused the curse</font>

505
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:24,431
<font color="yellow">and she's been bound by that magic too.</font>

506
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:28,105
<font color="yellow">Then what are we supposed to do?</font>

507
00:52:28,105 --> 00:52:31,335
<font color="yellow">Is there no way out of this?</font>

508
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:34,861
<font color="yellow">There is someone
who can break the curse.</font>

509
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:36,495
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

510
00:52:36,495 --> 00:52:39,486
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince Soonhwe's twin sister.</font>

511
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,647
<font color="yellow">The princess.</font>

512
00:52:49,263 --> 00:52:50,971
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by the princess?</font>

513
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:54,254
<font color="yellow">Queen Dowager didn't just give birth
to Crown Prince Soonhwe.</font>

514
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:58,459
<font color="yellow">She also gave birth to a twin girl,
a princess.</font>

515
00:52:58,459 --> 00:52:59,698
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

516
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:02,698
<font color="yellow">The princess was born through
a memorial service to a dead soul</font>

517
00:53:02,698 --> 00:53:04,846
<font color="yellow">and she was abandoned without a name.</font>

518
00:53:05,587 --> 00:53:08,652
<font color="yellow">Did you say a curse?</font>

519
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,609
<font color="yellow">That curse is the reason</font>

520
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:14,667
<font color="yellow">this country is full of misfortunes
and you're sick with that illness.</font>

521
00:53:18,886 --> 00:53:22,844
<font color="yellow">So Queen Dowager Yoon ordered
the princess to be killed</font>

522
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:25,944
<font color="yellow">but Lord Choi Hyun Seo
saved the princess.</font>

523
00:53:26,797 --> 00:53:28,806
<font color="yellow">Why would he?</font>

524
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:32,830
<font color="yellow">Drawn by sympathy,
he went against her orders.</font>

525
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,830
<font color="yellow">Did you say that man is back in
the Imperial Taoist Branch now?</font>

526
00:53:36,678 --> 00:53:39,250
<font color="yellow">He has sided with Queen Dowager.</font>

527
00:53:41,861 --> 00:53:46,018
<font color="yellow">Queen Dowager has ruined this
country with her mistake...</font>

528
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:50,676
<font color="yellow">and she has started something to
cover up her mistake.</font>

529
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:55,859
<font color="yellow">That princess.</font>

530
00:53:57,759 --> 00:53:59,743
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

531
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:06,024
<font color="yellow">That girl was still alive?</font>

532
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:11,551
<font color="yellow">The late king asked me to protect her.</font>

533
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:19,439
<font color="yellow">The late king knew about all of this?</font>

534
00:54:23,297 --> 00:54:26,752
<font color="yellow">How much of it did he know?</font>

535
00:54:26,752 --> 00:54:29,267
<font color="yellow">Did he know about the curse?</font>

536
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:32,397
<font color="yellow">How the prince and princess were born?</font>

537
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:35,335
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

538
00:54:40,024 --> 00:54:42,951
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

539
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:46,353
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who has brought this upon</font>

540
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:48,837
<font color="yellow">the late king and the crown prince.</font>

541
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:52,671
<font color="yellow">The princess will stop Hong Joo.</font>

542
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:59,605
<font color="yellow">She will?</font>

543
00:54:59,605 --> 00:55:03,660
<font color="yellow">I've been hiding the princess away
because I was afraid.</font>

544
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:08,152
<font color="yellow">I told her to hide from Hong Joo
and try to break the curse.</font>

545
00:55:08,152 --> 00:55:10,567
<font color="yellow">Even when her life was in danger
and there was no way out</font>

546
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:14,567
<font color="yellow">I made her stay in that place
without telling her anything.</font>

547
00:55:16,998 --> 00:55:20,502
<font color="yellow">The princess will know by now too.</font>

548
00:55:20,502 --> 00:55:23,171
<font color="yellow"><i>The fact that she can't hide anymore.</i></font>

549
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,853
<font color="yellow"><i>She's a strong person.</i></font>

550
00:55:33,853 --> 00:55:36,314
<font color="yellow"><i>She'll figure out what it is
that she has to do</i></font>

551
00:55:36,314 --> 00:55:38,879
<font color="yellow"><i>and face the person
she has to stand against.</i></font>

552
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:50,439
<font color="yellow">Sir, I have a favor to ask.</font>

553
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,817
<font color="yellow">- Seo Ri.
- I'll go.</font>

554
00:55:57,404 --> 00:55:58,721
<font color="yellow">Since she's after me</font>

555
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:02,783
<font color="yellow">the person who has made a wish
will only be safe if I go.</font>

556
00:56:02,783 --> 00:56:05,500
<font color="yellow">Even I can't win against
the Red Gentleman's Robe.</font>

557
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,892
<font color="yellow">- What if you get captured by her?
- I'm aware of this.</font>

558
00:56:09,892 --> 00:56:12,955
<font color="yellow">How dangerous and reckless this is.</font>

559
00:56:12,955 --> 00:56:16,546
<font color="yellow">I'm worried you two might get hurt.</font>

560
00:56:16,546 --> 00:56:18,571
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

561
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:22,750
<font color="yellow">I can't just do nothing for the person
who has become a target</font>

562
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,013
<font color="yellow">from trusting me and making a wish.</font>

563
00:56:26,013 --> 00:56:29,674
<font color="yellow">So, what could you do?</font>

564
00:56:29,674 --> 00:56:32,640
<font color="yellow">The only thing I could do is</font>

565
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:36,591
<font color="yellow">tell the Red Gentleman's Robe to
come see me if she wants something.</font>

566
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:39,011
<font color="yellow"><i>[I wish to see my missed one again.]</i></font>

567
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:44,957
<font color="yellow">And make sure that she can't hurt
those who've hung their wish plaques.</font>

568
00:56:44,957 --> 00:56:46,290
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

569
00:56:50,288 --> 00:56:52,158
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

570
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,007
<font color="yellow">Facing her head on is
the right thing to do.</font>

571
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,134
<font color="yellow">Why are you encouraging her?</font>

572
00:56:58,134 --> 00:57:02,658
<font color="yellow">Those cowardly people will take advantage
of you if you hide and run away.</font>

573
00:57:02,658 --> 00:57:06,178
<font color="yellow">We need to show them
we're not scared of them.</font>

574
00:57:06,178 --> 00:57:09,491
<font color="yellow">Because that's the truth. Am I right?</font>

575
00:57:55,864 --> 00:57:57,772
<font color="yellow">Are you in pain?</font>

576
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,946
<font color="yellow">So why didn't you just stay put?</font>

577
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:13,453
<font color="yellow">Why would you recklessly
try to go against me?</font>

578
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:21,486
<font color="yellow">You've probably saved me to
kill Yeon Hui.</font>

579
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,906
<font color="yellow">But.</font>

580
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:31,256
<font color="yellow">I won't be controlled by you.</font>

581
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:35,326
<font color="yellow">Is that what you think?</font>

582
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:41,321
<font color="yellow">Then give me the princess
and rest in peace.</font>

583
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:46,488
<font color="yellow">You're barely staying alive
through my black magic.</font>

584
00:58:46,488 --> 00:58:48,660
<font color="yellow">Don't you know?</font>

585
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,027
<font color="yellow">If you would like to live,
hold on to my hand.</font>

586
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:57,908
<font color="yellow">You'll regret the day
you've saved my life.</font>

587
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:02,882
<font color="yellow">No matter what,
I'll make you die with this curse</font>

588
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:05,890
<font color="yellow">that you've started.</font>

589
00:59:07,573 --> 00:59:09,053
<font color="yellow">You will?</font>

590
00:59:09,053 --> 00:59:10,533
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

591
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:15,879
<font color="yellow">You've always shown me your back.</font>

592
00:59:15,879 --> 00:59:18,600
<font color="yellow">I won't ever again show you my back</font>

593
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,681
<font color="yellow">based on an empty hope.</font>

594
00:59:24,683 --> 00:59:27,143
<font color="yellow">I would like to see you try then.</font>
