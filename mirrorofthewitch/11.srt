How did you...</font>

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,740
<font color="yellow">What about Yeon Hui?
Where is she?</font>

38
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,540
<font color="yellow">Long time no see, child.</font>

39
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,840
<font color="yellow">I can see you haven't forgotten me.</font>

40
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,940
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

41
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,740
<font color="yellow">Why did you kill those who
made wishes on the tree?</font>

42
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,340
<font color="yellow">Did I not tell you that you're cursed?</font>

43
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,840
<font color="yellow">If you'd just died that day, all those
people would've been perfectly fine.</font>

44
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,040
<font color="yellow">Do you still not realize
that you must die?</font>

45
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,040
<font color="yellow">Stop struggling. You won't be able
to use your powers in here.</font>

46
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:17,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this? What does
my curse have to do with you?</font>

47
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,840
<font color="yellow">The fact that you were born
was a mistake on my part.</font>

48
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,640
<font color="yellow">Therefore, I must be the one
to take your life.</font>

49
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,740
<font color="yellow">What... do you mean by that?</font>

50
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,940
<font color="yellow">How pitiful.
Don't be so scared.</font>

51
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,840
<font color="yellow">It'll be over before you know it.</font>

52
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,340
<font color="yellow">You were just a reject</font>

53
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,540
<font color="yellow">who never could've dreamed of
having the throne, if not for me.</font>

54
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:26,640
<font color="yellow">Don't be too upset, since you've
had your chance on the throne.</font>

55
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,640
<font color="yellow">Leave my presence, at once!</font>

56
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,940
<font color="yellow">Sir Choi? Did you cast
a soul-retaining spell on him?</font>

57
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,140
<font color="yellow">Leave the palace at once.</font>

58
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,740
<font color="yellow">You dare to possess the valuable
body of His Highness?</font>

59
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,840
<font color="yellow">- I know all about your plans.
- And?</font>

60
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,040
<font color="yellow">Are you planning to stay in there,
up until after 9 p.m.?</font>

61
00:07:52,540 --> 00:08:00,340
<font color="yellow">You're as good as dead. Your body is
only still moving thanks to black magic.</font>

62
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,240
<font color="yellow">If you were to do anything rash with
that body, your entire being would rot.</font>

63
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,540
<font color="yellow">- It matters not.
- Just try and endure it, then.</font>

64
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,840
<font color="yellow">I've waited a long time
for this day, as well.</font>

65
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,140
<font color="yellow">I won't be defeated so easily.</font>

66
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,340
<font color="yellow">Is it too much for you?</font>

67
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,740
<font color="yellow">If so, stop it already.
You'll really die at this rate.</font>

68
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,540
<font color="yellow">Don't feign concern for me!</font>

69
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,440
<font color="yellow">Sir! Sir!
Are you all right?</font>

70
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,340
<font color="yellow">I'll distract them,
so you sneak in and find Yeon Hui.</font>

71
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,440
<font color="yellow">I'm only asking you this because you're
her talisman. Not because I trust you.</font>

72
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,940
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

73
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,540
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

74
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,240
<font color="yellow">What happened?
Has Hong Joo made her move?</font>

75
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
<font color="yellow">What about His Highness?</font>

76
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,340
<font color="yellow">His Highness has followed her
into Sungsuchung!</font>

77
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,940
<font color="yellow">There isn't much time.</font>

78
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,640
<font color="yellow">How is Sir Choi faring?</font>

79
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,240
<font color="yellow">You must have been waiting
for quite a while, Crown Prince.</font>

80
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,340
<font color="yellow">All you must do now is follow
my directions. Will you do that?</font>

81
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,740
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince, use that knife to
pierce through that girl's heart.</font>

82
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,240
<font color="yellow">If you do, you'll be granted a new body.</font>

83
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,340
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Hurry and stab her!</font>

84
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,240
<font color="yellow">She's someone who should
have died in your stead anyway.</font>

85
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,340
<font color="yellow">It's all because of her
that you ended up the way you did!</font>

86
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,440
<font color="yellow">Hurry! Hurry and stab her heart!</font>

87
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,840
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and do it!</font>

88
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,440
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Stab her!</font>

89
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,140
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui!</font>

90
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,440
<font color="yellow">So it was you who was
acting as her talisman.</font>

91
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,540
<font color="yellow">It was you, wasn't it? The one
who's truly behind all the murders.</font>

92
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,940
<font color="yellow">You must realize that facing off
against me means waging your life.</font>

93
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,840
<font color="yellow">My life?
Sure, why not?</font>

94
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,140
<font color="yellow">If that's how you feel, I'm sure you
won't feel miserable about being killed.</font>

95
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,540
<font color="yellow">Kill him.</font>

96
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,140
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

97
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,540
<font color="yellow">Take Yeon Hui, and go!</font>

98
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,340
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui.</font>

99
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,390
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

100
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,790
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

101
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:18,390
<font color="yellow">How did you manage to get here in one
piece, when Yeon Hui's curse is active?</font>

102
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,590
<font color="yellow">Who's the one who
has changed their mind?</font>

103
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,790
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you know by now
that Yeon Hui is the princess.</font>

104
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,190
<font color="yellow">And you know that the people she loves,
as well as the people who love her</font>

105
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,290
<font color="yellow">are all doomed to die.
Such is her curse.</font>

106
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,990
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that the choice
will be simple for you now</font>

107
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,790
<font color="yellow">since you've broken free
from the curse now.</font>

108
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,400
<font color="yellow">We must kill the cursed princess
for this country, and His Highness.</font>

109
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,500
<font color="yellow">Will you aid me in this endeavor?</font>

110
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that the real Yeon Hui
will return if I kill you.</font>

111
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,700
<font color="yellow">If you kill me, the princess
will be cursed forever.</font>

112
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,000
<font color="yellow">And then she'll have that
horrifying appearance forever.</font>

113
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,010
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it hard for you
to see her like that?</font>

114
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:29,110
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault. That fearsome thing
is not the girl you loved, after all.</font>

115
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,710
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm saying
that we must kill her.</font>

116
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,710
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

117
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,210
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one who can
save His Highness!</font>

118
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,010
<font color="yellow">If you can't believe me,
go ahead and kill me.</font>

119
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,110
<font color="yellow">Just see what happens to
His Highness and the princess.</font>

120
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,010
<font color="yellow">Are you awake?
Are you okay?</font>

121
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,310
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt? That really
shook you up, didn't it?</font>

122
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,110
<font color="yellow">You said that you'd be by my side!</font>

123
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:42,010
<font color="yellow">You said that you were
going to stick right by me!</font>

124
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,310
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.</font>

125
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,010
<font color="yellow">I won't ever leave your side again.</font>

126
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,310
<font color="yellow">I'll stick by your side, no matter what.</font>

127
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,310
<font color="yellow">Are you all right, sir?</font>

128
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,510
<font color="yellow">Thankfully, you didn't sustain
any serious injuries.</font>

129
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:26,910
<font color="yellow">I'll soon recover, so there is
no need for you to worry.</font>

130
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,610
<font color="yellow">What happened to Poong Yeon?</font>

131
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:36,310
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui's curse
is no longer affecting him?</font>

132
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,810
<font color="yellow">I find that a bit odd too, sir.</font>

133
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:44,010
<font color="yellow">But nevertheless, it's a relief
that he's safe now.</font>

134
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,110
<font color="yellow">What did Hong Joo do to you, sir?</font>

135
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,110
<font color="yellow">Are... are you suffering from
the effects of her black magic?</font>

136
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,110
<font color="yellow">I'm only alive due to the black magic
coursing through my veins.</font>

137
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,010
<font color="yellow">Seeing as my body will
not obey my commands</font>

138
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,210
<font color="yellow">I don't think I have
much longer left to live.</font>

139
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,710
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

140
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,810
<font color="yellow">I will no longer be able
to use my body as I wish</font>

141
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,010
<font color="yellow">once it is completely
overtaken by black magic.</font>

142
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,910
<font color="yellow">And there is much that I must tell
Yeon Hui before that happens.</font>

143
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,510
<font color="yellow">Yoh Gwang.</font>

144
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,210
<font color="yellow">Sir. I will help you.</font>

145
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:04,010
<font color="yellow">- Remain seated.
- I apologize.</font>

146
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:13,510
<font color="yellow">You worked hard. Thanks to you, the
royal family has evaded a great tragedy.</font>

147
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,010
<font color="yellow">However, there is no way
that Hong Joo will just give up now.</font>

148
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,310
<font color="yellow">She won't give up easily, Your Highness.</font>

149
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,310
<font color="yellow">That child...
is called Yeon Hui, correct?</font>

150
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,110
<font color="yellow">I saw her earlier.</font>

151
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:43,210
<font color="yellow">You said that she must break the
curse for all of this to end, correct?</font>

152
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,210
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Highness.</font>

153
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,810
<font color="yellow">Are you awake, Your Highness?</font>

154
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,610
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

155
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,510
<font color="yellow">Didn't you tell me that I'd be
cured if I did as you said?</font>

156
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,110
<font color="yellow">Did you deceive me?</font>

157
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,710
<font color="yellow">I apologize, Your Highness.</font>

158
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:27,010
<font color="yellow">Choi Hyun Seo's son got in the way, and
I was not able to complete the ritual.</font>

159
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:33,210
<font color="yellow">What did you say?
How did Poong Yeon...</font>

160
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,510
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

161
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:44,310
<font color="yellow">How much do you trust
Royal Guard Choi Poong Yeon?</font>

162
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:54,010
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to cause strife
between Poong Yeon and myself?</font>

163
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,310
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I merely asked
a question out of curiosity.</font>

164
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,010
<font color="yellow">I merely wanted to know how
deep your trust in him is</font>

165
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:12,310
<font color="yellow">and whether or not that trust
could be easily broken. That is all.</font>

166
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:21,210
<font color="yellow">I hear that Sir Choi raised the princess
as if she were his own daughter.</font>

167
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,910
<font color="yellow">Her name is Yeon Hui.</font>

168
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,910
<font color="yellow">It seems that Sir Choi was not aware
of the fact that she was the princess.</font>

169
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,410
<font color="yellow">That's probably why he never
reported this to you.</font>

170
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,710
<font color="yellow">What is this place?</font>

171
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:07,210
<font color="yellow">Go inside. There's someone inside
who wishes to meet you.</font>

172
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,510
<font color="yellow">Are you... Yeon Hui?</font>

173
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:05,610
<font color="yellow">Yes. But, um...
who may you be, ma'am?</font>

174
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:14,710
<font color="yellow">I am... I...</font>

175
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:24,010
<font color="yellow">I'm sure all of this is quite sudden,
but will you hear me out?</font>

176
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,210
<font color="yellow">What exactly is going on?</font>

177
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:36,210
<font color="yellow">I don't know either. She would've
had to know sooner or later, but...</font>

178
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,810
<font color="yellow">but I do wonder if this is
the way it needed to be done.</font>

179
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,210
<font color="yellow">But I do also wonder about what other
methods we could've use instead.</font>

180
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,710
<font color="yellow">- I just... don't know.
- What?</font>

181
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,410
<font color="yellow">It's nothing you need to--</font>

182
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,310
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

183
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,250
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
- Is she meeting with Her Highness?</font>

184
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,750
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

185
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,550
<font color="yellow">We meet again, sir.</font>

186
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,640
<font color="yellow">I couldn't introduce myself properly
due to the circumstances yesterday.</font>

187
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,250
<font color="yellow">I'd like to ask you something,
if you don't mind.</font>

188
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,550
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

189
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:33,640
<font color="yellow">That Hong Joo tried to kill Yeon Hui
last night by controlling the king.</font>

190
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,250
<font color="yellow">And Hong Joo called the king
"the Crown Prince."</font>

191
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,250
<font color="yellow">Is Yeon Hui's curse related
to the king, somehow?</font>

192
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,750
<font color="yellow">A long time ago</font>

193
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,140
<font color="yellow">I received help from Hong Joo to have
children because I was barren.</font>

194
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,340
<font color="yellow">And thus, I gave birth to a pair
of beautiful twins.</font>

195
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,750
<font color="yellow">However, my children had a
curse placed upon them.</font>

196
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,340
<font color="yellow">They said that I could only
save one of my two children.</font>

197
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,940
<font color="yellow">And so, for the sake of the royal
family, I chose the Crown Prince.</font>

198
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:26,440
<font color="yellow">I... cast you, my own child, aside.</font>

199
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,750
<font color="yellow">And yet, you're still alive and well.</font>

200
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:43,140
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

201
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,840
<font color="yellow">I believe that you've
mistaken me for someone else.</font>

202
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,340
<font color="yellow">I'm a mother who does not even
have the right to plead for forgiveness.</font>

203
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,440
<font color="yellow">I shoulder the blame.
All of it.</font>

204
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,640
<font color="yellow">W-why are you acting this way?</font>

205
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,840
<font color="yellow">It's okay if you hate me and curse me.</font>

206
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,250
<font color="yellow">It's okay if you do not acknowledge
me as your mother, either.</font>

207
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:13,640
<font color="yellow">But please... break this curse.</font>

208
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,640
<font color="yellow">Last night, Hong Joo attempted
to kill you with the Crown Prince's soul</font>

209
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,050
<font color="yellow">in order to spread your curse
to the rest of the royal family.</font>

210
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:32,250
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault. It's my fault
for using black magic!</font>

211
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:39,440
<font color="yellow">It's because of my crime that my
children have been made to suffer!</font>

212
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,550
<font color="yellow">I... have no idea what
you're talking about.</font>

213
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:54,140
<font color="yellow">That shamaness told me that it was due
to a mistake on her part I was born.</font>

214
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,840
<font color="yellow">Was that... really true?</font>

215
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,640
<font color="yellow">Hong Joo will try to kill you again.</font>

216
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:10,350
<font color="yellow">We cannot allow Hong Joo
to sully the royal family any longer.</font>

217
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,440
<font color="yellow">Princess. You're the only one
who can save us.</font>

218
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,350
<font color="yellow">I'll help you in any way I can,
so please...</font>

219
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:29,850
<font color="yellow">help your older brother
escape Hong Joo's clutches.</font>

220
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:35,740
<font color="yellow">Please, save the royal family!</font>

221
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,440
<font color="yellow">My child!</font>

222
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,640
<font color="yellow">Do not call me that.</font>

223
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,040
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

224
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:24,850
<font color="yellow">Father! I missed you.
I missed you so much!</font>

225
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,940
<font color="yellow">The person in there has been
saying strange things to me.</font>

226
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,540
<font color="yellow">She said that she was my mother,
and called me "Princess."</font>

227
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,350
<font color="yellow">She said that everything
was her fault...</font>

228
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,940
<font color="yellow">and that I'm the result
of someone's mistake.</font>

229
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,640
<font color="yellow">What did she do wrong?</font>

230
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,440
<font color="yellow">Just who am I, exactly?</font>

231
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,740
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

232
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,640
<font color="yellow">- Father!
- Princess.</font>

233
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,240
<font color="yellow">I, Choi Hyun Seo, would like
to formally greet you.</font>

234
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:33,640
<font color="yellow">I locked you away in the Black Forest
in order to protect you from the curse.</font>

235
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,740
<font color="yellow">Father! Please, don't be like this!</font>

236
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:43,240
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.
Please, don't be like this.</font>

237
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that it will be difficult, but
you must accept these facts as truth.</font>

238
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,740
<font color="yellow">The only one who can face Hong Joo
and break the curse on this land</font>

239
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,940
<font color="yellow">is you alone, Princess.</font>

240
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,240
<font color="yellow">Please, stop.</font>

241
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:07,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that you had
to find out this way.</font>

242
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,140
<font color="yellow">Hong Joo is the one behind the
Red Gentleman's Robe killings.</font>

243
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,040
<font color="yellow">She's been killing innocent people,
while trying to deceive you.</font>

244
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,640
<font color="yellow">We must arrest her immediately
and confine her.</font>

245
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,440
<font color="yellow">Hong Joo told me to keep you
at arm's length</font>

246
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,040
<font color="yellow">and now you're telling me
to do the same with her.</font>

247
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,040
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

248
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,140
<font color="yellow">I trust you. Do you think
I'd trust her over you?</font>

249
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,350
<font color="yellow">Poong Yeon.</font>

250
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:12,740
<font color="yellow">I cherish you. And I believe
in your loyalty to me.</font>

251
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,940
<font color="yellow">I believe in your deep
affections for me.</font>

252
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,040
<font color="yellow">I no longer wish to fall for
Hong Joo's deceptions.</font>

253
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:33,540
<font color="yellow">The princess's name...
is Yeon Hui, eh?</font>

254
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:46,040
<font color="yellow">If you've found the princess,
bring her before me by tomorrow.</font>

255
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,850
<font color="yellow">Please do not break my trust in you.</font>

256
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,540
<font color="yellow">Why here, of all places?</font>

257
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,850
<font color="yellow">I want to ask my older brother.</font>

258
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:17,850
<font color="yellow">I can't bring myself to believe
what that woman and Father told me.</font>

259
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,640
<font color="yellow">And what if he confirms what they said?</font>

260
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,440
<font color="yellow">Will you believe it?</font>

261
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:36,940
<font color="yellow">I'd like it if my older brother
would tell me that this was all a lie.</font>

262
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:53,140
<font color="yellow">Just what is a mother?
I'm not so sure.</font>

263
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,940
<font color="yellow">Just what is a mother, anyway?</font>

264
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,350
<font color="yellow">When I was young...</font>

265
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,540
<font color="yellow">I'd come home crying after I was
teased by the neighborhood kids.</font>

266
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,040
<font color="yellow">And when that happened, my mother
would take my hand and hold it tight.</font>

267
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:29,540
<font color="yellow">Her hands were so warm.
It made me feel so much better.</font>

268
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,540
<font color="yellow">I think that all the mothers
in this world are similar.</font>

269
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:45,740
<font color="yellow">So... don't be too sad.</font>

270
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:54,540
<font color="yellow">She said that she cast me aside.
Because I was cursed.</font>

271
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:02,940
<font color="yellow">Why should I see her?
Who even am I?</font>

272
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,640
<font color="yellow">I don't even know who I really am.</font>

273
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,350
<font color="yellow">The you that I met in the
Black Forest that day</font>

274
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,640
<font color="yellow">and the you that I met once more...</font>

275
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,040
<font color="yellow">and... the you that's in
front of me right now</font>

276
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,140
<font color="yellow">are all just Yeon Hui to me.</font>

277
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,540
<font color="yellow">Whether you're cursed,
or have black or white hair</font>

278
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,540
<font color="yellow">or are a princess,
or not...</font>

279
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,140
<font color="yellow">you'll always be just Yeon Hui to me.</font>

280
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,140
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?
You've been gone for quite some time.</font>

281
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,850
<font color="yellow">I was... going around
looking for you, sir.</font>

282
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:12,350
<font color="yellow">You went missing all of a sudden, so...</font>

283
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:20,040
<font color="yellow">- Many things have happened.
- Where are you going?</font>

284
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,640
<font color="yellow">I must meet Yeon Hui.</font>

285
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,740
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

286
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,940
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine.</font>

287
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,440
<font color="yellow">I apologize, ma'am.</font>

288
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,140
<font color="yellow">Is your heart being swayed
by Young Master Poong Yeon?</font>

289
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,140
<font color="yellow">No, ma'am. It's just that he's quite
a formidable opponent, so I hesitated.</font>

290
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,540
<font color="yellow">I hear that hesitation is akin
to death for a warrior.</font>

291
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,850
<font color="yellow">But if you hesitated because your
opponent was Young Master Poong Yeon</font>

292
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:15,140
<font color="yellow">I can make him disappear for you.</font>

293
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,640
<font color="yellow">He will definitely
meet with the princess again.</font>

294
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,240
<font color="yellow">Didn't you tell me to get close to him
so that I could find the princess?</font>

295
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:30,440
<font color="yellow">This time, I will definitely find out
where the princess is hiding.</font>

296
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,140
<font color="yellow">Please give me the opportunity to do so.</font>

297
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:41,740
<font color="yellow">Heed this: there is nothing more
destructive than your own feelings.</font>

298
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:52,140
<font color="yellow">Please, don't go.
Can't you just not go?</font>

299
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:01,640
<font color="yellow">Oh, I apologize.
It's just that you don't look well.</font>

300
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:09,040
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Don't worry about me.</font>

301
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,850
<font color="yellow">Are you all right, sir?</font>

302
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,040
<font color="yellow">That man named Heo Joon...
is he close to Yeon Hui?</font>

303
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,850
<font color="yellow">A curse seal has appeared on Mr. Heo.</font>

304
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,850
<font color="yellow">He's been afflicted?</font>

305
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:06,350
<font color="yellow">I guess it's not affecting him though,
since he's a human talisman.</font>

306
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,640
<font color="yellow">So he's able to protect himself,
as well?</font>

307
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,240
<font color="yellow">You were pursuing the Red Gentleman's
Cloak before, were you not?</font>

308
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,850
<font color="yellow">Did you find them, by any chance?</font>

309
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,850
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because I really
must capture that person, too.</font>

310
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,740
<font color="yellow">But if you've found any clues,
please tell me! I'll help you!</font>

311
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,040
<font color="yellow">- Oh, are you hurt?
- I have nothing to tell you</font>

312
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,940
<font color="yellow">so please shut that mouth of yours.</font>

313
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,140
<font color="yellow">You're quite a nuisance.</font>

314
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,540
<font color="yellow">Is your body free of any scars?</font>

315
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,640
<font color="yellow">And what about your heart?</font>

316
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:12,140
<font color="yellow">Older Brother. Did you know
who I really was this whole time?</font>

317
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:16,540
<font color="yellow">I only just found out.</font>

318
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,640
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

319
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:28,240
<font color="yellow">I want to live as Father's daughter,
and as your younger sister.</font>

320
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,350
<font color="yellow">Nothing will change between us.</font>

321
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,850
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui. I'll stay by your side,
as I did before.</font>

322
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:43,040
<font color="yellow">Many people have died
because of my curse.</font>

323
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,350
<font color="yellow">And you could end up getting hurt, too.</font>

324
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,850
<font color="yellow">I don't care about the curse.</font>

325
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:00,040
<font color="yellow">Come away with me. I'll find a place
like the Black Forest for you to live in.</font>

326
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,540
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is live hidden
away in there, like you did before!</font>

327
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,940
<font color="yellow">I'll stay by your side
and protect you.</font>

328
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,850
<font color="yellow">I have something that I must show you.</font>

329
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,940
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

330
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:15,640
<font color="yellow">This is Chungbing Temple,
where I currently live.</font>

331
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:23,140
<font color="yellow">I've been living here this entire time,
trying to light all of these candles.</font>

332
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:29,040
<font color="yellow">All this in order to break the curse
and be with you and Father again.</font>

333
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,640
<font color="yellow">I'll help you to break this curse.</font>

334
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,240
<font color="yellow">I'll be by your side and help you</font>

335
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,440
<font color="yellow">so that you don't ever have to take
on such a horrifying form ever again.</font>

336
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:43,350
<font color="yellow">Older Brother!</font>

337
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,240
<font color="yellow">The me who takes
on such a horrifying form...</font>

338
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:56,540
<font color="yellow">and the me in front of you
right now... are both me.</font>

339
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:05,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Yeon Hui.
I'm quite tired today.</font>

340
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,640
<font color="yellow">I must be heading back now.</font>

341
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,540
<font color="yellow">Older Brother, please!</font>

342
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,040
<font color="yellow">Older Brother.</font>

343
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:23,850
<font color="yellow">That ghastly form is not really you.</font>

344
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,140
<font color="yellow">I'll be in touch.</font>

345
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking so much,
when you have such low tolerance?</font>

346
00:50:52,940 --> 00:51:03,140
<font color="yellow">Seol Gae. It seems that
I've hurt Yeon Hui again.</font>

347
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:09,740
<font color="yellow">I told her that I'd protect her,
but I'm not doing anything.</font>

348
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,640
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

349
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:17,140
<font color="yellow">The king told me
to bring Yeon Hui to him.</font>

350
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,350
<font color="yellow">How could fate be so cruel?</font>

351
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:29,040
<font color="yellow">How could I possibly kill Yeon Hui
with my own two hands?</font>

352
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,350
<font color="yellow">But... do you know what makes me
even more miserable than that?</font>

353
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:49,850
<font color="yellow">I worry that I may lose Yeon Hui, and
yet I'm seriously considering doing it.</font>

354
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:57,740
<font color="yellow">I'm worrying what I must do away with
Yeon Hui, for the sake of the king.</font>

355
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,640
<font color="yellow">I loathe myself for being this way.</font>

356
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:09,740
<font color="yellow">I hate the fact that I'm trying to run
away with Yeon Hui because of all this.</font>

357
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,240
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

358
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,240
<font color="yellow">I told you to get up already!
How long will you stay like that?</font>

359
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,240
<font color="yellow">You can only feign illness
for so long, you know.</font>

360
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,140
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to get fired,
hurry and head out!</font>

361
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,740
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.
Just leave me alone!</font>

362
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,350
<font color="yellow">- You terrible lout!
- "Terrible lout?"</font>

363
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:34,740
<font color="yellow">Stop it with that, already!
This is all your fault, you know!</font>

364
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,440
<font color="yellow">Obviously I seem like a terrible lout,
when you compare me to Joon.</font>

365
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
<font color="yellow">If you couldn't give me
an attractive face</font>

366
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,640
<font color="yellow">you should've at least
given me a decent brain!</font>

367
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:49,640
<font color="yellow">Father did nothing wrong!
This is all your fault!</font>

368
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,850
<font color="yellow">Stop saying things befitting
terrible louts, and eat already!</font>

369
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,850
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what this is?</font>

370
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:04,640
<font color="yellow">This is Hanwoo beef, which is
served to the king himself!</font>

371
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,640
<font color="yellow">I sent some to him so that
he would not forget about you.</font>

372
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,740
<font color="yellow">You are indeed the one who
caught the fake Red Gentleman's Cloak</font>

373
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:16,040
<font color="yellow">but it's the king who closed the case
without properly investigating it.</font>

374
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:20,850
<font color="yellow">The king may be a useful asset
to you, so you needn't worry!</font>

375
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,350
<font color="yellow">Do you really think
that he'll take my side?</font>

376
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:28,040
<font color="yellow">If Joon finds out the truth, I'm
sure he'll blame me for all of this.</font>

377
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:33,740
<font color="yellow">That's why you must move up higher,
so that he can't treat you lightly!</font>

378
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,540
<font color="yellow">That's what "Man In Ji Sang" means,
after all.</font>

379
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,850
<font color="yellow">It means a person who
stands above many others.</font>

380
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:44,740
<font color="yellow">The higher you climb, the more
authority you'll have over people!</font>

381
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:50,040
<font color="yellow">And then, you'll be able to take
care of Joon without lifting a pinky.</font>

382
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,040
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

383
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,850
<font color="yellow">There's nothing better for reinvigorating
someone than this Hanwoo beef</font>

384
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,040
<font color="yellow">so eat a lot of it,
and regain your strength.</font>

385
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,740
<font color="yellow">And then, go to the palace.
Here you are.</font>

386
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,940
<font color="yellow">Your mother will do all that she can</font>

387
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:13,940
<font color="yellow">so you must do whatever it takes to get
into the king's good graces, all right?</font>

388
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,640
<font color="yellow">Make sure you chew it properly.</font>

389
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,540
<font color="yellow">Poong Yeon!
What's going on?</font>

390
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,850
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

391
00:55:52,740 --> 00:56:01,140
<font color="yellow">If you'd just told me, I never would've
taken Yeon Hui out of the Black Forest.</font>

392
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:08,640
<font color="yellow">If I just hadn't done that, I never
would've hurt Yeon Hui like this.</font>

393
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:16,140
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?
Why, pray tell?</font>

394
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that you're facing
much inner turmoil right now.</font>

395
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:31,350
<font color="yellow">I know. Who could I
possibly blame for this?</font>

396
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:41,850
<font color="yellow">This is all my fault. It's all my fault.
Father. What do I do now?</font>

397
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:45,940
<font color="yellow">It will be fine, as long as your
feelings do not change.</font>

398
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,850
<font color="yellow">My feelings have not changed.</font>

399
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:56,740
<font color="yellow">My heart still belongs to Yeon Hui.</font>

400
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,640
<font color="yellow">She's the only woman
that I've ever loved.</font>

401
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,640
<font color="yellow">But that woman suddenly
changed into someone else.</font>

402
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,850
<font color="yellow">So how could I accept that so readily?</font>

403
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:24,740
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui hasn't changed.
She's just fallen into danger.</font>

404
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,240
<font color="yellow">You must protect her,
as her older brother!</font>

405
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:33,850
<font color="yellow">Older brother? No! I refuse! I will no
longer take on such a role in her life!</font>

406
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:39,740
<font color="yellow">Poong Yeon! What would have changed
if you did know about her curse?</font>

407
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:44,240
<font color="yellow">If you can't accept it now, I'm sure
you couldn't have accepted it before!</font>

408
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,850
<font color="yellow">Poong Yeon. As your father,
I don't want to see you get hurt.</font>

409
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:01,040
<font color="yellow">But I hope that you will do your
utmost to protect this country.</font>

410
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,440
<font color="yellow">This is what you must do,
even at the cost of your own life.</font>

411
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,440
<font color="yellow">That's what I wish from you.</font>

412
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,350
<font color="yellow">You must protect the princess.</font>

413
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:18,240
<font color="yellow">And if you can't do it as a man,
do it as her older brother.</font>

414
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,740
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

415
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,350
<font color="yellow">I don't care whether she's
a princess, or a monster!</font>

416
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:31,640
<font color="yellow">I'll get the Yeon Hui that I love back.</font>

417
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:14,740
<font color="yellow">- Sir Monk!
- Seo Ri. Run!</font>

418
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,940
<font color="yellow">Seo Ri!</font>

419
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,040
<font color="yellow">How did you...</font>

420
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:43,640
<font color="yellow">So this is where you were,
lighting these candles?</font>

421
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,850
<font color="yellow">You want to try and
break the curse, eh?</font>

422
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:02,240
<font color="yellow">You're not even aware of all the people
who are dying because of these candles.</font>

423
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:21,140
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the curse?
Everyone will die because of you.</font>

424
