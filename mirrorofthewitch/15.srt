00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:18,500
<font color="yellow"><i>[Episode 15]</i></font>

3
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:22,602
<font color="yellow">So you're saying that you'll
try to cure my illness?</font>

4
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:31,201
<font color="yellow">How could someone like you do it
when the best doctors in Joseon cannot?</font>

5
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:35,401
<font color="yellow">Your disease is not one
that doctors can cure.</font>

6
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:40,301
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you've seen many doctors
and taken hundreds of remedies</font>

7
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:45,102
<font color="yellow">but you still haven't been cured, and
that's because science cannot cure you.</font>

8
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:50,301
<font color="yellow">So, is Hong Joo's black magic
the cause, then?</font>

9
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:54,202
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've also fallen prey
to that woman's black magic.</font>

10
00:00:54,202 --> 00:00:58,001
<font color="yellow">Such is the true nature of that woman,
who you keep so close to you.</font>

11
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:02,901
<font color="yellow">Your disease, whom nobody could cure
and nobody knows the cause of...</font>

12
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:09,002
<font color="yellow">is caused by her black magic.
I'm sure of it.</font>

13
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,701
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to believe what
that shamaness told me before</font>

14
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:16,401
<font color="yellow">and I don't want to
believe you now, either.</font>

15
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:21,701
<font color="yellow">Leave immediately
if you do not wish to die.</font>

16
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:26,401
<font color="yellow">What will you do if you
sacrifice the princess</font>

17
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,201
<font color="yellow">but your disease
doesn't get any better?</font>

18
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:33,401
<font color="yellow">If that's the case, you must endure
that pain until your death.</font>

19
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:38,102
<font color="yellow">This is the only real chance you'll
ever get at curing your disease.</font>

20
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:41,602
<font color="yellow">Doesn't the fact that you've even
agreed to see me in the first place</font>

21
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:45,502
<font color="yellow">just go to prove that you're
already at your wit's end?</font>

22
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:04,302
<font color="yellow">One day.
I'll give you just one day.</font>

23
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:06,401
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and try to
prove me wrong, then.</font>

24
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:15,702
<font color="yellow">If you cannot, I'll kill both
you and Hong Joo.</font>

25
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:27,702
<font color="yellow">The fate of the princess rests on this
one day, so please aid my endeavor.</font>

26
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,501
<font color="yellow">What are you asking me
to help you with, exactly?</font>

27
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:38,702
<font color="yellow">Please lock Hong Joo up for one day so
she won't be able to use black magic.</font>

28
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:56,601
<font color="yellow">Are you all right, Young Master?</font>

29
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:04,501
<font color="yellow">Just what did you do to me?</font>

30
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:08,401
<font color="yellow">I was merely testing out your skill.</font>

31
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:13,202
<font color="yellow">It seemed that Sir Choi's powers
have been passed onto you</font>

32
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:16,501
<font color="yellow">so I just awakened your latent powers.</font>

33
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:21,001
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that your body
will need time to adjust</font>

34
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,302
<font color="yellow">since it's your first time
using your Taoist powers.</font>

35
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:31,401
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean, Taoist powers?
- Have you heard of the "sammaejinhjwa?"</font>

36
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:36,601
<font color="yellow">It's a type of power that calls
forth a holy flame.</font>

37
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:43,001
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?
How could I possibly...</font>

38
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,302
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that you're a bit
worked up right now.</font>

39
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:50,001
<font color="yellow">However, the holy flames have
the power to defeat the curse.</font>

40
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:55,202
<font color="yellow">In other words, you have the power
to do away with the princess's curse.</font>

41
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:02,702
<font color="yellow">Now, you are the only one
who can save Yeon Hui.</font>

42
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:17,801
<font color="yellow">If you feel a bit overwhelmed,
go and ask your father for advice.</font>

43
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:22,502
<font color="yellow">He'll probably give you
a wise answer.</font>

44
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:10,901
<font color="yellow">I have something to ask you.</font>

45
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:15,901
<font color="yellow">It seems that I've inherited your power.</font>

46
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,801
<font color="yellow">I've gained the power to use holy flames</font>

47
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,401
<font color="yellow">but I'm not sure as to how
I should utilize my newfound power.</font>

48
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,901
<font color="yellow">It seems that you're now walking
on the same path that I once did.</font>

49
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:28,601
<font color="yellow">You can break the princess's
curse with the holy fire.</font>

50
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:31,801
<font color="yellow">Is it true that only the evil curse
within her will be harmed by this?</font>

51
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:39,301
<font color="yellow">I should have killed the cursed princess
a long time ago with my holy flames</font>

52
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:45,101
<font color="yellow">but I could not. But we can break
her curse even without killing her.</font>

53
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:47,202
<font color="yellow">I regret not finishing the job
myself, many years ago.</font>

54
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:51,702
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me that you
once tried to kill Yeon Hui?</font>

55
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:55,002
<font color="yellow">You know that a terrible curse
has its hold on Yeon Hui, correct?</font>

56
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:59,301
<font color="yellow">However, when you took
Yeon Hui to the Black Forest...</font>

57
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:13,702
<font color="yellow">So, what must I do now?</font>

58
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:19,101
<font color="yellow">Help Hong Joo and kill
the cursed princess</font>

59
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:25,401
<font color="yellow">and protect Yeon Hui. It is for that
reason that you've inherited my power.</font>

60
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,202
<font color="yellow">Help Hong Joo?</font>

61
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:32,301
<font color="yellow">Is that truly what you wish me to do?</font>

62
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:40,002
<font color="yellow">That is what's best for
the sake of the royal family.</font>

63
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:07,702
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

64
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:21,801
<font color="yellow">I do not think that I will be able
to receive your treatment today.</font>

65
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:32,301
<font color="yellow">You'll have to stay in a cell,
just for today.</font>

66
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,901
<font color="yellow">And what is the reason behind that,
Your Highness?</font>

67
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:41,301
<font color="yellow">You told me to obey you
if I wished to live, correct?</font>

68
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:45,801
<font color="yellow">In order for me to do that, I must
keep you at a distance for today.</font>

69
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:50,002
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that your pain will be
a lot worse today, though.</font>

70
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:55,901
<font color="yellow">What are you planning that you'd even
be willing to withstand such agony?</font>

71
00:07:57,202 --> 00:08:05,301
<font color="yellow">Don't doubt me. You'll come
to know everything after today.</font>

72
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:17,801
<font color="yellow">I understand.
I'll do as you say.</font>

73
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:43,901
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon has entered the king's
chambers. What should we do?</font>

74
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:47,401
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything. This isn't something
to blow out of proportion.</font>

75
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:18,901
<font color="yellow">Then, I will do an
examination of your body.</font>

76
00:09:32,602 --> 00:09:35,002
<font color="yellow">Please take off your robe.</font>

77
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:40,201
<font color="yellow">You must do so, for me to
be able to get a good look.</font>

78
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:28,801
<font color="yellow">I apologize, Your Highness.</font>

79
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:39,201
<font color="yellow">Did you find evidence that black magic
is what is behind all this?</font>

80
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:45,401
<font color="yellow">There's no clear mark to indicate
that this was caused by black magic.</font>

81
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:52,801
<font color="yellow">What did you say?
Then, did you lie to me?</font>

82
00:10:57,401 --> 00:11:03,201
<font color="yellow">Your Highness, a student who can't trust
his teacher will never learn anything</font>

83
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:07,102
<font color="yellow">and a patient who does not trust
their doctor cannot be healed!</font>

84
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:12,301
<font color="yellow">I'm your doctor today,
so please entrust this to me.</font>

85
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:15,201
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to educate me right now?</font>

86
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:18,701
<font color="yellow">Don't misunderstand.
I'm only allowing this</font>

87
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:23,301
<font color="yellow">because you said that this was caused
by black magic, and that you'd cure me!</font>

88
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,602
<font color="yellow">So don't go blabbering
whatever you want to.</font>

89
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:31,502
<font color="yellow">If you keep doing so, I'll chop off your
head and throw it at the princess.</font>

90
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:57,602
<font color="yellow">What is Heo Joon up to?</font>

91
00:11:58,102 --> 00:12:02,201
<font color="yellow">- Sir!
- Tell me.</font>

92
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,301
<font color="yellow">What is he doing by the king's side?</font>

93
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:09,602
<font color="yellow">You can overcome this, sir!</font>

94
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:13,502
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's trying
to save the princess.</font>

95
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:17,602
<font color="yellow">Not... not yet.</font>

96
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:25,401
<font color="yellow">Right now, Yeon Hui
could potentially die, sir!</font>

97
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:49,301
<font color="yellow">You're all right now.
Now, you...</font>

98
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,301
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong with him?</font>

99
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:06,701
<font color="yellow">He lost all of his holy powers while
making a talisman for Yeon Hui</font>

100
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,602
<font color="yellow">and now he's succumbed to black magic.</font>

101
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,201
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

102
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:14,901
<font color="yellow">Then, what's happened to Sir Choi?</font>

103
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:18,102
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

104
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:23,401
<font color="yellow">He hasn't completely succumbed and
he's trying his best to fight back, but--</font>

105
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,301
<font color="yellow">Is there any way I can help?</font>

106
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:34,701
<font color="yellow">How did things go with His Highness?</font>

107
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:39,502
<font color="yellow">I searched the king's
entire body carefully</font>

108
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:42,602
<font color="yellow">but I didn't see anything indicating that
his disease was caused by black magic.</font>

109
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:46,502
<font color="yellow">I was going to ask
Sir Choi for advice, but...</font>

110
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:51,201
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time.</font>

111
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:55,002
<font color="yellow">I must go to Yeon Hui's room
and look through the spell books.</font>

112
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:10,301
<font color="yellow">Incantation.</font>

113
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,701
<font color="yellow">If she used that, she wouldn't
have left any visible marks.</font>

114
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:15,701
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

115
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:20,701
<font color="yellow"><i>It's a method of spellcasting,
by chanting words.</i></font>

116
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:35,801
<font color="yellow">Everyone will want to kill you.
Everyone will look down on you.</font>

117
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:38,901
<font color="yellow">And everyone will curse you
behind your back.</font>

118
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:45,901
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard you may try,
you'll never escape this pain.</font>

119
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:55,102
<font color="yellow">How can we break the spell
if she used that kind of method?</font>

120
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,401
<font color="yellow">The only method I know of
is to destroy the root</font>

121
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:01,801
<font color="yellow">but it'll be hard, since this
spell has no tangible root.</font>

122
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,401
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that Sir Choi
would know of a way.</font>

123
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:17,201
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

124
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:21,002
<font color="yellow">There's something that
I must investigate.</font>

125
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:25,301
<font color="yellow">It seems that Hong Joo has cast a
spell on His Highness with no root.</font>

126
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:30,301
<font color="yellow">Sir Monk called it "Unryungsool."
Is there a way to break such a spell?</font>

127
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:35,502
<font color="yellow">You do know of a way, don't you?
Please, tell us!</font>

128
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,602
<font color="yellow">- There is no way.
- Is there really no way?</font>

129
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:42,602
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I have told
you already, if there was?</font>

130
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:47,301
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui's life is at stake.
Please, think about it once more!</font>

131
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:49,801
<font color="yellow">I, too, wish to save Yeon Hui.</font>

132
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:54,801
<font color="yellow">It pains me to say this, but what
can we do, when there is no way?</font>

133
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:58,901
<font color="yellow">All we can do is accept fate.</font>

134
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:15,502
<font color="yellow">That's not something
that you would say, Sir Choi.</font>

135
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:22,301
<font color="yellow">So you were playing doctor,
weren't you?</font>

136
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:29,901
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if you knew the method,
you wouldn't be able to do anything.</i></font>

137
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:42,002
<font color="yellow">Who are you saying is truly
speaking, if it isn't me?</font>

138
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:46,701
<font color="yellow">- This is all I know.
- This is all I know.</font>

139
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:54,901
<font color="yellow">You definitely wanted
to protect Yeon Hui.</font>

140
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:58,801
<font color="yellow">Didn't you make a request of me, since
you became unable to do so yourself?</font>

141
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:12,201
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'd honestly tell you
that I don't know, when I do?</font>

142
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:20,201
<font color="yellow">If you really can't believe me, why not
go and find a method for yourself?</font>

143
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,302
<font color="yellow"><i>Your body and soul are both mine now!</i></font>

144
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:28,201
<font color="yellow"><i>You shouldn't be able to do as you wish!</i></font>

145
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:32,401
<font color="yellow">Sir! Sir!
Are you all right?</font>

146
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:36,201
<font color="yellow">Sir! Sir!</font>

147
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:40,901
<font color="yellow"><i>Do not despair. All you have to do
is act normally, as you are now.</i></font>

148
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:44,501
<font color="yellow">Look over the Grimoire of Curses.</font>

149
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:49,802
<font color="yellow"><i>There are still many things
that you must do for me.</i></font>

150
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:03,602
<font color="yellow">I completely understand.</font>

151
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:19,901
<font color="yellow">- Hey, it's time to switch.
- Already?</font>

152
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:23,501
<font color="yellow">Here. Good luck.</font>

153
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:42,901
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui!</font>

154
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:51,102
<font color="yellow">- We don't have much time.
- Are you all right?</font>

155
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:52,302
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt anywhere?</font>

156
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:54,401
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

157
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:59,501
<font color="yellow">I think I can prove that the king's
disease is the work of black magic.</font>

158
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:04,001
<font color="yellow">Sir Choi said that there should be
a solution in the Grimoire of Curses.</font>

159
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:07,701
<font color="yellow">- Father did?
- Yeah.</font>

160
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:10,501
<font color="yellow">Black magic seeps into people's hearts
through their weaknesses.</font>

161
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:14,001
<font color="yellow">And I think that's the case with the
king, after seeing him in action.</font>

162
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:18,001
<font color="yellow">So there's a solution in the
Grimoire of Curses, eh?</font>

163
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:22,001
<font color="yellow">We'll have to make him
be honest with his feelings.</font>

164
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:24,901
<font color="yellow">How about an elixir that
makes people tell only the truth?</font>

165
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:28,001
<font color="yellow">The truth elixir?</font>

166
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,901
<font color="yellow">We may be able to break the
black magic spell on him, with that.</font>

167
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:35,852
<font color="yellow">I'll need white poria cocos,
lucid asparagus</font>

168
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,302
<font color="yellow">gwigook, and picrorhizae rhizoma.</font>

169
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,501
<font color="yellow">One more thing, though.</font>

170
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:44,102
<font color="yellow">It won't have any effect if the drinker
has no desire to speak the truth.</font>

171
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:47,001
<font color="yellow">Even so, we have to give it a shot.
I'll try and make it.</font>

172
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,802
<font color="yellow">I think we'll have to leave now.</font>

173
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:58,001
<font color="yellow">This won't do. Let's leave
together now, Seo Ri.</font>

174
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:00,901
<font color="yellow">Let's leave now, and
finish lighting the candles.</font>

175
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,602
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

176
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:10,602
<font color="yellow">I've done nothing wrong.
I came here because I was sick of hiding.</font>

177
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:17,401
<font color="yellow">So I'll prove my innocence and
leave here, with confidence.</font>

178
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:25,602
<font color="yellow">All right, then.
Just trust in me, and wait.</font>

179
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:34,802
<font color="yellow">Um... was Father really
the one who helped you?</font>

180
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:40,001
<font color="yellow">He came here with Hong Joo before,
and he was acting strangely.</font>

181
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:47,201
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui. Don't worry,
and wait just a bit longer.</font>

182
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,302
<font color="yellow">I'll come back to get you soon.</font>

183
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,901
<font color="yellow">I need gwigook.
Gwigook.</font>

184
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:18,001
<font color="yellow">The gwigook is...
here's a tool for chopping.</font>

185
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:21,401
<font color="yellow">Gwigook.
Gwigook.</font>

186
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:25,001
<font color="yellow">Gwi... gook!
Gwigook!</font>

187
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:29,001
<font color="yellow">- Gwi... gook! Gwi!
- Gwi?</font>

188
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:30,901
<font color="yellow">Gwigook... gwigook.</font>

189
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:36,802
<font color="yellow">Gwigook.
Gwigook.</font>

190
00:21:37,302 --> 00:21:39,901
<font color="yellow">- Gwigook.
- Put one in, and grind it.</font>

191
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:42,802
<font color="yellow">Grind it?</font>

192
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:33,602
<font color="yellow">This is my first time making this,
but it doesn't look quite right.</font>

193
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:40,302
<font color="yellow">Maybe you're starting
to lose your memory?</font>

194
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:47,401
<font color="yellow">Let's see here.
First...</font>

195
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:56,302
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!</font>

196
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:09,802
<font color="yellow">Did you say that you'd
cure the king's ailment?</font>

197
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,602
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Highness.</font>

198
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:18,001
<font color="yellow">There is no remedy that
the king has yet to try.</font>

199
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:21,602
<font color="yellow">Don't get cocky and put
Yeon Hui in danger.</font>

200
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,401
<font color="yellow">Just do nothing.</font>

201
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:28,001
<font color="yellow">This is the only solution
available to us right now!</font>

202
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:32,401
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to entrust
Yeon Hui's life to you, then?</font>

203
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:36,302
<font color="yellow">My knowledge just may end up
saving the princess's life!</font>

204
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:38,602
<font color="yellow">I'll give it a try.</font>

205
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:45,401
<font color="yellow">If any harm befalls the
princess because of this</font>

206
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:49,802
<font color="yellow">I won't forgive you.</font>

207
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:55,302
<font color="yellow">The day I've promised you
is now at its end.</font>

208
00:24:56,201 --> 00:25:02,701
<font color="yellow">If any harm befalls my body
or you cannot cure my ailment</font>

209
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,302
<font color="yellow">I'll execute both you and the princess.</font>

210
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:10,901
<font color="yellow">Let them in.</font>

211
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:42,701
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

212
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:46,001
<font color="yellow">This is medicine that can
cure your ailment.</font>

213
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:51,802
<font color="yellow">- And who is the one who made this?
- Me, Your Highness.</font>

214
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:56,001
<font color="yellow">You're telling me to drink
the medicine you've made</font>

215
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:59,901
<font color="yellow">even though you're not even a doctor?</font>

216
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,201
<font color="yellow">Is that what you're
telling me right now?</font>

217
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:05,401
<font color="yellow">You've entrusted your
body to me, have you not?</font>

218
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:07,701
<font color="yellow">I told you to get me evidence
that this was caused by black magic.</font>

219
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:16,001
<font color="yellow">I never said that I'd drink some mystery
elixir that just may be poisonous.</font>

220
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:18,701
<font color="yellow">I know very well that
you have your reservations.</font>

221
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:24,602
<font color="yellow">However, please trust that I'm genuinely
concerned for the princess.</font>

222
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:27,401
<font color="yellow">Such are the feelings that I put into
making this for you, Your Highness.</font>

223
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,701
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!
He cannot be trusted!</font>

224
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:48,701
<font color="yellow">Please, reconsider!</font>

225
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:38,701
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!
Your Highness!</font>

226
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:42,802
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!
Your Highness!</font>

227
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:47,302
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!
Your Highness!</font>

228
00:27:56,501 --> 00:28:01,401
<font color="yellow">Kill... kill that man.</font>

229
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:04,001
<font color="yellow">- Capture this man!
- Yes, sir!</font>

230
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:09,501
<font color="yellow">Your Highness.
Your Highness!</font>

231
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:11,802
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

232
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:30,201
<font color="yellow">Mr. Heo!
What's going on?</font>

233
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:32,602
<font color="yellow">The king fainted!</font>

234
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:04,302
<font color="yellow">My expectations of you were high. Who
knew things would end so pathetically?</font>

235
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:09,201
<font color="yellow">It's not over yet.
You're still alive, after all.</font>

236
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:14,602
<font color="yellow">Don't you get it?
You're the one who will be dying now.</font>

237
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:18,802
<font color="yellow">No. That won't happen.</font>

238
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:23,001
<font color="yellow">What did you do to Father?</font>

239
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:30,102
<font color="yellow">He made a talisman for you, and
ended up losing his life in the process.</font>

240
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:34,001
<font color="yellow">And when that happened,
I saved him.</font>

241
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:39,901
<font color="yellow">Father... died?
What did you do to him?</font>

242
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:44,302
<font color="yellow">Sir Choi and I are of
one mind and body now.</font>

243
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:48,701
<font color="yellow">If you kill me, he'll die too.</font>

244
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:54,602
<font color="yellow">Please remember that he will die slowly
beside me whenever you light a candle.</font>

245
00:30:55,102 --> 00:31:02,201
<font color="yellow">I will turn my father back to normal
so that you can never touch him again.</font>

246
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:05,998
<font color="yellow">Sure. Go ahead and try.</font>

247
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:26,400
<font color="yellow">Our deal is off. Now you'll have to deal
with the consequences of your words.</font>

248
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:32,700
<font color="yellow">Your Highness.</font>

249
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,298
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

250
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,998
<font color="yellow">It wasn't enough that the
princess attacked me</font>

251
00:31:41,998 --> 00:31:46,100
<font color="yellow">you tried to kill me with poison, too?</font>

252
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,700
<font color="yellow">I'll sentence you two
to death by drowning.</font>

253
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,498
<font color="yellow">King! You must not kill the princess!</font>

254
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:05,498
<font color="yellow">The curse upon the royal family
will only worsen if you kill her!</font>

255
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:07,600
<font color="yellow">Please return to your quarters!</font>

256
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,900
<font color="yellow">You'll be the next one executed.</font>

257
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,700
<font color="yellow">- King!
- Leave right now!</font>

258
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,700
<font color="yellow">Are... you scared of the princess,
Your Highness?</font>

259
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,798
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

260
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:33,498
<font color="yellow">- Or do you fear Hong Joo?
- Don't blubber on carelessly!</font>

261
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:35,998
<font color="yellow">Are you scared of losing the throne?</font>

262
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,100
<font color="yellow">What are you so scared of
that you've been rendered to this?</font>

263
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,998
<font color="yellow">You have the most power and
authority among all of us here!</font>

264
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:46,700
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth!</font>

265
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:56,400
<font color="yellow">I know that you accuse me of being
a cruel tyrant behind my back.</font>

266
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,298
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why the princess
tried to kill me?</font>

267
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:04,700
<font color="yellow">I wasn't trying to kill you.</font>

268
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,400
<font color="yellow">How could I kill you,
the king of this country?</font>

269
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,100
<font color="yellow">All I wanted to do was protect you
from Hong Joo's evil plans.</font>

270
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:25,100
<font color="yellow">See? There are even people
who wish to protect you!</font>

271
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,998
<font color="yellow">No. No. There are only people
who wish to kill me in this country!</font>

272
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:34,700
<font color="yellow">There are only those who wish
to pry my power away from me!</font>

273
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
<font color="yellow">And you lot are the same.</font>

274
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,600
<font color="yellow">Why did you trust me, then?</font>

275
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,700
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- You let me stay at the palace</font>

276
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,298
<font color="yellow">and you listened to what I
had to say, did you not?</font>

277
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,200
<font color="yellow">You could have easily killed me,
or ignored me!</font>

278
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,200
<font color="yellow">However, you trusted me
and took the medicine.</font>

279
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,600
<font color="yellow">What made you so desperate
that you believed me?</font>

280
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,700
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it for the sake of
protecting the throne?</font>

281
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,500
<font color="yellow">Or did you want to give up the throne?</font>

282
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,500
<font color="yellow">If you say one more word,
I'll kill you right now.</font>

283
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,600
<font color="yellow">You just wanted to make an example of us</font>

284
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,899
<font color="yellow">to those who say that you don't
have the right to be king, didn't you?</font>

285
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:35,100
<font color="yellow">You wanted to be acknowledged
as the rightful ruler of this land.</font>

286
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,799
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

287
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:06,399
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be acknowledged by others.</font>

288
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,200
<font color="yellow">Do you think I became king
because I wanted to?</font>

289
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:26,700
<font color="yellow">You don't know how much pressure
and fear comes with this position.</font>

290
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:35,299
<font color="yellow">People looked down upon me for being
a mere half-relative to the royal family.</font>

291
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,600
<font color="yellow">They spread malicious rumors about me,
and made fun of me...</font>

292
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,700
<font color="yellow">and tried to kill me, too.</font>

293
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,899
<font color="yellow">I want to do my best, too.</font>

294
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:54,899
<font color="yellow">And I want to be acknowledged, too!</font>

295
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,100
<font color="yellow">I wanted to become a
good king to my subjects.</font>

296
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:13,700
<font color="yellow">But... no matter how hard
I tried, it wouldn't work.</font>

297
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,600
<font color="yellow">So what am I supposed to do, exactly?</font>

298
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:33,350
<font color="yellow">Now, due to my illness, there's
nothing that I can do anymore.</font>

299
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:44,750
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can do
for this damned country!</font>

300
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,642
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

301
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:52,549
<font color="yellow">That was the black magic
plaguing your body this whole time.</font>

302
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,950
<font color="yellow">- Capture her!
- Yes, sir!</font>

303
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:52,950
<font color="yellow">Did you truly think that you'd
survive after you did this to me?</font>

304
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,950
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

305
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,549
<font color="yellow">Are you pretending that
you know nothing about the fact</font>

306
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:58,850
<font color="yellow">that you cast black magic
on the royal family?</font>

307
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:03,950
<font color="yellow">How could a mere shamaness
dare to do that?</font>

308
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:09,950
<font color="yellow">All I've ever done was use my powers
for the royal family, as you've wished.</font>

309
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,651
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

310
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:16,151
<font color="yellow">If you truly believe yourselves to be
innocent, then feel free to punish me!</font>

311
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:24,350
<font color="yellow">You're the one who wanted to have
an heir no matter what it took, Queen.</font>

312
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,549
<font color="yellow">And you're the one who
asked me to cure your ailment</font>

313
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:33,049
<font color="yellow">even if I had to kill the
princess to do it.</font>

314
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:36,049
<font color="yellow">So what have I done wrong, exactly?</font>

315
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,549
<font color="yellow">Impudent wench.</font>

316
00:39:40,651 --> 00:39:44,549
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to bring us all down with
you so you can get out of this?</font>

317
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:52,350
<font color="yellow">That's right. I can't disgrace
the royal family just to punish you.</font>

318
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,850
<font color="yellow">Send them in!</font>

319
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,049
<font color="yellow">Tell me what crimes you've committed.</font>

320
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:35,651
<font color="yellow">I killed people under the orders of the
Chief Shamaness of Sungsuchung.</font>

321
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:41,549
<font color="yellow">I brought people's hearts to her,
and she used them for black magic.</font>

322
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,850
<font color="yellow">- Is this the truth?
- Yes.</font>

323
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:54,549
<font color="yellow">You still claim that you are innocent?</font>

324
00:40:56,049 --> 00:41:00,850
<font color="yellow">So, what will you do now?</font>

325
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:09,850
<font color="yellow">Will you slice me into pieces?</font>

326
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,950
<font color="yellow">- You wench!
- You asked me for help</font>

327
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,750
<font color="yellow">saying you'd do anything,
and now you're "unearthing the truth?"</font>

328
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,049
<font color="yellow">You royal family members
have always done this to me.</font>

329
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:22,350
<font color="yellow">You're weak, feeble, and cowardly.</font>

330
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,350
<font color="yellow">You people never change,
no matter how much time passes.</font>

331
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,750
<font color="yellow">Make sure that you're careful, too.</font>

332
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,350
<font color="yellow">They're keeping you by them
because they need you now</font>

333
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:40,151
<font color="yellow">but you, too, will be
cast aside like a stray dog.</font>

334
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:43,750
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth!
Come forth!</font>

335
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,850
<font color="yellow">I'll have you torn limb from limb,
for everyone to see.</font>

336
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,750
<font color="yellow">- Come over here!
- Wow!</font>

337
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,950
<font color="yellow">Hurry it up!
Come on!</font>

338
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,549
<font color="yellow">Here, here, sit!</font>

339
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,350
<font color="yellow">- Hey, did you know?
- What?</font>

340
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,950
<font color="yellow">That bastard, Heo Joon,
is all locked up now.</font>

341
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,850
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

342
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:03,549
<font color="yellow">- Forever. And ever.
- So, you caught him?</font>

343
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,750
<font color="yellow">Um, of course.
I guess you can say that I did.</font>

344
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,450
<font color="yellow">- Really!
- So what's happening to him?</font>

345
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,750
<font color="yellow">Him? Well, he was captured
after trying to poison the king</font>

346
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,151
<font color="yellow">so he'll definitely be
torn limb from limb.</font>

347
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,651
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, I've never seen
an unluckier guy than him!</font>

348
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:24,950
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

349
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:33,750
<font color="yellow">Hey, if he'd just laid low when I let
him, he wouldn't be on death row now!</font>

350
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,151
<font color="yellow">That man!
Over there!</font>

351
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:41,549
<font color="yellow">That man is wanted for
lying to the king! Arrest him!</font>

352
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:43,750
<font color="yellow">- Arrest that man, now!
- Yes, sir!</font>

353
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,750
<font color="yellow">- Drag him out!
- Wait a second!</font>

354
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:51,850
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you taking me?
Huh? I'm higher ranked than you!</font>

355
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,350
<font color="yellow">Hey! What's your name, punk?</font>

356
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:07,450
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

357
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:16,850
<font color="yellow">That shamaness told me that Father
had already died a while ago.</font>

358
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,350
<font color="yellow">That's a lie, right?</font>

359
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:30,151
<font color="yellow">Sir Choi is no longer able
to move or act as he wishes.</font>

360
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:38,250
<font color="yellow">If we get rid of the black magic
spell on him, he may return to normal.</font>

361
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,350
<font color="yellow">But his dead body is only moving
right now because of the spell</font>

362
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:49,250
<font color="yellow">so if we break the spell on him,
he will surely die on the spot.</font>

363
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:55,350
<font color="yellow">Then, when she said that they were
one in body and mind...</font>

364
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:01,350
<font color="yellow">When she dies,
Sir Choi will die as well.</font>

365
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:10,750
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

366
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:19,049
<font color="yellow">You were truly the
Red Gentleman's Robe this whole time?</font>

367
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:26,350
<font color="yellow">Answer me. Are you truly the
Red Gentleman's Robe?</font>

368
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:31,950
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

369
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,950
<font color="yellow">Did I seem like
that much of a joke to you?</font>

370
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:52,950
<font color="yellow">Was it funny, helping me search
for the Red Gentleman's Robe</font>

371
00:46:54,651 --> 00:46:56,850
<font color="yellow">despite the fact that it was
you this whole time?</font>

372
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,151
<font color="yellow">Did I seem like a fool to you?</font>

373
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:02,950
<font color="yellow">- That wasn't my intention. I just--
- I trusted you.</font>

374
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:13,750
<font color="yellow">I truly regarded you as a close friend,
and I was so thankful for your efforts.</font>

375
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:20,350
<font color="yellow">And yet...
you... you...</font>

376
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:35,651
<font color="yellow">Did you only spend time with me
due to your ulterior motive?</font>

377
00:47:38,049 --> 00:47:43,950
<font color="yellow">Who am I supposed to trust now?</font>

378
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:52,250
<font color="yellow">Please do not forgive me.</font>

379
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,651
<font color="yellow">Despite all this,
you were still my friend.</font>

380
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:25,549
<font color="yellow">This is my last act
of friendship to you.</font>

381
00:49:41,151 --> 00:49:44,151
<font color="yellow">All the thorns that had appeared
on your skin are now gone</font>

382
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:47,151
<font color="yellow">and you have no scarring left.</font>

383
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:55,151
<font color="yellow">Yes. Thank you.</font>

384
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,350
<font color="yellow">- Um, Your Highness.
- What?</font>

385
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:20,651
<font color="yellow">Since you're completely cured,
could you do me a favor?</font>

386
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:24,350
<font color="yellow">Yes. As for what you wanted...</font>

387
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,350
<font color="yellow">Didn't I already release the princess
as I said I would, though?</font>

388
00:50:34,651 --> 00:50:40,651
<font color="yellow">I mean, shouldn't you have done that
anyway, since we proved our innocence?</font>

389
00:50:40,651 --> 00:50:43,750
<font color="yellow">Hmm, well, yes.</font>

390
00:50:49,151 --> 00:50:55,750
<font color="yellow">When I think of how much you humiliated
me, I want to chop your head off!</font>

391
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,651
<font color="yellow">Leave now.</font>

392
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:17,151
<font color="yellow">Um, go ahead and tell me what you want.</font>

393
00:51:22,651 --> 00:51:27,950
<font color="yellow">I can't think of anything now,
but can I cash in this favor later?</font>

394
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:31,750
<font color="yellow">You wily rascal.</font>

395
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:36,350
<font color="yellow">Stop smiling.</font>

396
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,250
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui!</font>

397
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,250
<font color="yellow">Were you waiting for me?</font>

398
00:52:09,549 --> 00:52:13,350
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure where I should start
looking for my father.</font>

399
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:25,750
<font color="yellow">- Hong Joo... Hong Joo has...
- What about her?</font>

400
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,350
<font color="yellow">What did she do this time?</font>

401
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,549
<font color="yellow">Hong Joo has escaped.</font>

402
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,850
<font color="yellow">I am in your debt, Young Master.</font>

403
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,350
<font color="yellow">Don't misunderstand.</font>

404
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:49,151
<font color="yellow">I'll make you pay for your sins after
I've turned Yeon Hui back to normal.</font>

405
00:52:53,049 --> 00:52:55,750
<font color="yellow">What must I do now?</font>

406
00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:00,350
<font color="yellow">All you must do is bring forth your holy
flames when my preparations are complete.</font>

407
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,549
<font color="yellow">Will Yeon Hui really go back
to normal after I set her aflame?</font>

408
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:08,651
<font color="yellow">You still can't trust me, sir?</font>

409
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,850
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm sure you'll find out
when you go ahead and try it.</font>

410
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:17,549
<font color="yellow">Was my first encounter with Sol Gae
all a part of your plan?</font>

411
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:19,950
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

412
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,950
<font color="yellow">You truly are a fearsome individual.</font>

413
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:29,750
<font color="yellow">One needs to see the big picture
to bring forth a big revolution.</font>

414
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:34,651
<font color="yellow">Furthermore, revolutions must be
carried out without feelings attached.</font>

415
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:40,151
<font color="yellow">You must ensure that Sol Gae is the
last one you show your weakness towards.</font>

416
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:55,151
<font color="yellow">If Hong Joo has disappeared,
I'm sure she's up to something.</font>

417
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,450
<font color="yellow">And I'm sure that it will
put you in danger.</font>

418
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:01,350
<font color="yellow">We'll have to post some
guards near your chambers.</font>

419
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:05,750
<font color="yellow">- I'm all right.
- Yeon Hui.</font>

420
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,151
<font color="yellow">You are now a part of the royal family.</font>

421
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:11,950
<font color="yellow">You must remember that your well-being
is linked to the well-being of this land.</font>

422
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,350
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

423
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:22,950
<font color="yellow">Furthermore, distance yourself
from that man, Heo Joon.</font>

424
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:28,250
<font color="yellow">I know that he has been
of much help to you.</font>

425
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:35,350
<font color="yellow">I'm quite thankful toward him for that.
However, you're the princess.</font>

426
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:39,049
<font color="yellow">You can't just let a commoner like him
accompany you like he had before.</font>

427
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:46,049
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to find a
suitable position for him.</font>

428
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,651
<font color="yellow">He's someone I've given my heart to.</font>

429
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:06,049
<font color="yellow">It seems that your feelings
for him run quite deep.</font>

430
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,950
<font color="yellow">Will giving you some time suffice?</font>

431
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:39,049
<font color="yellow">I feel a bit relieved that the Queen
ordered royal soldiers to guard us.</font>

432
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:59,750
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui. I think I'll have to find
a way to earn a living now.</font>

433
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,250
<font color="yellow">So I don't think I'll be able
to come see you too often.</font>

434
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:14,750
<font color="yellow">But, I'll continue to watch over you</font>

435
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:19,350
<font color="yellow">until you light all the candles,
and until you're completely safe.</font>

436
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,250
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

437
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:40,850
<font color="yellow">Go and get some rest now.
You don't look too good.</font>

438
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,750
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hui!</font>

439
01:00:44,651 --> 01:00:49,049
<font color="yellow"><i>[Mirror of the Witch]</i></font>

440
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:53,651
<font color="yellow"><i>You know, Yeon Hui, I'd like
it if you lived a rosy life.</i></font>

441
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,850
<font color="yellow"><i>Will you be able to handle Sir Choi?</i></font>

442
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,350
<font color="yellow"><i>- Mr. Heo!
- You can't kill or save them.</i></font>

443
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:02,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Just what is that shamaness that she
can cause such an uproar?</i></font>

444
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,049
<font color="yellow"><i>Sir Choi Hyun Seo will help us.</i></font>

445
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:08,549
<font color="yellow"><i>Where is my father now?</i></font>

446
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:13,549
<font color="yellow"><i>I saved him with my black magic,
when he'd died due to the princess.</i></font>

447
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:16,850
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't see that man who's
usually always by your side.</i></font>

448
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:20,151
<font color="yellow"><i>Why would he come with me,
when I came to die?</i></font>
