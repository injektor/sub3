00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,956
<font color="yellow">Are you happy to see me?</font>

5
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:31,655
<font color="yellow">Of course. You know how long
I've searched for you.</font>

6
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:35,956
<font color="yellow">Have you come to meet your brother?</font>

7
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:47,656
<font color="yellow">That's my brother?</font>

8
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:53,855
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be so callous. He ended
up like that because of you, after all.</font>

9
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:18,555
<font color="yellow">What you do is so detestable that
I can no longer bear to sit and watch.</font>

10
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:31,555
<font color="yellow">Oh my. So you're
killing your brother after all.</font>

11
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:36,755
<font color="yellow">The Queen will be saddened
to know what you've done.</font>

12
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:39,956
<font color="yellow">If one of us must die...</font>

13
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:45,356
<font color="yellow">shouldn't I be the one to live, since
I'm the one who's actually alive?</font>

14
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:51,656
<font color="yellow">Stop this nonsense
and give that back right now.</font>

15
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:57,555
<font color="yellow">I created you two. Thus, I'll be the
one to decide who lives and who dies.</font>

16
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:14,155
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you'll try to use
the king to try and kill me again.</font>

17
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:22,256
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many people
have died due to your horrific acts?</font>

18
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,256
<font color="yellow">Just go ahead and do it, then.</font>

19
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:41,356
<font color="yellow">Do you think I won't be able to kill you
just because the Crown Prince is gone?</font>

20
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:57,655
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

21
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:02,356
<font color="yellow">I'll just see for myself</font>

22
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:06,756
<font color="yellow">whether or not using this
is the only way you could kill me.</font>

23
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:44,655
<font color="yellow">Where is the princess?
Take me to her.</font>

24
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,756
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

25
00:03:56,956 --> 00:04:00,756
<font color="yellow">Sir! Sir!</font>

26
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:12,456
<font color="yellow">Sir! Please snap out of it!</font>

27
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:34,455
<font color="yellow">You're already back
from the memorial site?</font>

28
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:38,656
<font color="yellow">I changed my mind, so I came back.</font>

29
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:44,156
<font color="yellow">Did you call the princess to the palace?</font>

30
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,755
<font color="yellow">And if I did?</font>

31
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:55,255
<font color="yellow">You'll have to hide her well.</font>

32
00:04:55,955 --> 00:05:00,156
<font color="yellow">I searched all of Joseon to find her.</font>

33
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:04,555
<font color="yellow">So finding her in the palace
will be a simple feat.</font>

34
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,656
<font color="yellow"><i>The princess is in the palace.</i></font>

35
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:39,755
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure about this?
- I'm sure that the Queen has her.</font>

36
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,555
<font color="yellow">The Queen, eh?</font>

37
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:44,755
<font color="yellow">She may have found out that we intend
to use her as a sacrifice to heal you.</font>

38
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:47,856
<font color="yellow">And so, she decided to
hide her within the palace.</font>

39
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:53,856
<font color="yellow">She will try to meddle with my affairs,
so we must capture her before then.</font>

40
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:58,455
<font color="yellow">How nice of her to walk right in
here, on her own two feet.</font>

41
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:02,555
<font color="yellow">I really wish to see the princess.
Hurry and bring her to me.</font>

42
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,356
<font color="yellow">I don't think that the Queen will easily
relinquish her hold on the Princess</font>

43
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:08,755
<font color="yellow">so I'll have to hunt for her.</font>

44
00:07:08,755 --> 00:07:11,455
<font color="yellow">Hunt, eh?</font>

45
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:15,455
<font color="yellow">If you'd just grant me permission
and means to do so within the palace</font>

46
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,955
<font color="yellow">I'll capture her for you.</font>

47
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:24,255
<font color="yellow">No. The hunt is more thrilling
to partake in than to watch.</font>

48
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:27,156
<font color="yellow">I'll be the one doing the hunting.</font>

49
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:34,555
<font color="yellow">- Then, I'll do the spectating.
- All right.</font>

50
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:50,356
<font color="yellow">It'd be best to perform funeral rites on
the Crown Prince as soon as possible.</font>

51
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:58,656
<font color="yellow">I will ask Father... no, Mr. Choi,
about how we can perform the rites.</font>

52
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:00,856
<font color="yellow">We can take our time.</font>

53
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:09,312
<font color="yellow">Just... let me be with him
for a bit longer.</font>

54
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:19,411
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll wait until you're ready.</font>

55
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:29,012
<font color="yellow">No. I'm sure that Hong Joo is already
devising a plot to capture you.</font>

56
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:35,612
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if we can complete the
rites safely with her on the loose.</font>

57
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:44,612
<font color="yellow">There's something you must do, Queen.</font>

58
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:56,411
<font color="yellow">Great job. Where is the princess--</font>

59
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,711
<font color="yellow">Your body and soul are both mine now!</font>

60
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:13,411
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be able to move
or think of your own free will!</font>

61
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:23,211
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

62
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:32,311
<font color="yellow">Please don't despair.</font>

63
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:39,211
<font color="yellow">You're fine now, aren't you? You need
to just stay the way you are now.</font>

64
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,711
<font color="yellow">I'll help you.</font>

65
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:47,411
<font color="yellow">I wish to live as a person.</font>

66
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:52,112
<font color="yellow">There is much you must do for me.</font>

67
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:36,311
<font color="yellow">- Um, about before, at Banchon--
- No need for thanks.</font>

68
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:38,612
<font color="yellow">I did it for Yeon Hui.</font>

69
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:42,211
<font color="yellow">Even so, I'm thankful.</font>

70
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,612
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

71
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:50,411
<font color="yellow">- If that's all, leave now.
- No, I'm not done.</font>

72
00:10:55,112 --> 00:11:00,711
<font color="yellow">On the day you came to Banchon,
did you come with your guard?</font>

73
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:02,811
<font color="yellow">You know, the woman named Sol Gae?</font>

74
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,311
<font color="yellow">I did. So what?</font>

75
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:10,811
<font color="yellow">I was just wondering if you two
always travel together.</font>

76
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:14,311
<font color="yellow">That's none of your business.</font>

77
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:18,711
<font color="yellow">She seems like a faithful warrior.
Since when has she been with you?</font>

78
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:24,711
<font color="yellow">What is it that you really wish to know?</font>

79
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:32,311
<font color="yellow">Just how deep her loyalty to you is.</font>

80
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:38,512
<font color="yellow">How much do you trust that Sol Gae?</font>

81
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:43,711
<font color="yellow">She's my right-hand woman, and my sword.</font>

82
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:47,512
<font color="yellow">In other words,
I trust her with my life.</font>

83
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:50,612
<font color="yellow">Since I've answered your question,
tell me why you've asked me this.</font>

84
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:54,112
<font color="yellow">I asked you this because the king is
searching for the Red Gentleman's Robe.</font>

85
00:11:55,811 --> 00:12:03,612
<font color="yellow">If I catch the Red Gentleman's Robe,
what would you do?</font>

86
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:10,112
<font color="yellow">I am no longer the
captain of the royal guard.</font>

87
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:15,211
<font color="yellow">However, if it's for His Highness
and Yeon Hui</font>

88
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:19,411
<font color="yellow">I will help you discover who
the Red Gentleman's Robe is.</font>

89
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:26,411
<font color="yellow">There is someone I suspect
may be the Red Gentleman's Robe.</font>

90
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:31,411
<font color="yellow">When I am certain that it is them,
I'll tell you who it is.</font>

91
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:53,311
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
- What brings you here?</font>

92
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:56,811
<font color="yellow">There's nothing for you to do, so go get
some rest at home until I call for you.</font>

93
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,612
<font color="yellow">Your face...</font>

94
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:09,211
<font color="yellow">You have a fever.
Are you ill?</font>

95
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:14,112
<font color="yellow">No, sir. It's because it's hot outside.</font>

96
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:17,311
<font color="yellow">I'll follow you even if there's
nothing for me to do, sir.</font>

97
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:19,411
<font color="yellow">No, there's no need for that.</font>

98
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:23,311
<font color="yellow">Red Gentleman's Robe.</font>

99
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:34,512
<font color="yellow">If I manage to catch them as I said,
I'll hand them over to you.</font>

100
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:53,211
<font color="yellow">So, um, the ex-captain Choi Poon Yeon
met with his younger sister</font>

101
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:55,012
<font color="yellow">and I pursued them.</font>

102
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:58,711
<font color="yellow">But she got into a palanquin
and disappeared, so...</font>

103
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:02,711
<font color="yellow">there was someone I knew next to
her, too, so I watched him closely</font>

104
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:06,311
<font color="yellow">but he disappeared, too...</font>

105
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:08,311
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

106
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:19,612
<font color="yellow">Out of my utmost loyalty for you,
I searched every nook and cranny I could</font>

107
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:23,612
<font color="yellow">but they're nowhere to be found,
Your Highness!</font>

108
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,711
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

109
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:29,811
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

110
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:34,112
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your unending grace,
Your Highness!</font>

111
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:39,811
<font color="yellow">So you're telling me that you know what
Poong Yeon's sister looks like, correct?</font>

112
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:45,811
<font color="yellow">Yes. I saw her myself!</font>

113
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:51,012
<font color="yellow">She has a coldness about her face,
but she has a great body</font>

114
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:57,811
<font color="yellow">and she has shining, doe-like eyes!
Yes.</font>

115
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:00,612
<font color="yellow">You really got a good
look at her, didn't you?</font>

116
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:05,411
<font color="yellow">Well, I've had a knack for noticing
details since I was young--</font>

117
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:07,811
<font color="yellow">There is something
that you must do for me.</font>

118
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,911
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Highness?</font>

119
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,112
<font color="yellow">It's something that you
have a real talent for.</font>

120
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:34,612
<font color="yellow">- Your Highness.
- What is it?</font>

121
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:40,512
<font color="yellow">The ex-captain, Choi Poong Yeon,
has requested an audience with you.</font>

122
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,612
<font color="yellow">What is the reason
that you've come to see me?</font>

123
00:15:49,612 --> 00:15:51,911
<font color="yellow">I have something to ask
of you, Your Highness.</font>

124
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:54,112
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

125
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:56,411
<font color="yellow">I know that Yeon Hui is in the palace.</font>

126
00:15:56,411 --> 00:16:02,711
<font color="yellow">I've bought clothes for her to wear,
and I'd like to give them to her myself.</font>

127
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:07,411
<font color="yellow">Ah, I did hear that you two
parted without a proper farewell.</font>

128
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:12,012
<font color="yellow">However, Yeon Hui cannot meet you now,
so leave this here and go.</font>

129
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,112
<font color="yellow">I'll pass this along to her.</font>

130
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:17,811
<font color="yellow">Your Highness, there is someone who
is after Yeon Hui's life in the palace.</font>

131
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,211
<font color="yellow">How long will you be keeping her here?</font>

132
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:24,811
<font color="yellow">I will take her.</font>

133
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,612
<font color="yellow">You do know that she's
the Princess, do you not?</font>

134
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,811
<font color="yellow">There is something
she must do for the royal family</font>

135
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:33,512
<font color="yellow">so worry not, and take your leave.</font>

136
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:38,512
<font color="yellow">Are you not concerned in the
slightest for Yeon Hui's well-being?</font>

137
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:40,711
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

138
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:45,211
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!
Your Highness!</font>

139
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:49,612
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

140
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:27,411
<font color="yellow">How could you betray me
and side with the Queen?</font>

141
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:33,612
<font color="yellow">What is the meaning of this?</font>

142
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:38,511
<font color="yellow">How dare you barge in here
with your soldiers in tow?</font>

143
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:39,911
<font color="yellow">I'm not here to attack you.</font>

144
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:44,612
<font color="yellow">I heard that you may be in danger,
so I came to protect you.</font>

145
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:47,211
<font color="yellow">- Tell her what you saw.
- Yes, sir!</font>

146
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:52,612
<font color="yellow">Well, um, that is, um...</font>

147
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:57,112
<font color="yellow">there's a witch who's been the cause
of many bad rumors within the country.</font>

148
00:17:57,112 --> 00:17:59,011
<font color="yellow">As, um, the captain of the royal guard</font>

149
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:04,411
<font color="yellow">I was pursuing that witch in case she
poses a threat to our nation's security.</font>

150
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,812
<font color="yellow">But I saw her enter your room!</font>

151
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:12,011
<font color="yellow">I was so surprised that I reported it to
the king, and ran over here. Yes.</font>

152
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:16,312
<font color="yellow">You said that you saw that witch
with your own eyes, correct?</font>

153
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:19,612
<font color="yellow">Yes.
Indeed, I did.</font>

154
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:25,211
<font color="yellow">And I think that she's hidden herself
somewhere near the Queen's quarters.</font>

155
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,711
<font color="yellow">Are you seriously trying to
use that pathetic excuse of a tale</font>

156
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:37,211
<font color="yellow">to try and be rid of me?</font>

157
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:41,312
<font color="yellow">King! Why not just accuse me
of treason, instead?</font>

158
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:44,812
<font color="yellow">Give me a legitimate
reason for your doing this!</font>

159
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,312
<font color="yellow">What would I gain by kicking you out?</font>

160
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:57,812
<font color="yellow">It's not like be you'll be
the ruler forever.</font>

161
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:02,312
<font color="yellow">You'll have to step down from your
position anyway, when I'm cured.</font>

162
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:09,011
<font color="yellow">I was just worried about you, so I
dragged my sickly body all the way here!</font>

163
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:12,812
<font color="yellow">So are you telling me to be touched
to tears by that, or something?</font>

164
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:17,711
<font color="yellow">I cannot allow you to defile my quarters
for such ridiculous reasons.</font>

165
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:22,812
<font color="yellow">Take your soldiers
and leave, immediately!</font>

166
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:28,511
<font color="yellow">Surely this is not something to get
so worked up over, Your Highness.</font>

167
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:31,511
<font color="yellow">I merely wish to check and see
if there may be anything here</font>

168
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:36,511
<font color="yellow">that may be a danger to you.</font>

169
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,112
<font color="yellow">- Search the room!
- Yes, sir!</font>

170
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:13,812
<font color="yellow">I think there may be something
behind that folding screen.</font>

171
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:34,211
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

172
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:41,511
<font color="yellow">Your court is gathered at the reception
hall, and are waiting for you.</font>

173
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,112
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

174
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:06,211
<font color="yellow">Is something the matter?</font>

175
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:16,911
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

176
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:22,211
<font color="yellow">She's Princess Yeon Hui,
the late Crown Prince's sister.</font>

177
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:32,011
<font color="yellow">I'd like to officially introduce
myself to you. My name is Yeon Hui.</font>

178
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:40,411
<font color="yellow">What is the meaning of this,
all of a sudden? Explain.</font>

179
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:44,211
<font color="yellow">I heard that the princess, who was
thought to have died during childbirth</font>

180
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:48,312
<font color="yellow">was actually alive.</font>

181
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:52,011
<font color="yellow">Therefore, I searched
far and wide for her.</font>

182
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:58,711
<font color="yellow">Starting today, I'd like to officially
announce Yeon Hui as the Princess.</font>

183
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:07,812
<font color="yellow">I guess it's true, then.</font>

184
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:15,711
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about the rumor that
the queen actually gave birth to twins.</font>

185
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:22,011
<font color="yellow">Having twins is bad enough,
but keeping it hidden, at that?</font>

186
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:28,112
<font color="yellow">Queen! Is what the king said
really the truth?</font>

187
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:37,612
<font color="yellow">You mustn't dishonor the royal family
by putting things like that, King.</font>

188
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:41,011
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say
in regards to the fact</font>

189
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:43,011
<font color="yellow">that I had twins
makes you feel uncomfortable.</font>

190
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:46,211
<font color="yellow">This was something that was
decided upon by the heavens, after all.</font>

191
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:51,812
<font color="yellow">The princess who was born
as the Crown Prince's twin...</font>

192
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:58,812
<font color="yellow">because of her, the country and
the royal family have been cursed.</font>

193
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:04,411
<font color="yellow">I also heard a rumor that
she's the cause of my illness.</font>

194
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,812
<font color="yellow">What do you make of that?</font>

195
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:17,411
<font color="yellow">If that rumor is true,
I will take responsibility.</font>

196
00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:22,411
<font color="yellow">If the punishment is the loss of your
title, will you be able to handle it?</font>

197
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,011
<font color="yellow">If you want to dismiss me
from my position</font>

198
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:36,112
<font color="yellow">you must prove that she really is
the source of the curse upon this land.</font>

199
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:41,812
<font color="yellow">If it's true, I won't have to prove it</font>

200
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:44,711
<font color="yellow">since the downfall of our
country will serve as such.</font>

201
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:49,312
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll dismiss you
from your position then.</font>

202
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:54,511
<font color="yellow">Before you start accusing me of crimes</font>

203
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:59,312
<font color="yellow">shouldn't we celebrate,
since the princess has returned to us?</font>

204
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:03,211
<font color="yellow">Are you not happy?</font>

205
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:11,312
<font color="yellow">Yes. I couldn't possibly be happier.</font>

206
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:17,011
<font color="yellow">I really did wish to see the princess
that I'd heard so much about.</font>

207
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:30,312
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

208
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:34,112
<font color="yellow">I'm all right.</font>

209
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:41,312
<font color="yellow">Right now, your safety takes priority,
so just worry about that.</font>

210
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:56,711
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on returning
to the palace, Your Highness.</font>

211
00:25:56,711 --> 00:26:00,411
<font color="yellow">Make sure you always bow your
head before the princess, just like that</font>

212
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:03,011
<font color="yellow">and mind your manners.</font>

213
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:18,511
<font color="yellow">If anything happens to her,
I'll blame it on you, no matter what.</font>

214
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:21,612
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what I'm saying?</font>

215
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:28,812
<font color="yellow">That does not sound quite fair,
Your Highness.</font>

216
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:32,711
<font color="yellow">We will soon perform funeral rites</font>

217
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:36,711
<font color="yellow">at the Imperial Taoist Branch
for Crown Prince Soonhwe.</font>

218
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:42,711
<font color="yellow">I'd like for you to help us,
since you're the Chief Shamaness.</font>

219
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,411
<font color="yellow">How about it?</font>

220
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:48,612
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

221
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:11,612
<font color="yellow">Have you delivered the message
to the Red Gentleman's Robe?</font>

222
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:14,812
<font color="yellow">Yes. I told her to keep herself
and the ceramic urn hidden</font>

223
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:17,812
<font color="yellow">and then to bring it here at 9:00 p.m.</font>

224
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:42,711
<font color="yellow">Hey, Red Gentleman's Robe!
I missed you so much!</font>

225
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:46,812
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, what's up with
the violent greeting?</font>

226
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,312
<font color="yellow">Why don't you put that down, first?</font>

227
00:27:56,312 --> 00:27:59,011
<font color="yellow">I feel bad fighting you
when you're handicapped.</font>

228
00:28:05,612 --> 00:28:08,411
<font color="yellow">You didn't use the medicine
that I gave you?</font>

229
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:32,911
<font color="yellow">Sol Gae. Who gave you that name?</font>

230
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,312
<font color="yellow">Was it the people who sold you,
or was it Hong Joo?</font>

231
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:41,411
<font color="yellow">If you tell...
Poong Yeon who I am...</font>

232
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:44,812
<font color="yellow">I'll... kill...</font>

233
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:19,112
<font color="yellow">Just keep acting
stupidly confident, Princess.</font>

234
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:25,011
<font color="yellow">Soon, you'll feel humiliated for
not realizing that you have a fake.</font>

235
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:51,612
<font color="yellow">You've come?</font>

236
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:56,711
<font color="yellow">We were just about to get started.</font>

237
00:29:57,812 --> 00:30:04,612
<font color="yellow">You also had a special relationship with
him, so shouldn't you say farewell?</font>

238
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:09,812
<font color="yellow">You cherished him so much.</font>

239
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:13,911
<font color="yellow">How could I possibly
compare my grief to yours?</font>

240
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:17,812
<font color="yellow">Well, it also pained me greatly
to see him go, as well.</font>

241
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:23,812
<font color="yellow">- Did it really?
- Yes, Princess.</font>

242
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:31,112
<font color="yellow">Then why did you swap
his cremains with a fake one?</font>

243
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:40,312
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince.</font>

244
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,400
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Say your farewells to him.</font>

245
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:33,661
<font color="yellow">I will wish for him to have
a pleasant afterlife.</font>

246
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:36,362
<font color="yellow">This isn't the end.</font>

247
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:46,661
<font color="yellow">I've resolved to pay for my crimes,
and will ensure that you do the same.</font>

248
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:18,261
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

249
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:22,562
<font color="yellow">I'll go and get some air for a bit.</font>

250
00:33:54,562 --> 00:34:00,761
<font color="yellow">So if you send the Prince's spirit off,
she won't be able to kill you, right?</font>

251
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:08,861
<font color="yellow">- Seo Ri!
- Sir Monk!</font>

252
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,261
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

253
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:15,861
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness.</font>

254
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:20,861
<font color="yellow">What about Father?
I haven't seen him.</font>

255
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:23,560
<font color="yellow">- Where is he?
- That is...</font>

256
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:27,661
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

257
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:42,761
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes. I'm fine.</font>

258
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:46,661
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

259
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,861
<font color="yellow">You brought him back safely, didn't you?</font>

260
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,661
<font color="yellow">I think it'd be best to hurry
and finish the funeral rites.</font>

261
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:09,761
<font color="yellow">Please escort the Queen here.</font>

262
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,060
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

263
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:17,761
<font color="yellow">Please go with Yeon Hui.</font>

264
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:22,060
<font color="yellow">Oh... yes.
Let's go.</font>

265
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:45,560
<font color="yellow">Sir, are you really all right?</font>

266
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:49,361
<font color="yellow">You needn't worry about me.</font>

267
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,861
<font color="yellow">Do I have to call you "Princess" now?</font>

268
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:12,761
<font color="yellow">No. This is just a protective
measure of sorts.</font>

269
00:36:12,761 --> 00:36:18,861
<font color="yellow">The title will help protect me.
So don't worry too much.</font>

270
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:22,060
<font color="yellow">I'm not worried.
I'm just scared.</font>

271
00:36:26,261 --> 00:36:30,761
<font color="yellow">I'm scared that I'll be
separated from you again.</font>

272
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,560
<font color="yellow">- Older Brother.
- What's going on?</font>

273
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,361
<font color="yellow">Do not follow us. I want to
speak to her privately.</font>

274
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,261
<font color="yellow">Change into this, and meet me outside.
Let's leave this place.</font>

275
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:24,861
<font color="yellow">I know that you're doing this
because you're afraid I'll be in danger.</font>

276
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:26,060
<font color="yellow">But--</font>

277
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,161
<font color="yellow">Not only Hong Joo, but the
king is also after your life!</font>

278
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:31,560
<font color="yellow">So how could you just
march in here?</font>

279
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,261
<font color="yellow">It's because everyone
who is after my life is here.</font>

280
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,261
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stay close and see
what they're planning for myself.</font>

281
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:49,361
<font color="yellow">That's the only way I can really defend
myself against them, and stop them.</font>

282
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,261
<font color="yellow">That is all I have time to think about.</font>

283
00:37:54,161 --> 00:37:57,460
<font color="yellow">I don't have the luxury to be worrying
about the relationship between us.</font>

284
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:06,761
<font color="yellow">I tried my best not to
avoid you when you transformed.</font>

285
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:10,261
<font color="yellow">I tried my best to overcome my fears!</font>

286
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:17,460
<font color="yellow">And I... wanted to protect you,
as a man.</font>

287
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,361
<font color="yellow">So why is it that you
won't give me a chance?</font>

288
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,761
<font color="yellow">The only reply I can give you...</font>

289
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:40,361
<font color="yellow">is this.</font>

290
00:38:56,261 --> 00:39:02,161
<font color="yellow">Don't ever turn your back on me again.</font>

291
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,261
<font color="yellow">Let go. I'm sure that
you're hurting Yeon Hui.</font>

292
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:14,861
<font color="yellow">This isn't something for you
to be getting involved in.</font>

293
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:22,261
<font color="yellow">I told you to let go.</font>

294
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,861
<font color="yellow">Let go of him.</font>

295
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:33,361
<font color="yellow">Let go of him, okay? Now.</font>

296
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,261
<font color="yellow">Let go of me, too, Older Brother.</font>

297
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:48,161
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go with him.</font>

298
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,397
<font color="yellow">If I let go of your hand now...</font>

299
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,361
<font color="yellow">you will never see
your older brother again.</font>

300
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:10,261
<font color="yellow">Queen.</font>

301
00:41:50,361 --> 00:42:00,560
<font color="yellow">Abra...cadabra.
Abra...cadabra.</font>

302
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:19,761
<font color="yellow">Abra...cadabra.
Abra...cadabra.</font>

303
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:34,761
<font color="yellow">Abra...cadabra.
Abra...cadabra.</font>

304
00:42:47,261 --> 00:42:51,060
<font color="yellow">- Sir Monk!
- What happened?</font>

305
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:57,861
<font color="yellow">They snuck up on me, I was blindsided.</font>

306
00:42:58,361 --> 00:43:00,761
<font color="yellow">What about Father?</font>

307
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,161
<font color="yellow">Thankfully, he'd stepped out
for a bit when this happened.</font>

308
00:43:31,261 --> 00:43:34,261
<font color="yellow">Great job.</font>

309
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:03,661
<font color="yellow">The urn is gone.</font>

310
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:23,861
<font color="yellow">You insolent wench!
You're at it again!</font>

311
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:28,661
<font color="yellow">You can't fight fate
no matter how hard you try, Queen.</font>

312
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:36,361
<font color="yellow">Your fate is to choose for
one of your two children to live.</font>

313
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,761
<font color="yellow">Since you've chosen the princess,
I'll do as I wish with the Prince.</font>

314
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:46,661
<font color="yellow">What are you planning
to do with the prince?</font>

315
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:50,261
<font color="yellow">That's none of your business.</font>

316
00:44:50,261 --> 00:44:51,560
<font color="yellow">I'll do with him as I wish</font>

317
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,560
<font color="yellow">whether that may be letting him
rot in hell forever, or making him king.</font>

318
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,761
<font color="yellow">The Crown Prince is no
longer your child, after all.</font>

319
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:03,161
<font color="yellow">What the hell are you saying?
The Crown Prince is my child!</font>

320
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:04,861
<font color="yellow">He's my son, damn you!</font>

321
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:07,460
<font color="yellow">Didn't you cast him aside, though?</font>

322
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,560
<font color="yellow">- I've never once done that!
- Then...</font>

323
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,560
<font color="yellow">you should've let me kill the princess
so I could bring him back to life.</font>

324
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,661
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have called her here
to have her challenge me!</font>

325
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:21,761
<font color="yellow">None of this would've happened
if Crown Prince were still alive!</font>

326
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:26,560
<font color="yellow">If you'd killed her properly the first
time, my son would still be alive!</font>

327
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,761
<font color="yellow">Do you get it now?</font>

328
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:43,060
<font color="yellow">Do you understand why the Crown Prince's
life takes priority over yours?</font>

329
00:46:09,261 --> 00:46:11,060
<font color="yellow">My son!</font>

330
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:59,460
<font color="yellow">You've cast Yeon Hui aside,
but all she ever did was protect you.</font>

331
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:49,861
<font color="yellow">Don't ever mess with
my children, ever again.</font>

332
00:49:42,661 --> 00:49:44,560
<font color="yellow">You okay?</font>

333
00:51:28,361 --> 00:51:31,060
<font color="yellow">This is a Dream Elixir.</font>

334
00:51:31,661 --> 00:51:33,060
<font color="yellow">If you drink this</font>

335
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,361
<font color="yellow">you'll be able to see the person
you want to see in your dreams.</font>

336
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:39,560
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that you'll have
trouble falling asleep tonight</font>

337
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,060
<font color="yellow">so drink this before you go to sleep.</font>

338
00:52:05,161 --> 00:52:09,161
<font color="yellow">- That one looks like you.
- That one?</font>

339
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:11,060
<font color="yellow">- That one looks like me?
- Yes!</font>

340
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,761
<font color="yellow">I really don't see the resemblance.</font>

341
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,761
<font color="yellow">Mother, you've turned your head.
Tilt it a bit more this way.</font>

342
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,361
<font color="yellow">Yes, like that!</font>

343
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,861
<font color="yellow"><i>If I were to take the memory of just one
day with me as I go on to the afterlife</i></font>

344
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:10,261
<font color="yellow"><i>I'd choose a day like today</i></font>

345
00:53:10,261 --> 00:53:14,161
<font color="yellow"><i>when we laughed together
about nothing in particular.</i></font>

346
00:53:14,161 --> 00:53:20,261
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll use this day to give me hope
until the day that we will be reunited.</i></font>

347
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:27,060
<font color="yellow"><i>I pray that day will come soon.</i></font>

348
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:22,460
<font color="yellow">All I have left now is you.</font>

349
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,560
<font color="yellow">Only your skill can kill the princess</font>

350
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:36,460
<font color="yellow">so you must end her life
with the holy fire this time.</font>

351
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,761
<font color="yellow">That's the last page
of the Grimoire of Curses.</font>

352
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:27,761
<font color="yellow">Only the sacrifice of someone who truly
loves Yeon Hui can light the last candle.</font>

353
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:33,261
<font color="yellow">If Hong Joo finds out about that,
Mr. Heo will be in danger.</font>

354
00:56:33,861 --> 00:56:35,861
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

355
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:45,560
<font color="yellow">Yoh Gwang. If I become
evil once more, kill me.</font>

356
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:53,261
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.
I won't!</font>

357
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:04,261
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you. If I'm a danger
to Yeon Hui, you must not hesitate</font>

358
00:57:04,261 --> 00:57:06,661
<font color="yellow">and save Yeon Hui.</font>

359
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:19,861
<font color="yellow">Please kill me before Poong Yeon
and Yeon Hui see me in my evil state.</font>

360
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,361
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

361
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:30,560
<font color="yellow">Am I crazy to want an apology from you?</font>

362
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,960
<font color="yellow">I mean, it really did hurt
when you stabbed me.</font>

363
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:40,761
<font color="yellow">People who seek me out only
ever threaten me, or plead with me.</font>

364
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:43,861
<font color="yellow">So which one will it be for you?</font>

365
00:59:45,661 --> 00:59:48,560
<font color="yellow">I'm curious about something.</font>

366
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,761
<font color="yellow">About the girl that you
stuck onto Poong Yeon...</font>

367
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:55,261
<font color="yellow">what were you going to do
if she hadn't found Yeon Hui?</font>

368
00:59:55,861 --> 00:59:58,661
<font color="yellow">Are you the one who returned
the proper urn to her?</font>

369
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:06,261
<font color="yellow">You know, I'm debating how I should
use this trump card in my hand.</font>

370
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:11,661
<font color="yellow">- What should I do?
- What is it that you want?</font>

371
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:16,560
<font color="yellow">Stop bothering Yeon Hui,
and stop killing people.</font>

372
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,361
<font color="yellow">That's all I want from you.</font>

373
01:00:19,361 --> 01:00:25,761
<font color="yellow">I'll think about whether or not
I'll honor your simple request.</font>

374
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:27,960
<font color="yellow">I'll give you some time.</font>

375
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:49,361
<font color="yellow">He has Sol Gae.
Follow him.</font>

376
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:33,060
<font color="yellow">Wow, this is great. The soup
here is especially great today.</font>

377
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:37,861
<font color="yellow">When you're feeling weak, there's
nothing better than beef soup and rice!</font>

378
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,960
<font color="yellow">Just look at this beef.</font>

379
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,861
<font color="yellow">So tender!</font>

380
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,361
<font color="yellow">Huh? Hey, you!</font>

381
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,460
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're right!
The soup really is amazing!</font>

382
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:03,361
<font color="yellow">Wow. Here, let me get some.</font>

383
01:02:04,261 --> 01:02:06,460
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

384
01:02:08,861 --> 01:02:14,661
<font color="yellow">- Wow, look at that.
- What's with you?</font>

385
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,261
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

386
01:02:23,361 --> 01:02:26,361
<font color="yellow">Just shush up, and eat.</font>

387
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,861
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

388
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:41,460
<font color="yellow">As for the hunt... I gave the Queen
a lot less credit than she deserved.</font>

389
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,861
<font color="yellow">The princess has been
formally introduced to the court</font>

390
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:47,060
<font color="yellow">so it'll be difficult to
capture her now.</font>

391
01:02:47,861 --> 01:02:54,560
<font color="yellow">If we don't sacrifice her, you'll keep
having thorns sprout from your body.</font>

392
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:58,861
<font color="yellow">How about we take care of
another thorn in your side?</font>

393
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:01,661
<font color="yellow">I mean the Queen, who is
protecting the Princess.</font>

394
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:14,161
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to get rid
of the Queen, somehow?</font>

395
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:22,361
<font color="yellow">There's no way that I'd allow that.
I'll pretend that I didn't hear that.</font>

396
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:33,361
<font color="yellow">So, if anything happens to the Queen,
it won't be my fault.</font>

397
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that it's difficult for you
to forget about the Prince.</font>

398
01:04:12,161 --> 01:04:18,361
<font color="yellow">Worry not.
I'll send you to his side soon.</font>

399
