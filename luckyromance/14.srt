2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,930
<font color="yellow">all responsibility.</font>

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,330

5

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,300

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,470

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,870
<font color="yellow">If he's wealthy, he'll lose all of his wealth.</font>

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color="yellow">When he loses everything from his fame to wealth...</font>

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,670

13

15

18
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,170

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,330
<font color="yellow">It'll work out.</font>

23
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,430
<font color="yellow">I really hope it does.</font>

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,070

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,320
<font color="yellow">Wasn't that movie was really moving?</font>

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,840
<font color="yellow">That's what you cried, right?</font>

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,040
<font color="yellow">Not because of me?</font>

35
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,250
<font color="yellow">I know you'll say it's nonsense,</font>

36
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,120
<font color="yellow">but what if this is because of me?</font>

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,650
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

38
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,080
<font color="yellow">this happened to you and Zeze...</font>

39
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,650

46

48
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,850
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

49
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,450
<font color="yellow">You're not allowed to worry.</font>

50
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,620
<font color="yellow">You're not allowed to doubt.</font>

51

-  No.</font>

58
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,920
<font color="yellow">This isn't your fault.</font>

59
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,480
<font color="yellow">Never. It's not because of you.</font>

60
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,330
<font color="yellow">This could be a coincidence.</font>

61
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,350

65

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,790
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

158
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,450
<font color="yellow">I will hurry out and buy something to eat.</font>

159
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,380
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Bo Nui.</font>

160
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,790
<font color="yellow">How can you clear up everything so fast?</font>

161
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,580
<font color="yellow">Is your body the only thing you have now?</font>

162
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,520
<font color="yellow">This is more than enough.</font>

163
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,480
<font color="yellow">Stay here. I'll get my car.</font>

164
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,420
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  Where are you?</font>

165
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,920
<font color="yellow">I'm at the office. I wanted to see your face.</font>

166
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,350
<font color="yellow">I'm outside running an errand. I think it will take a long time.</font>

167
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,650
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

168
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,350
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

169
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,750
<font color="yellow">Take care going back.</font>

170
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,350
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

171
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,350
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho.</font>

172
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

173
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,950
<font color="yellow">I'll put this at my place.</font>

174
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho.</font>

175
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,150
<font color="yellow">Je Soo Ho.</font>

176
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,080
<font color="yellow">What? What is it?</font>

177
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,750
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

178
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,850
<font color="yellow">You can't be yourself right now.</font>

179
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,850
<font color="yellow">You never rested a day and spent all your 20s on Zeze Factory.</font>

180
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,420
<font color="yellow">How would you have felt walking away from it voluntarily?</font>

181
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,850
<font color="yellow">I am so sorry.</font>

182
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,150
<font color="yellow">I am sorry that I couldn't protect you.</font>

183
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,650
<font color="yellow">I should have sold my shares to...</font>

184
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,320
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

185
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,000
<font color="yellow">Don't give up your place as the major shareholder.</font>

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,620
<font color="yellow">You have to protect IF and my team.</font>

187
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,200
<font color="yellow">- Soo Ho.
-  Stop it!</font>

188
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,450
<font color="yellow">But I can't stop crying.</font>

189
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,580
<font color="yellow">Why would you cry?</font>

190
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,840
<font color="yellow">Stay with me for a while.</font>

191
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,020
<font color="yellow">Please clean up for me.</font>

192
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,340
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard I clean, it looks like a pig sty.</font>

193
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,420
<font color="yellow">I won't go to a pig sty.</font>

194
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,500
<font color="yellow">Just for a few days. I'm looking for a flat for you.</font>

195
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,750
<font color="yellow">Don't waste your money on a useless thing.</font>

196
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,850
<font color="yellow">Spend it only when I ask you.</font>

197
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,820
<font color="yellow">Then where will you stay?</font>

198
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

199
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,750
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

200
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,650
<font color="yellow">Tell me where you are going!</font>

201
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,720
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why did I cry for him?</font>

202
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

203
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,550
<font color="yellow">He's completely mad.</font>

204
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,720
<font color="yellow">Your company is bankrupting, you know?</font>

205
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,550
<font color="yellow">- Who is it?
-  Your boyfriend.</font>

206
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,320
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je!
-  Take my bag. Hurry.</font>

207
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,780
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

208
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,720
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

209
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,950
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

210
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,680
<font color="yellow">I sold my house, remember? I don't have a place to stay.</font>

211
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,420
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

212
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,250
<font color="yellow">- I'm staying here for a while.
-  What?</font>

213
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,150
<font color="yellow">You know I'm unemployed now. I don't have a place to go.</font>

214
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,470
<font color="yellow">You could go to Mr Han's.</font>

215
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,850
<font color="yellow">I can't go there. I can't possibly live there.</font>

216
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,940
<font color="yellow">It's a pig sty.</font>

217
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,180
<font color="yellow">How about your parents' house then?</font>

218
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,570
<font color="yellow">That's near the water.</font>

219
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,080
<font color="yellow">I can't go near the water.</font>

220
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,650
<font color="yellow">You went there with me before.</font>

221
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,540
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I don't know.</font>

222
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,850
<font color="yellow">I don't have a car and it's too far.</font>

223
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,880
<font color="yellow">And as a moral citizen, you shouldn't do that.</font>

224
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,620
<font color="yellow">You should help the less fortunate.</font>

225
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,620
<font color="yellow">Besides, it's your boyfriend we're talking here.</font>

226
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,250
<font color="yellow">Your boyfriend.</font>

227
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,750
<font color="yellow">Your boyfriend.</font>

228
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,550
<font color="yellow">I am your boyfriend.</font>

229
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
<font color="yellow">Your boyfriend.</font>

230
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,280
<font color="yellow">- Are you serious?
-  I'm sorry. I can't accept you.</font>

231
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,520
<font color="yellow">But it's not the first time.</font>

232
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,720
<font color="yellow">- Still, you can't.
-  Then where should I sleep?</font>

233
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,020
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

234
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,940
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

235
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,520
<font color="yellow">I will go to a sauna and sleep there.</font>

236
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,120
<font color="yellow">Okay. You go in and sleep.</font>

237
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,320
<font color="yellow">- Go in and sleep.
-  Okay.</font>

238
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good night.</font>

239
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,040
<font color="yellow">Bye. Sweet dreams.</font>

240
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,280
<font color="yellow">- Bo Nui, wait! Bo Nui!
-  I am really sorry.</font>

241
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,780
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

242
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,280
<font color="yellow">Why would you do it then?</font>

243
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,020
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

244
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,550
<font color="yellow">I just dropped her off.</font>

245
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,180
<font color="yellow">But I feel sorry to go home.</font>

246
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I feel so sad. Bo Nui!</font>

247
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,650
<font color="yellow">I am hungry.</font>

248
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,050
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy.
-  Thank you.</font>

249
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,520
<font color="yellow">Where's your father?</font>

250
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,950
<font color="yellow">He's at the temple he's been staying.</font>

251
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,650
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to convince him to go to Canada with me, but he won't listen.</font>

252
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,390
<font color="yellow">You have a lot of time now.</font>

253
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,980
<font color="yellow">You can go back and forth to see each other.</font>

254
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

255
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,580
<font color="yellow">It's so hard to say that.</font>

256
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,480
<font color="yellow">By the way, why did you quit Zeze Factory?</font>

257
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,380
<font color="yellow">I had to.</font>

258
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,750
<font color="yellow">They will still succeed to develop IF.</font>

259
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,170
<font color="yellow">That was my condition for leaving.</font>

260
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,770
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to bet your position.</font>

261
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,280
<font color="yellow">It wasn't because of you, Gary.</font>

262
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,320
<font color="yellow">I did that because...</font>

263
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,750
<font color="yellow">- the original developer is pretty.
-  Gosh...</font>

264
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,120
<font color="yellow">It's important for both you and Bo Nui.</font>

265
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,420
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I really don't like you.</font>

266
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,220
<font color="yellow">I need to see flaws in order to take you down.</font>

267
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,350
<font color="yellow">But the more I see you, the more I think you're a good man.</font>

268
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,250
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you realised that just now.</font>

269
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,080
<font color="yellow">If you have nowhere to go, you can stay at my place.</font>

270
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,990
<font color="yellow">I'll let you in.</font>

271
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,620
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

272
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,920
<font color="yellow">I have a girlfriend. Why would I stay at your place?</font>

273
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,320
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd pretend to be your friend. I don't like it, either.</font>

274
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,380
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

275
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,420
<font color="yellow">It's just that I saw Bo Nui kicking you out a while ago.</font>

276
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,990
<font color="yellow">You saw that?</font>

277
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,910
<font color="yellow">Don't give Bo Nui a hard time.</font>

278
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,410
<font color="yellow">When did I give her a hard time? I didn't do anything to her.</font>

279
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,410
<font color="yellow">Then why would a kind girl like her kick you out?</font>

280
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,240
<font color="yellow">Exactly. I don't know the reason.</font>

281
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,520
<font color="yellow">If you know, please tell me.</font>

282
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,020
<font color="yellow">Anyway, don't make her cry.</font>

283
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,180
<font color="yellow">She cried enough.</font>

284
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,150
<font color="yellow">You make sure...</font>

285
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,550
<font color="yellow">You make sure to make her laugh.</font>

286
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,780
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to answer?</font>

287
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,680
<font color="yellow">She will never cry because of me.</font>

288
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,580
<font color="yellow">I would be the one crying because of Bo Nui.</font>

289
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,580
<font color="yellow">It's good. Why aren't you eating?</font>

290
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,040
<font color="yellow">I was going to eat it.</font>

291
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,880
<font color="yellow">It's good. They have good noodles.</font>

292
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,550
<font color="yellow">It's a complete defeat.</font>

293
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,150
<font color="yellow">Game over.</font>

294
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,250
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

295
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,620
<font color="yellow">(Where are you?)</font>

296
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,340
<font color="yellow">(To Mr Je)</font>

297
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,750
<font color="yellow">Did you find somewhere to go?</font>

298
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,180
<font color="yellow">Would you like to come...</font>

299
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,720
<font color="yellow">(Would you like to come...)</font>

300
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,680
<font color="yellow">(To Mr Je)</font>

301
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,180
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  Were you worrying about me?</font>

302
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,350
<font color="yellow">I don't see any stars tonight.</font>

303
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,150
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

304
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,050
<font color="yellow">It's just for one day.</font>

305
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,020
<font color="yellow">One day? Of course it is.</font>

306
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,180
<font color="yellow">A day in the living room and another in your room.</font>

307
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,320
<font color="yellow">The others on the bunk bed and in the kitchen. It'll be a month then.</font>

308
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,250
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

309
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,880
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you can find a place tomorrow.</font>

310
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,380
<font color="yellow">Of course I can. That's why I'm not looking.</font>

311
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

312
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,750
<font color="yellow">Do you not like being with me?</font>

313
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,080
<font color="yellow">- No, but...
-  Okay, that's enough.</font>

314
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
<font color="yellow">Four days.</font>

315
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,150
<font color="yellow">I'll take 4 days and add 3 more. How about a week?</font>

316
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,150
<font color="yellow">- Fine.
-  Really?</font>

317
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,050
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

318
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,520
<font color="yellow">You can laugh if it's funny.</font>

319
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,150
<font color="yellow">You laughed.</font>

320
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

321
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

322
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,950
<font color="yellow">let's go to sleep.</font>

323
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,220
<font color="yellow">- Just once.
-  No, I don't want to.</font>

324
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,990
<font color="yellow">- Please.
-  Go away.</font>

325
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,320
<font color="yellow">Was this necessary?</font>

326
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,620
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

327
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,740
<font color="yellow">This is important.</font>

328
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,940
<font color="yellow">It shows that this place is your home...</font>

329
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,660
<font color="yellow">and that you feel totally comfortable, safe and free.</font>

330
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,650
<font color="yellow">That's what it stands for.</font>

331
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,350
<font color="yellow">You look gorgeous.</font>

332
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,880
<font color="yellow">You look amazing.</font>

333
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,650
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

334
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,250
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going? Sleep on the sofa.</font>

335
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
<font color="yellow">- Sofa?
-  Yes.</font>

336
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,620
<font color="yellow">I think you need to explain logically...</font>

337
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,450
<font color="yellow">why I should sleep on the sofa.</font>

338
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,780
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to kick you out?</font>

339
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,880
<font color="yellow">You said you needed a place to sleep and you're trying to hit on me?</font>

340
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,020
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

341
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,120
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

342
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

343
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,150
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

344
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,370
<font color="yellow">I don't believe it.</font>

345
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,850
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

346
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,350
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

347
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,780
<font color="yellow">You're dangerous.</font>

348
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,520
<font color="yellow">You should've told me.</font>

349
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
<font color="yellow">I had no idea.</font>

350
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,940
<font color="yellow">If you wake up at night...</font>

351
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,460
<font color="yellow">to get water or go to the bathroom,</font>

352
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,310
<font color="yellow">I'll be right here.</font>

353
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,210
<font color="yellow">Don't come and stare at my face...</font>

354
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,450
<font color="yellow">or grab my hand.</font>

355
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,520
<font color="yellow">Don't try anything silly.</font>

356
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,620
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

357
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,650
<font color="yellow">You sneaky girl.</font>

358
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,420
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

359
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,420
<font color="yellow">It's cooler on the floor in the summer.</font>

360
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,520
<font color="yellow">If the bed gets too hot,</font>

361
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,180
<font color="yellow">try sleeping on the floor. It's nice and cool.</font>

362
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,580
<font color="yellow">It's so cool.</font>

363
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sleepy. Good night.</font>

364
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,420
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

365
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,080
<font color="yellow">Even that last thing he has will be destroyed...</font>

366
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,650
<font color="yellow">by your bad luck.</font>

367
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,920
<font color="yellow">That isn't true.</font>

368
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,550
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping?</font>

369
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,850
<font color="yellow">You must be sleeping.</font>

370
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,050
<font color="yellow">Thank you for letting me stay here.</font>

371
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,820
<font color="yellow">Sleep tight.</font>

372
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,750
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

373
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,950
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui...</font>

374
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,150
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

375
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,550
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

376
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,550
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

377
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,420
<font color="yellow">- I slept amazingly well.
-  Me, too.</font>

378
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,280
<font color="yellow">It's even better seeing you in the morning. Do you want coffee?</font>

379
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,620
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

380
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,680
<font color="yellow">You should go in.</font>

381
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,850
<font color="yellow">Should I walk you to work?</font>

382
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,420
<font color="yellow">- Go in and look for a place.
-  Gosh!</font>

383
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,010
<font color="yellow">Get plenty of rest here since you worked hard until now.</font>

384
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,280
<font color="yellow">Take a nap and try to be lazy.</font>

385
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,850
<font color="yellow">Come straight home after work.</font>

386
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wait here like a puppy.</font>

387
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,050
<font color="yellow">- See you after work.
-  Wait!</font>

388
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,280
<font color="yellow">I forgot something.</font>

389
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,570
<font color="yellow">I have my salt and red beans.</font>

390
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,650
<font color="yellow">- You have to take this.
-  What?</font>

391
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,350
<font color="yellow">Be safe.</font>

392
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,080
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

393
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,680
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

394
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,880
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

395
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,780
<font color="yellow">Is it okay for us to continue developing IF?</font>

396
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,050
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

397
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,220
<font color="yellow">Even if it's released again, nobody would care about it.</font>

398
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,850
<font color="yellow">But still, Mr Je protected it with everything he had.</font>

399
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,480
<font color="yellow">So we have to make it well.</font>

400
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,250
<font color="yellow">Is Mr Je all right?</font>

401
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,580
<font color="yellow">You can't dump him because he's dirt poor now.</font>

402
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,050
<font color="yellow">The most miserable moment for guys is...</font>

403
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,920
<font color="yellow">getting dumped for not having anything.</font>

404
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,180
<font color="yellow">That's such an immature thing to say!</font>

405
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,980
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about him.</font>

406
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,750
<font color="yellow">That's the only way they can express how much they like Mr Je.</font>

407
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,530
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will tell him that.</font>

408
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,720
<font color="yellow">Don't tell him that I called him dirt poor.</font>

409
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,720
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

410
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,550
<font color="yellow">I am well.</font>

411
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,670
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I'm cleaning,</font>

412
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,450
<font color="yellow">- and I'm washing the dishes.
-  You don't have to do that.</font>

413
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,550
<font color="yellow">You could just leave them.</font>

414
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,320
<font color="yellow">Except that I don't have you here, I am doing perfectly fine.</font>

415
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,750
<font color="yellow">So don't worry about me and work hard. That's why I called.</font>

416
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,420
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
-  All right.</font>

417
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,850
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

418
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,330
<font color="yellow">I wish you'd tell me when you're here.</font>

419
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,650
<font color="yellow">I'm here!</font>

420
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,880
<font color="yellow">You're so excited.</font>

421
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,040
<font color="yellow">This place is empty anyway.</font>

422
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,900
<font color="yellow">So I made a deal with the landlord and rented it for a month.</font>

423
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,750
<font color="yellow">By the way, what is this mouldy office?</font>

424
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,920
<font color="yellow">It used to be Mr Won's office.</font>

425
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,650
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

426
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,420
<font color="yellow">Stake out? Are you planning to catch him yourself?</font>

427
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,120
<font color="yellow">I'm going to destroy the ransomware.</font>

428
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,470
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Let's make a recovery software...</font>

429
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,480
<font color="yellow">and distribute it for free.</font>

430
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,440
<font color="yellow">We can't do anything about the damage that's already been done,</font>

431
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,430
<font color="yellow">but it will start bringing up Zeze Factory's image.</font>

432
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,060
<font color="yellow">Is that possible?</font>

433
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,240
<font color="yellow">You should've mentioned it at the shareholders' meeting.</font>

434
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,150
<font color="yellow">No, I couldn't have done it in the two days they had given me.</font>

435
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
<font color="yellow">And I can't do it by myself.</font>

436
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
<font color="yellow">Are you thinking of working with me?</font>

437
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,320
<font color="yellow">I'm not good at this.</font>

438
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,480
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's Mr Won!</font>

439
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,950
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je.
-  Hello.</font>

440
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,910
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Did you order fried chicken?</font>

441
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,520
<font color="yellow">I forgot.</font>

442
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,590
<font color="yellow">- I should've brought some.
-  Don't worry about it.</font>

443
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,780
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming.</font>

444
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,950
<font color="yellow">Thank you for calling me.</font>

445
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,400
<font color="yellow">What should I do first?</font>

446
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,520
<font color="yellow">What are you here for?</font>

447
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,350
<font color="yellow">They made it possible to check real-time.</font>

448
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,030
<font color="yellow">I don't think we should touch this.</font>

449
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,990
<font color="yellow">Gosh, they twisted it so much.</font>

450
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,610
<font color="yellow">Knots are easy to make but tough to untie.</font>

451
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,150
<font color="yellow">Let's eat!</font>

452
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,350
<font color="yellow">Have some of this.</font>

453
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,920
<font color="yellow">This type is not supposed to have a code, but this one does.</font>

454
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,630
<font color="yellow">They changed an existing ransomware.</font>

455
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,150
<font color="yellow">I think we can fix it.</font>

456
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,050
<font color="yellow">You two are alike.</font>

457
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,030
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
-  Blood-related families...</font>

458
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,550
<font color="yellow">are not the only ones that can look alike.</font>

459
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,220
<font color="yellow">You guys lack imagination.</font>

460
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,280
<font color="yellow">By the way, you are still very good.</font>

461
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,020
<font color="yellow">I just followed your direction.</font>

462
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,980
<font color="yellow">This is fun.</font>

463
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,410
<font color="yellow">It's looking good.</font>

464
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,050
<font color="yellow">You're going to create something amazing!</font>

465
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,180
<font color="yellow">Let me remind you again.</font>

466
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,250
<font color="yellow">This is a top secret. Please don't tell anyone.</font>

467
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,350
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

468
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,220
<font color="yellow">There's no one to tell anyway.</font>

469
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,850
<font color="yellow">Still.</font>

470
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,980
<font color="yellow">- Secret.
-  Secret.</font>

471
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,850
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

472
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,480
<font color="yellow">You naughty boy.</font>

473
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,880
<font color="yellow">Are you happy that you're staying at Bo Nui's?</font>

474
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,950
<font color="yellow">Good? It's amazing.</font>

475
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,290
<font color="yellow">You've opened up your eyes.</font>

476
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,520
<font color="yellow">Your brake is broken. You'll get into an accident!</font>

477
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,830
<font color="yellow">I have to stay there.</font>

478
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,650
<font color="yellow">Of course. Your body and soul must be there.</font>

479
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,350
<font color="yellow">I need to show her that it's okay for us to be together.</font>

480
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,380
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

481
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,350
<font color="yellow">She's scared.</font>

482
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,650
<font color="yellow">She must be really worried right now.</font>

483
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,820
<font color="yellow">I need to stick close to her...</font>

484
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,180
<font color="yellow">and show her that everything will be all right.</font>

485
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,550
<font color="yellow">Wait. So you moved into her house...</font>

486
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,130
<font color="yellow">just to comfort her?</font>

487
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,550
<font color="yellow">Why? Why is Bo Nui so nervous?</font>

488
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,220
<font color="yellow">She's going to think that everything is her fault.</font>

489
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,720
<font color="yellow">If she blames everything that happened to...</font>

490
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
<font color="yellow">me and the company on herself,</font>

491
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,550
<font color="yellow">that fainthearted girl will leave me.</font>

492
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,020
<font color="yellow">Is that why you made sure we never talk about Mr Won?</font>

493
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,250
<font color="yellow">Once she finds out that the person she introduced made this happen...</font>

494
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,010
<font color="yellow">Yes. So that's how it affects her.</font>

495
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,210
<font color="yellow">If it hadn't been for her,</font>

496
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,790
<font color="yellow">Mr Won wouldn't have worked for Zeze Factory.</font>

497
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,490
<font color="yellow">I am going to figure out and fix everything.</font>

498
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,380
<font color="yellow">Then I'm going to tell her that it was nothing.</font>

499
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,920
<font color="yellow">I won't lose her.</font>

500
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,390
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

501
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,550
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

502
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,520
<font color="yellow">What is love?</font>

503
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
<font color="yellow">Love?</font>

504
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,370
<font color="yellow">It's something very precious,</font>

505
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,620
<font color="yellow">happy and ardent.</font>

506
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,050
<font color="yellow">It's a little terrifying, too. Isn't that what it is?</font>

507
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,850
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

508
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,120
<font color="yellow">- You're really in love, aren't you?
-  Yes.</font>

509
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,720
<font color="yellow">Never lose him.</font>

510
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,050
<font color="yellow">Okay. Never.</font>

511
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,620
<font color="yellow">I want to experience that kind of love before I die.</font>

512
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,020
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

513
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,580
<font color="yellow">I'm not attracted to the most handsome man on earth right now.</font>

514
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,250
<font color="yellow">I want him to look cheesier.</font>

515
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,080
<font color="yellow">What's happening to me?</font>

516
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,480
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my eyes?</font>

517
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,580
<font color="yellow">Don't do this to me! Don't!</font>

518
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,680
<font color="yellow">He's ugly.</font>

519
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,220
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

520
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
<font color="yellow">Did you eat?</font>

521
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,850
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

522
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,390
<font color="yellow">You look so cheesy.</font>

523
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,470
<font color="yellow">Why did I ask her that?</font>

524
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,780
<font color="yellow">I am such an idiot. Why did I have to say that?</font>

525
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,550
<font color="yellow">That was so not right.</font>

526
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,550
<font color="yellow">I should've said it like this.</font>

527
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,890
<font color="yellow">Is this an ordinary date?</font>

528
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,050
<font color="yellow">I love it.</font>

529
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
<font color="yellow">I will come pick you up every day.</font>

530
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,050
<font color="yellow">- Bo Nui.
-  Yes?</font>

531
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,680
<font color="yellow">You will continue to hold my hands after a month,</font>

532
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,820
<font color="yellow">after two months...</font>

533
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,620
<font color="yellow">and even after a year, right?</font>

534
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,150
<font color="yellow">You promised me.</font>

535
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,620
<font color="yellow">You don't need to wet it first.</font>

536
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,980
<font color="yellow">It's better this way.</font>

537
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
<font color="yellow">We look so stupid.</font>

538
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,280
<font color="yellow">There's something I desperately want to believe.</font>

539
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,340
<font color="yellow">Who's the sharpest?</font>

540
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,520
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

541
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,350
<font color="yellow">I want to believe his words.</font>

542
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,420
<font color="yellow">I want to believe his eyes.</font>

543
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,670
<font color="yellow">This station is picture frame.</font>

544
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,390
<font color="yellow">I want to believe the time I spend with him.</font>

545
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,350
<font color="yellow">My back hurts.</font>

546
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,650
<font color="yellow">I want to believe...</font>

547
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
<font color="yellow">that it's going to be...</font>

548
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,650
<font color="yellow">okay.</font>

549
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,050
<font color="yellow">(She has a hard time swallowing food.)</font>

550
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,120
<font color="yellow">(I hope every day will be like today.)</font>

551
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,980
<font color="yellow">I hope every day will be like today.</font>

552
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,450
<font color="yellow">Over here.</font>

553
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,790
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late? Bo Nui lives right across the street.</font>

554
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,550
<font color="yellow">You know how absentminded I am nowadays.</font>

555
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,220
<font color="yellow">You look good.</font>

556
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,480
<font color="yellow">Do I?</font>

557
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,390
<font color="yellow">You look comfortable.</font>

558
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,920
<font color="yellow">Start with IM Sports. What happened?</font>

559
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,250
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

560
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,950
<font color="yellow">I was knocked out.</font>

561
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,750
<font color="yellow">I got defeated.</font>

562
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,080
<font color="yellow">So I'm saying goodbye to IM Sports.</font>

563
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,750
<font color="yellow">You must've pushed too hard. You shouldn't have.</font>

564
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,520
<font color="yellow">This is something Zeze has to handle.</font>

565
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,550
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to suffer a loss.</font>

566
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,720
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You're being so nice.</font>

567
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,440
<font color="yellow">Are you just pretending to be worried?</font>

568
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,980
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. I can tell it's fake.</font>

569
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,480
<font color="yellow">- Can you tell?
-  Yes.</font>

570
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,150
<font color="yellow">- Do you think this is funny?
-  Yes, I do.</font>

571
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,720
<font color="yellow">You see me laughing.</font>

572
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,150
<font color="yellow">I can tell we're finally back to being friends.</font>

573
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,450
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

574
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,080
<font color="yellow">I need to ask you something.</font>

575
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,720
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho.</font>

576
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,850
<font color="yellow">Did you hear?</font>

577
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,650
<font color="yellow">Park Ha Sang was behind all this.</font>

578
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,210
<font color="yellow">They are searching for him and everything.</font>

579
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,000
<font color="yellow">It's a disaster.</font>

580
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,300
<font color="yellow">- Is the Russian company behind him?
-  Yes.</font>

581
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,580
<font color="yellow">No wonder why they brought up developing virtual reality games.</font>

582
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,600
<font color="yellow">They're developing something that has a similar concept to ours.</font>

583
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,650
<font color="yellow">Those scumbags.</font>

584
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,450
<font color="yellow">They couldn't steal our game, so they ruined ours.</font>

585
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,020
<font color="yellow">Do you know who that is?</font>

586
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,810
<font color="yellow">He's the one who made you wear that rabbit costume.</font>

587
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,890
<font color="yellow">Those sneaky jerks.</font>

588
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,750
<font color="yellow">- The one who stole Genius?
-  Yes.</font>

589
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,320
<font color="yellow">I don't believe he did it again.</font>

590
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,500
<font color="yellow">How did Park Ha Sang even get in here?</font>

591
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,370
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have the access, and we all know what he looks like.</font>

592
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,260
<font color="yellow">- You won't believe this!
-  What?</font>

593
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,750
<font color="yellow">A restoration file for the ransomware was posted.</font>

594
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,210
<font color="yellow">From where?</font>

595
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,750
<font color="yellow">It's an anonymous user, but it's for free.</font>

596
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,920
<font color="yellow">You just have to download it to restore most of your files.</font>

597
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,750
<font color="yellow">- This is probably a lie.
-  No, it isn't.</font>

598
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,750
<font color="yellow">Can I test it out?</font>

599
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,780
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

600
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,310
<font color="yellow">It's working.</font>

601
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,720
<font color="yellow">- It's real.
-  It works.</font>

602
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
<font color="yellow">It's working.</font>

603
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,720
<font color="yellow">Good job. We made it.</font>

604
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,920
<font color="yellow">- Thank you so much.
-  You're welcome.</font>

605
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,820
<font color="yellow">This looks nice.</font>

606
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,690
<font color="yellow">I told them.</font>

607
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,370
<font color="yellow">Your father...</font>

608
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,320
<font color="yellow">comes to the restaurant to get a drink from time to time.</font>

609
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,820
<font color="yellow">He only drinks soda nowadays.</font>

610
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,020
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

611
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:40,210
<font color="yellow">He asked Yeong Il about how you're doing.</font>

612
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,650
<font color="yellow">Then he pushed me to come here.</font>

613
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,980
<font color="yellow">I'll give you two some time to talk.</font>

614
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,620
<font color="yellow">- Take this.
-  What is it?</font>

615
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
<font color="yellow">Your money.</font>

616
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,540
<font color="yellow">Every time I came to see you,</font>

617
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,750
<font color="yellow">you gave me money with your love.</font>

618
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,550
<font color="yellow">I didn't spend any of it and saved it all.</font>

619
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,820
<font color="yellow">I was planning to use it for your wedding.</font>

620
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,480
<font color="yellow">I don't need it.</font>

621
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,750
<font color="yellow">Your father wanted me to give this to you.</font>

622
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,950
<font color="yellow">It's the register of our fishery.</font>

623
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,890
<font color="yellow">He put it up for sale, so you can spend it when it's sold.</font>

624
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,180
<font color="yellow">Take it back.</font>

625
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,550
<font color="yellow">Please accept it.</font>

626
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,320
<font color="yellow">We've done nothing for you.</font>

627
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,820
<font color="yellow">Either when you were here or in the States,</font>

628
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,550
<font color="yellow">we never did anything for you.</font>

629
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,120
<font color="yellow">Please accept it, Soo Ho.</font>

630
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,050
<font color="yellow">I really don't need it.</font>

631
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,080
<font color="yellow">Don't sell the fishery.</font>

632
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,650
<font color="yellow">You have to tell us when you need anything.</font>

633
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,020
<font color="yellow">I'll do that.</font>

634
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,850
<font color="yellow">Well, then...</font>

635
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,120
<font color="yellow">At least, give this to Bo Nui.</font>

636
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,630
<font color="yellow">The delicate and sweet Bo Nui...</font>

637
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,020
<font color="yellow">needs something to protect her, so I got a tiger for her.</font>

638
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,720
<font color="yellow">Wait! You're a tiger.</font>

639
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,820
<font color="yellow">No wonder why you two make such a perfect couple.</font>

640
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,080
<font color="yellow">Should you get married in the fall?</font>

641
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,270
<font color="yellow">We can go to the fortune-teller to see how compatible you are.</font>

642
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,480
<font color="yellow">- Mum.
-  I hear you.</font>

643
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,320
<font color="yellow">Do you know how good he is?</font>

644
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,680
<font color="yellow">He predicted that an evil raccoon was after you.</font>

645
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,310
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

646
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,960
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
-  Hi.</font>

647
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,750
<font color="yellow">I'm here to say goodbye.</font>

648
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,400
<font color="yellow">I'm moving out today.</font>

649
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,520
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  What?</font>

650
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

651
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,920
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. We should thank you.</font>

652
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,180
<font color="yellow">Even if you go to Canada, we'll annoy you for developing IF.</font>

653
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,020
<font color="yellow">This is my last day in IM Sports.</font>

654
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,080
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Why is that?</font>

655
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,120
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you get fired?</font>

656
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,580
<font color="yellow">It was half my idea. I need a break.</font>

657
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,120
<font color="yellow">Do you have a place to stay in Korea?</font>

658
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,350
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about it.</font>

659
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,750
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

660
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,250
<font color="yellow">Should I move into Saetbyeol Apartment?</font>

661
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,350
<font color="yellow">It was a joke.</font>

662
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,920
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

663
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,880
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for everything.</font>

664
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,370
<font color="yellow">I knew it, but I tried to ignore...</font>

665
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,750
<font color="yellow">the fact that Soo Ho might find someone other than me.</font>

666
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,020
<font color="yellow">I think that's why I was so mean to you.</font>

667
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,910
<font color="yellow">I recently met Soo Ho.</font>

668
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,320
<font color="yellow">My dad asked me to.</font>

669
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,080
<font color="yellow">He asked me to bring Soo Ho with me to the States.</font>

670
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,650
<font color="yellow">He wants to wrap up his 10-year-old research.</font>

671
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,720
<font color="yellow">Guess what Soo Ho said.</font>

672
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,380
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

673
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,780
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

674
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,680
<font color="yellow">I like being with Bo Nui.</font>

675
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,680
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho...</font>

676
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,580
<font color="yellow">looks very happy.</font>

677
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,020
<font color="yellow">You're the one who brings him that happiness.</font>

678
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,220
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

679
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,450
<font color="yellow">I want you to be happy...</font>

680
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,420
<font color="yellow">with him.</font>

681
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,550
<font color="yellow">I always thought you're cool.</font>

682
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,050
<font color="yellow">You're bright, bubbly and confident.</font>

683
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,050
<font color="yellow">You're pretty enough...</font>

684
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,720
<font color="yellow">to be loved by everyone.</font>

685
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,150
<font color="yellow">I was jealous.</font>

686
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,120
<font color="yellow">The person I'm most jealous of...</font>

687
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,950
<font color="yellow">is telling me she's jealous of me.</font>

688
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:01,880
<font color="yellow">Do you want to switch?</font>

689
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,980
<font color="yellow">It's a joke.</font>

690
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:21,680
<font color="yellow">Nurse Lee.</font>

691
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,220
<font color="yellow">- Is something wrong?
-  Congratulations, Bo Nui!</font>

692
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,650
<font color="yellow">I didn't know this day would come.</font>

693
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,150
<font color="yellow">It's okay now. She's fine now.</font>

694
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,380
<font color="yellow">(Contacts)</font>

695
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,450
<font color="yellow">(Mr Je)</font>

696
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,680
<font color="yellow">(Mr Je)</font>

697
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,450
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

698
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,920
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra.</font>

699
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,320
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

700
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,420
<font color="yellow">Finally.</font>

701
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,780
<font color="yellow">Everything is okay now.</font>

702
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,080
<font color="yellow">- Bo Nui.
-  Things will be better now.</font>

703
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,120
<font color="yellow">Let's recover slowly and live together.</font>

704
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:16,880
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Bo Ra.</font>

705
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,480
<font color="yellow">The curse may have been lifted.</font>

706
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,520
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra and Mr Je.</font>

707
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,180
<font color="yellow">Everyone may be fine now.</font>

708
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,150
<font color="yellow">Please feel free to take this if you need it.</font>

709
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,450
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

710
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,220
<font color="yellow">I'm so proud of you, Bo Nui.</font>

711
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,280
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

712
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,680
<font color="yellow">- I'm so proud.
-  Mr Je.</font>

713
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,720
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra...</font>

714
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:37,950
<font color="yellow">can talk now.</font>

715
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:42,450
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

716
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,180
<font color="yellow">She can only say my name so far, but what matters is...</font>

717
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,380
<font color="yellow">that she started talking.</font>

718
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,220
<font color="yellow">She recovered her voice.</font>

719
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,900
<font color="yellow">Shall we go see her now then? Wait, it's late.</font>

720
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,980
<font color="yellow">Shall we go tomorrow morning?</font>

721
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,720
<font color="yellow">- I saw her.
-  Already?</font>

722
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,750
<font color="yellow">Without your talisman?</font>

723
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,120
<font color="yellow">Is today a special day or what?</font>

724
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,450
<font color="yellow">Are you being reborn today?</font>

725
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,650
<font color="yellow">Tell me that it's okay.</font>

726
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,750
<font color="yellow">Say that it'll be okay and that everything will be fine.</font>

727
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,220
<font color="yellow">It'll be fine.</font>

728
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,320
<font color="yellow">Everything will be fine no matter what.</font>

729
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,180
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow is the seventh day.</font>

730
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,820
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to kick me out?</font>

731
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,450
<font color="yellow">You can't live like this forever.</font>

732
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,620
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

733
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,220
<font color="yellow">If that's the case...</font>

734
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,480
<font color="yellow">Let's go on a date tomorrow.</font>

735
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,220
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

736
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,750
<font color="yellow">- It's so pretty.
-  Yes, indeed.</font>

737
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,280
<font color="yellow">You'll have to dress up since it'll be a special date.</font>

738
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,950
<font color="yellow">You know that I like hearing yes, right?</font>

739
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,680
<font color="yellow">"Yes, yes." Like this.</font>

740
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,180
<font color="yellow">Well, what I mean is...</font>

741
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,550
<font color="yellow">When I say that we should eat, drink...</font>

742
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,950
<font color="yellow">or do something,</font>

743
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,650
<font color="yellow">you should just say yes.</font>

744
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,820
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm sleepy.</font>

745
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,780
<font color="yellow">I should get some sleep.</font>

746
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,480
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

747
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,780
<font color="yellow">he's going to propose to you!</font>

748
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,780
<font color="yellow">He asked you out on a date and gave you that dress.</font>

749
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,920
<font color="yellow">He told you to say yes no matter what!</font>

750
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,820
<font color="yellow">Today is the day.</font>

751
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,020
<font color="yellow">I knew it. I was thinking you look prettier than usual today.</font>

752
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,920
<font color="yellow">Mr Je is so good at dating.</font>

753
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,060
<font color="yellow">I don't have to teach him anything.</font>

754
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,120
<font color="yellow">I guess it's because he's a genius.</font>

755
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,880
<font color="yellow">Sure thing.</font>

756
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,120
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim.</font>

757
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,550
<font color="yellow">I should be...</font>

758
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,750
<font color="yellow">allowed to be happy now, right?</font>

759
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,420
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

760
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,020
<font color="yellow">You must be happy.</font>

761
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,450
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this feels so nice.</font>

762
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,980
<font color="yellow">Do women like pink flowers?</font>

763
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,050
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  I'll get this then.</font>

764
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,050
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

765
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,260
<font color="yellow">Mr Won, where have you been?</font>

766
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,120
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, please come here now.</font>

767
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,980
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui. Bo Nui!</font>

768
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,650
<font color="yellow">You let the suspect in just before the incident took place...</font>

769
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,980
<font color="yellow">and resigned without giving notice after the incident.</font>

770
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:36,080
<font color="yellow">The circumstances tell me that you must be his accomplice.</font>

771
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,480
<font color="yellow">Tell me. How much did he give you?</font>

772
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,830
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about now?</font>

773
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,990
<font color="yellow">He just gave me a few drinks and coffee. Is that considered bribery?</font>

774
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:47,310
<font color="yellow">Then tell me why you let him in when you aren't even his accomplice.</font>

775
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,210
<font color="yellow">He said he was doing an electrical inspection.</font>

776
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,640
<font color="yellow">According to the security camera footage,</font>

777
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,580
<font color="yellow">it looked like you left him alone on purpose.</font>

778
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,960
<font color="yellow">Was I supposed to poop there then?</font>

779
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,620
<font color="yellow">I ran to the washroom because I had diarrhoea.</font>

780
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,080
<font color="yellow">That's when he installed the ransomware or whatever it is.</font>

781
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,650
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

782
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,320
<font color="yellow">He came to work on some electrical work.</font>

783
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,140
<font color="yellow">Then why did you run away?</font>

784
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,020
<font color="yellow">It must've been because of guilt!</font>

785
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,520
<font color="yellow">I wanted to catch him myself.</font>

786
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,240
<font color="yellow">I've been on a stake-out all this time.</font>

787
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,450
<font color="yellow">I could've caught him by now if it weren't for you.</font>

788
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,480
<font color="yellow">I should go catch him right now...</font>

789
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,420
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

790
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,000
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, tell him. I have no idea what that thing is.</font>

791
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,780
<font color="yellow">You know that I'd never do such a thing.</font>

792
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,480
<font color="yellow">Is the guy...</font>

793
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,320
<font color="yellow">from that day the suspect?</font>

794
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,590
<font color="yellow">I really didn't know.</font>

795
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:41,150
<font color="yellow">Did you let him into the office?</font>

796
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

797
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,680
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

798
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,780
<font color="yellow">It's not my fault.</font>

799
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,250
<font color="yellow">It's not because of me.</font>

800
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,650
<font color="yellow">I just started believing that...</font>

801
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:59,720
<font color="yellow">the unfortunate incidents...</font>

802
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,750
<font color="yellow">happened by pure coincidence.</font>

803
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,920
<font color="yellow">But if it was you...</font>

804
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,450
<font color="yellow">What can I do if it was you?</font>

805
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,120
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

806
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,580
<font color="yellow">How can you be like this?</font>

807
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,280
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, what's wrong?</font>

808
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,280
<font color="yellow">You said you ruined Mr Won Dae Hae's life.</font>

809
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:51,750
<font color="yellow">He got a really good job recently.</font>

810
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,420
<font color="yellow">You said you're cursed with bad luck, but good things are happening.</font>

811
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,620
<font color="yellow">I ran to see Mr Koo as soon as I heard the news.</font>

812
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,680
<font color="yellow">He's saying it's the racoon.</font>

813
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,380
<font color="yellow">The racoon got involved.</font>

814
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,750
<font color="yellow">What a sad and wretched fate!</font>

815
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,980
<font color="yellow">I see a deadly knife.</font>

816
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,420
<font color="yellow">Its blade is thrusted in you.</font>

817
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,420
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

818
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,020
<font color="yellow">Your ferocious energy...</font>

819
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,720
<font color="yellow">makes people suffer and bleed.</font>

820
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,320
<font color="yellow">Who would want to be around you?</font>

821
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,270
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  Don't blame anybody!</font>

822
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,520
<font color="yellow">It's all because of you.</font>

823
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,280
<font color="yellow">It's not true.</font>

824
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,300
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

825
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,970
<font color="yellow">Ms Shim... Shim Bo Nui.</font>

826
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:50,150
<font color="yellow">No, I should just call her Bo Nui.</font>

827
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,650
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

828
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,080
<font color="yellow">Ta-da! This is for you!</font>

829
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,450
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, where are you now?</font>

830
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,250
<font color="yellow">Hello? Bo Nui?</font>

831
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,880
<font color="yellow">Mr Je.</font>

832
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,350
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

833
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,480
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

834
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,150
<font color="yellow">I miss you so much.</font>

835
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,220
<font color="yellow">Tell me...</font>

836
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,280
<font color="yellow">that it's not true.</font>

837
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,350
<font color="yellow">Tell me that it's okay.</font>

838
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,580
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

839
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:02,580
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui!</font>

840
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's not true.</font>

841
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,420
<font color="yellow">Look at him smiling like that.</font>

842
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,080
<font color="yellow">If he is left with nothing but his body...</font>

843
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,220
<font color="yellow">Even that last thing he has will be destroyed...</font>

844
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,720
<font color="yellow">- by your bad luck.
-  No.</font>

845
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

846
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,220
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

847
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:20,180
<font color="yellow">(He)</font>

848
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:28,180
<font color="yellow">(Please feel free to take this if you need it!)</font>

849
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,820
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

850
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,550
<font color="yellow">I relied on you in times of distress.</font>

851
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:36,320
<font color="yellow">But from today,</font>

852
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,220
<font color="yellow">I'm going to lean on him.</font>

853
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,280
<font color="yellow">I'll trust him and lean on his heart.</font>

854
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:44,950
<font color="yellow">I want to live happily like that.</font>

855
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,220
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

856
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,050
<font color="yellow">can do that, right?</font>
