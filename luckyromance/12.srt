00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,820
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to accept me! I won't ask you to do anything either...</font>

64
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,570
<font color="yellow">But! Don't tell me to lie.</font>

68

69
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,810
<font color="yellow">But is your heart the only thing that's important to you? Is that it!?</font>

70
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,810
<font color="yellow">"That person"?</font>

71
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,440

347
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,600

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,040
<font color="yellow">I'll give you coffee for free. Also, this is a secret...</font>

350
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,330
<font color="yellow">But, I'm a major shareholder here.</font>

351
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,960
<font color="yellow">The first major shareholder.</font>

352
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,750
<font color="yellow">You're probably the <i>hateful, distasteful</i> shareholder!</font>

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,870
<font color="yellow">Y-You sound just like someone I know...</font>

<font color="yellow">D-Dal...</font>

355
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,220
<font color="yellow">Y-You're bundle of Dal?!</font>

356
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,880
<font color="yellow">There's no way! Smile!</font>

357
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,630
<font color="yellow">This isn't possible! How did you change so much?!</font>

358
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,640
<font color="yellow">You told me to.</font>

359
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,900
<font color="yellow">What do I do!? I'm embarrassed! I hit on...that bundle of Dal!</font>

360
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,050
<font color="yellow">I've dishonored my family! This is embarrassing!</font>

00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,830

363
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,790
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty!</font>

364
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,080
<font color="yellow">I was clinging to Ms. Seung Hyeon for no reason!</font>

365
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,180
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim, take a picture with me in a bit! I'll get 1000 likes no matter what!</font>

366
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,880
<font color="yellow">Still, the best in our team is Ms. Seung Hyeon!</font>

367
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,970
<font color="yellow">Making lines of people, is wrong!</font>

369
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,120

370
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,500

376
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,390
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you!?</font>

377
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,290
<font color="yellow">Just a bit anemic...</font>

378
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,060
<font color="yellow">The...When will the beta be out?</font>

379
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,850
<font color="yellow">Oh yes! We're planning on starting distributions next week.</font>

380
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,020

382
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,540

383
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,220
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah...</font>

384
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,600

<font color="yellow">Really?!</font>

388
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,140
<font color="yellow">That's so good! You did great Sim Bo Nui!</font>

389
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,480
<font color="yellow">That's right, by what means would you block the breeze in your heart!</font>

390
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,670
<font color="yellow">- It's probably okay, right?<br>- Of course it is!</font>

391
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,110
<font color="yellow">We could double-date!</font>

392
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,140
<font color="yellow">Double-date?</font>

393
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,350
<font color="yellow">I think it's working out well for me these days.</font>

396
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,730
<font color="yellow">- Don't be shocked.<br>- What's there to be shocked about!</font>

<font color="yellow">The CEO!?</font>

399
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,440
<font color="yellow">You...You said it was because of the divinatory sign...that nothing happened!</font>

400
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,180
<font color="yellow">The truth is...I wanted to hold him from the beginning.</font>

401
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,350
<font color="yellow">Strangely enough, I guess I thought it would be okay to hold his hand.</font>

402
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,320
<font color="yellow">Oh! What about you?! Who is it? Is it someone from work?</font>

403

409
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,090

<font color="yellow">Damn, man move!</font>

417
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,790
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with me? I've gone crazy...</font>

418
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,230
<font color="yellow">Okay, number 2, here we go!</font>

419
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,880
<font color="yellow">Ms. Sim Bo Nui, congratulations! You've been chosen!</font>

420
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,250
<font color="yellow">What! Why's it always me?</font>

421
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,390
<font color="yellow">Excuse...What...Is it about lunch?</font>

422
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,060

423
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,770
<font color="yellow">These people are asking for trouble!</font>

424
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,880
<font color="yellow">You don't even remember the CEO's lunch!</font>

425
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,970
<font color="yellow">And you just do "dalalala" by yourselves!</font>

426
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,200
<font color="yellow">Oh...CEO, were you going to eat with us?</font>

427
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,310
<font color="yellow">I have to eat!</font>

428
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,130
<font color="yellow">Pick something from bread, rice cakes, and noodles. I'll buy.</font>

429
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,740
<font color="yellow"><i>- Bread?<br>- B-Black bean noodles...</i></font>

<font color="yellow">It's done. Enjoy.</font>

434
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,860

436
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,990
<font color="yellow">- Wow, it's really been a while!<br>- What's wrong with him, buying us pizza!</font>

437
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,760
<font color="yellow">W-Why...Why's she coming?</font>

438
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,020
<font color="yellow">I told her I ate already and she keeps...Yes, come in!</font>

439
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,780
<font color="yellow">CEO, please eat this!</font>

440
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,110
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to die because I wanted to hug you so bad.</font>

441
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,370
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

442
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,890
<font color="yellow">Just one minute!</font>

443
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,000
<font color="yellow">- Eat this first!<br>- Dun wanna!</font>

444
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,920
<font color="yellow">From now on, eat all your meals and have good nights of sleep, okay?</font>

445
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,950
<font color="yellow">If you give me a kiss!</font>

446

449
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:16,460
<font color="yellow">This one, I talked about this to you yesterday but you see how the sun is over here and the shadow's on this side?</font>

450
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,520
<font color="yellow"><i>The shadow being over here covers up the details.</i></font>

451
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,630
<font color="yellow"><i>I'd like it if you could move the shadow over to this side.</i></font>

<font color="yellow">♬<i> One day, you came to me and showed me your heart</i> ♬</font>

453
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,550
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ji Hoon! Your phone seems to have shattered the last time I saw it.</font>

454
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,250
<font color="yellow">- My phone?<br>- Yes.</font>

455
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,220
<font color="yellow">Wait just a minute!</font>

456
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,180
<font color="yellow">So cute!</font>

457
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:52,090
<font color="yellow">♬<i> I sent you away without saying a word</i> ♬</font>

458
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,170
<font color="yellow">- CEO!<br>- Yeah.<br>- I tried taking out the people when they mentioned it.</font>

459
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,160
<font color="yellow">- Y...Yes, do it like that.<br><i>- When I put in people, they said it was too cluttered last time.</i></font>

460
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,510
<font color="yellow">Then...I think you can do it like that.</font>

461
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,500
<font color="yellow">Wait, CEO, if we're indecisive about this...</font>

462
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,830
<font color="yellow">Then! How about wearing this and doing it?</font>

463
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,320
<font color="yellow">Alright...</font>

464
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,850
<font color="yellow">- Woo!<br>- Isn't it nice!?<br>- As expected, the best is a party!</font>

465
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:24,850
<font color="yellow"><i>Music should be like this! Why take out the women?! The music should have this feel! CEO, you like this right?!</i></font>

466
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,690
<font color="yellow"><i>You're doing great!</i></font>

467
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,080
<font color="yellow">♬<i> Because I love you more than anyone else</i> ♬</font>

468
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,400
<font color="yellow">We were totally secretive! Right?</font>

469
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,340
<font color="yellow">Mhm. Aside from Dal Nim, I bet no one could tell!</font>

470
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,640
<font color="yellow">I bet Ms. Dal Nim doesn't know either!</font>

471
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Hand it over-all of you, hand it over.</i></font>

472
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,220
<font color="yellow">I mean, you bet on it not being Gary, <i>not</i> that she'd date the CEO!</font>

473
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,620
<font color="yellow">Either way, you bet on Gary!</font>

474
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,240
<font color="yellow">- But how could they be so obvious about it!?<br>- It was really hard pretending I don't know...</font>

475
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,660
<font color="yellow">- I guess they really think we don't know!<br>- No way!</font>

476
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,510
<font color="yellow">Just leave them be! This is probably his first time dating someone!</font>

477
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,550
<font color="yellow">We're not walls!</font>

478
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,810
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim, when did you first find out?</font>

479
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,620
<font color="yellow">I don't know! Don't ask me such things!</font>

480
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:29,730
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim! Wear slippers, you'll sprain your ankle like that!</font>

481
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,080
<font color="yellow">An otaku is only complete...</font>

482
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,620
<font color="yellow">when that person is happy...</font>

483
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,590
<font color="yellow"><i>End.</i></font>

484
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,750
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

485
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,600
<font color="yellow">- What?<br>- We're at the riverbank.</font>

486
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:09,190
<font color="yellow">I hate it! But what can I do, they told me it's the best dating spot.</font>

487
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,510
<font color="yellow">- Did you search online?!<br>- In summary,</font>

488
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,970
<font color="yellow">after organizing 14,000 blog entries, the results are as follows.</font>

489
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:18,480
<font color="yellow">The highest satisfaction rate of dating places was an outside picnic with 33%.</font>

490
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,400
<font color="yellow">The highest satisfaction rate of clothes was blue-layers with 49%.</font>

491
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,770
<font color="yellow">This is a turn-off, isn't it.</font>

492
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,560
<font color="yellow">It's cool.</font>

493
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,210
<font color="yellow">I like the place and your clothes are cool too.</font>

494
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,400
<font color="yellow">This is so nice.</font>

495
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,210
<font color="yellow">CEO, you've never been on a picnic then, have you.</font>

496
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,830
<font color="yellow">I never had an interest for those things.</font>

497
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,310
<font color="yellow">Hey, what kind of child would feel that way?!</font>

498
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,830
<font color="yellow">Even when I was always alone, my heart would race when picnic day came!</font>

499
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,750
<font color="yellow">From now, I'll be responsible for your picnics. And I'll make you lunch too.</font>

500
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,880
<font color="yellow">But...how long are you going keep it up?</font>

501
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,120
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry?</font>

502
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,100
<font color="yellow">I mean...the sun is warm...and the grass is green...</font>

503
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,600
<font color="yellow">but you keep saying "CEO, CEO", so I want to make you do work.</font>

504
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,260
<font color="yellow">I call my CEO "CEO", what else would I call him...</font>

505
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,560
<font color="yellow">I mean, a person has a name but if you keep calling him something about his work,</font>

506
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,550
<font color="yellow">then I wonder if that's the right thing to do, <i>Bo Nui.</i></font>

507
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,250
<font color="yellow">Don't you think? Bo Nui?</font>

508
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,820
<font color="yellow">Are you speaking casually?</font>

509
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,220
<font color="yellow">You do it too, Bo Nui!</font>

510
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,300
<font color="yellow">- Should I? Soo Ho?<br>- That's not right!</font>

511
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,940
<font color="yellow">I'm older than you!</font>

512
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,490
<font color="yellow">Then what do you want me to do?!</font>

513
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,920
<font color="yellow">I mean...use casual speech...</font>

514
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,060
<font color="yellow">But...like "oppa"...</font>

515
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,920
<font color="yellow">Huh? Or..."oppa"...</font>

516
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,970
<font color="yellow">- Oh! That "oppa" word...exists...<br>- I see...</font>

517
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,140
<font color="yellow">Okay Soo Ho!</font>

518
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,540
<font color="yellow">I gave you a good example. Why are you doing this? Don't do that.</font>

519
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,700
<font color="yellow">- Mkay Soo Ho.<br>- You're asking for trouble!</font>

520
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,820
<font color="yellow">- Soo Ho, you're so scary.<br>- If you keep this up, I'll really get upset!</font>

521
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,780
<font color="yellow">Okay Soo Ho.</font>

522
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,990
<font color="yellow">Faster!</font>

523
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:22,340
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you know what the shortest spell in the world is?</i></font>

524
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,020
<font color="yellow"><i>Are we doing this again?</i></font>

525
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:31,690
<font color="yellow"><i>They say it's your name. I hated and was so scared of my name being Sim Bo Nui. It felt like a curse.</i></font>

526
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,220
<font color="yellow"><i>But...</i></font>

527
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,760
<font color="yellow"><i>Hearing it from you, it sounds so nice!</i></font>

528
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,510
<font color="yellow"><i>Bo Nui! Bo Nui.</i></font>

529
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Thanks for being born, Bo Nui.</i></font>

530
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,990
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

531
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,650
<font color="yellow">Gimmie. I'll take it as a celebratory gift.</font>

532
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,430
<font color="yellow">It's not for you.</font>

533
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,410
<font color="yellow">Then who? Ms. Dal Nim? Mr. Ji Hoon...</font>

534
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:07,310
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me it's Gary!? Who're you giving it to, tell me!</font>

535
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,520
<font color="yellow">This has nothing to do with you.</font>

536
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,490
<font color="yellow">It's for my one and only fortuneteller classmate and is a response to her giving me gifts.</font>

537
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:19,440
<font color="yellow">Do you...still stay in touch with my mother?</font>

538
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,220
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard from her since that day. So I'm more worried.</font>

539
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

540
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:31,190
<font color="yellow">What happened that day, it was my fault. All of it.</font>

541
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,110
<font color="yellow">I won't lie to you ever again. I promise.</font>

00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,610
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh! Excuse me, aren't you Gary Choi's GF?!</i></font>

543
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,000
<font color="yellow">- Right?<br>- You must be right!</font>

544
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,330
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, we're totally fans of Gary Choi!</i></font>

545
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,600
<font color="yellow">She's my girlf-my "GF"!</font>

546
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,830
<font color="yellow">Don't you know me? Je Soo Ho? Damn Genius?! Don't you play cellphone games...</font>

547
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,320

548
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,270
<font color="yellow">We're going to fall!</font>

549
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,920
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait!</font>

550
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,790
<font color="yellow">It's okay! It's just as it was!</font>

551
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,220
<font color="yellow">Why'd you jump in there!?</font>

552
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,080
<font color="yellow">Hold...Hold my hand...</font>

553
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,850
<font color="yellow">Shoulder, shoulder...shoulder!</font>

554
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,320
<font color="yellow">Knee, knee! Hurry, hurry!</font>

555
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,630
<font color="yellow">But about that prayer stick, should we give it to her right now?</font>

556
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,270
<font color="yellow">Together?</font>

557
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,360
<font color="yellow">I mean, you keep holding it against yourself...</font>

558
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,790
<font color="yellow">But if I go, I might really fight again. But promise you won't be stressed!</font>

559
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,180
<font color="yellow"><i>The caller cannot come to the phone right now...</i></font>

560
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,990
<font color="yellow">I don't think anyone's home. Even your mother won't pick up.</font>

561
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,240
<font color="yellow">Should we try calling your father?</font>

562
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,180
<font color="yellow">I don't know his number...</font>

563
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,450
<font color="yellow">You're here!</font>

564
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,800
<font color="yellow">Please come in!</font>

565
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,480
<font color="yellow">- Let this go.<br>- You brought this here to give it to me!</font>

566
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,080
<font color="yellow">- Let go!<br>- I can't!</font>

567
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,240
<font color="yellow">Take it then!</font>

568
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:09,630
<font color="yellow">I gave you a mild one. Should I bring a stronger one out?</font>

569
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,810
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you. Aren't you mad?!</font>

570
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

571
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,830
<font color="yellow">People are really cunning.</font>

572
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:35,400
<font color="yellow">They're fine with saying "thank you, sorry" to other people.</font>

573
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,770
<font color="yellow">But when it comes to their family, they won't say a word.</font>

574
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,670
<font color="yellow">You said so last time, that he was your baby.</font>

575
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,850
<font color="yellow">That he was your baby no matter what!</font>

576
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,130
<font color="yellow">How much have you suffered...</font>

577
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,670
<font color="yellow">That man!</font>

578
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:13,230
<font color="yellow">Gary! Aren't you in there!?</font>

579
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,260
<font color="yellow">Are you really not!?</font>

580
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,850
<font color="yellow">Seriously, he's driving me crazy!</font>

581
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,000
<font color="yellow"><i>The caller has powered off his phone. You will be connected to his voice mailbox</i>.</font>

582
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,480
<font color="yellow">Hey! You think it's enough to just send a text saying "getting some air"?!</font>

583
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,910
<font color="yellow">This is getting off the map!</font>

584
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,630
<font color="yellow">As soon as you get this message, call me.</font>

585
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,190
<font color="yellow">Reports are coming in right now!</font>

586
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,490
<font color="yellow">I said let's stay together a little longer!</font>

587
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,570
<font color="yellow">We were together all day!</font>

588
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,900
<font color="yellow">Exactly, we were together all day so we can stay together a little longer!</font>

589
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,020
<font color="yellow">You have to hurry and get ready for your business trip!</font>

590
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,010
<font color="yellow">I don't wanna go.</font>

591
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,460
<font color="yellow">The business trip is 48 hours, if I add that to the time on the airplane...</font>

592
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,190
<font color="yellow">I can't even calculate it. I really can't do it. I'm not going. I can't go on this business trip, I'm gonna call them and tell them i can't go.</font>

593
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,830
<font color="yellow">It'll be over in a moment!</font>

594
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,960
<font color="yellow">I'm going to miss you so much.</font>

595
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,550
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

596
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:37,080
<font color="yellow">But...you know you've never said "I miss you" before?</font>

597
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,760
<font color="yellow">Do I have to say it for you to know it?</font>

598
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,110
<font color="yellow"><i>Soo Ho...</i></font>

599
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,480
<font color="yellow"><i>He was smiling.</i></font>

600
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,450
<font color="yellow">Slowly!</font>

601
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:21,210
<font color="yellow">I'm sayin'! What kind of game is fate playing!?</font>

602
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:24,050
<font color="yellow">So when Gary and I came to Korea,</font>

603
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:28,580
<font color="yellow">we were both utterly rejected by our first love from a decade ago!</font>

604
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:32,170
<font color="yellow">I mean, exactly, you got rejected by someone else, why are you complaining about it to me?</font>

605
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,590
<font color="yellow">- I!<br>- You're grabbing my shirt.</font>

606
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,760
<font color="yellow">- I couldn't even imagine it!<br>- Okay, w-wait...</font>

607
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,760
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho likes a woman...that isn't me...</font>

608
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,410
<font color="yellow">Wait, my shirt...</font>

609
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:47,510
<font color="yellow">I know I go off about saving Soo Ho and stuff like that.</font>

610
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:54,380
<font color="yellow">But he's never opened his heart since then. For 10, no 30 years, he never took a step out of that cave.</font>

611
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,000
<font color="yellow">The one who pulled him out of that cave, is Ms. Bo Nui.</font>

612
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,410
<font color="yellow">Why!? Why! Why!? Why does that have to be Ms. Bo Nui?!</font>

613
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:05,490
<font color="yellow">Why can't it be me!? When I'm so pretty!</font>

614
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,670
<font color="yellow">When I see him next time, I'll be sure to ask why that happened.</font>

615
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,350
<font color="yellow">You have a call.</font>

616
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:11,030
<font color="yellow">Right. I'm sorry.</font>

617
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,520
<font color="yellow">Just a minute.</font>

618
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,180
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ms. Dal Nim, I'm a little busy right now.</font>

619
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,090
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

620
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,460
<font color="yellow">Ms. Dal Nim!</font>

621
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,230
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

622
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,690
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

623
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,780
<font color="yellow">One of them has to die for this to be over...</font>

624
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,730
<font color="yellow">Unnie, this is so unfair to me.</font>

625
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:37,290
<font color="yellow">This hateful detestful guy totally teased me!</font>

626
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,430
<font color="yellow">Why'd you tease this child?!</font>

627
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,020
<font color="yellow">W-When did I do that!?</font>

628
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,650
<font color="yellow">I never did that!</font>

629
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,430
<font color="yellow">I-I mean...But how do I do this?</font>

630
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,200
<font color="yellow">I have to go on a business trip with Je Soo Ho tomorrow!</font>

631
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,090
<font color="yellow"><i>Gimmie, c'mon, hand it over!</i></font>

00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,920
<font color="yellow">Click this. Okay?</font>

635
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,890
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

636
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,820
<font color="yellow">Then you slide and click-there! See?!</font>

637
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,080
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're so fast! As expected of Zeze's ace!</font>

638
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,020
<font color="yellow"><i>If it wasn't for my CEO,</i></font>

639
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,070

640
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,480
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

641
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,570
<font color="yellow">You little-don't play lovey-dovey in front of me!</font>

642
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:22,170
<font color="yellow">I mean...Ms. Bo Nui is a little...she's a little weird.</font>

643
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,800

00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,080

646
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,990
<font color="yellow">My Bo Nui is what?!</font>

647
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:36,240
<font color="yellow">- You little-just because I let you talk!<br>- Wait, wait, you're really drunk!<br>- You stay still!</font>

00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,950
<font color="yellow">My 2 years of one-sided love!</font>

00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,980
<font color="yellow">The one I liked so much, I filled 3 notebooks without space to spare!</font>

652
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:55,950
<font color="yellow">My CEO...I wouldn't have just let him go like that...</font>

653
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:58,090

659
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,840
<font color="yellow">No, my Soo Ho.</font>

660
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,730
<font color="yellow">- Quietly, quietly!<br>- You!</font>

661
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:21,130
<font color="yellow">The crime of talking about my Bo Nui so lightly.</font>

662
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:25,670
<font color="yellow">The crime of hurting my CEO's heart in the past!</font>

725
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,800
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm really going!</i></font>

726
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,950

<font color="yellow">Then IF is going to be a perfect choice.</font>

728

751
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:37,240
<font color="yellow">Hello? CEO?</font>

752
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,700
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you sleep?</i></font>

753
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,960
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

754
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,800

<font color="yellow">From morning to night, all day.</font>

761
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,130
<font color="yellow">I miss you. So much I might die.</font>

762
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:25,440
<font color="yellow"><i>Then...open the door.</i></font>

763
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:28,730
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

764
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,920
<font color="yellow"><i>How long are you going to keep me standing here?</i></font>

765
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:40,820
<font color="yellow">I need to be more patient.</font>

766
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:43,540
<font color="yellow">How!?</font>

767
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,580
<font color="yellow">490,000 multiplied by 365 is 1,007,885 days.</font>

01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,810
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

772
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:19,780

773
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:24,660
<font color="yellow">I finished calculating the time left with you, and it's not nearly enough.</font>

774
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:34,750
<font color="yellow">Then...say it officially.</font>

775
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,360
<font color="yellow">That it's yes.</font>

776

01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,760
<font color="yellow">I said Yes.</font>

780
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,300
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yes.</font>
