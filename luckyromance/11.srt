00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:07,991
<font color="yellow">If you go now,</font>

2
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:09,891
<font color="yellow">I won't ask you ever again.</font>

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,721
<font color="yellow">You really...</font>

4
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:15,961
<font color="yellow">don't like me?</font>

5
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,121
<font color="yellow">You said I'm like a bug.</font>

6
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,291
<font color="yellow">A bug in your head.</font>

7
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:24,591
<font color="yellow">Catch it.</font>

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:26,391
<font color="yellow">Catch it and kill it.</font>

9
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:11,091
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

10
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:15,021
<font color="yellow">what I'm supposed to do?</font>

11
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,321
<font color="yellow">- We shouldn't. - It's okay.</font>

12
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:43,791
<font color="yellow">- I don't want this. - You're lying.</font>

13
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:49,491
<font color="yellow">You told me you don't like me.</font>

14
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:53,121
<font color="yellow">You would've left if you meant that.</font>

15
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,591
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

16
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,691
<font color="yellow">you were crying.</font>

17
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,691
<font color="yellow">That means you're lying.</font>

18
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:04,121
<font color="yellow">Like a fool...</font>

19
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:08,391
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

20
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:11,721
<font color="yellow">I came this far...</font>

21
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:16,521
<font color="yellow">without realising it.</font>

22
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,091
<font color="yellow">I tried to stop my feelings.</font>

23
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:20,821
<font color="yellow">I tried...</font>

24
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:25,661
<font color="yellow">But my heart won't listen to me.</font>

25
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,321
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

26
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,391
<font color="yellow">Let's stop here.</font>

27
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:35,661
<font color="yellow">Why? You can't even hide your feelings from me.</font>

28
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:38,251
<font color="yellow">You end up in tears before you can walk away.</font>

29
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,521
<font color="yellow">I'll like you from afar.</font>

30
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,891
<font color="yellow">I'll yearn for you by myself...</font>

31
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,591
<font color="yellow">and get over it by myself. I can do that.</font>

32
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:46,191
<font color="yellow">You'll end it even before starting anything?</font>

33
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:47,991
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

34
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:50,491
<font color="yellow">for liking me.</font>

35
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:53,551
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

36
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:58,251
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

37
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:00,751
<font color="yellow">If you want me to prove my feelings for you, I'll try.</font>

38
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:02,091
<font color="yellow">If it's because of the superstitions,</font>

39
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:04,921
<font color="yellow">I'll go to a fortune-teller with you.</font>

40
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:06,191
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

41
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:09,051
<font color="yellow">- do anything for me? - Just say it.</font>

42
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:10,451
<font color="yellow">Forget what happened today.</font>

43
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:15,021
<font color="yellow">Everything you said...</font>

44
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:17,691
<font color="yellow">and the kiss.</font>

45
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,051
<font color="yellow">I'll see you...</font>

46
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:25,591
<font color="yellow">at work tomorrow.</font>

47
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:51,721
<font color="yellow">Why is it so complicated?</font>

48
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,421
<font color="yellow">I guess it's possible.</font>

49
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,551
<font color="yellow">I see happiness in front of me.</font>

50
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,491
<font color="yellow">Have I ever pushed forward for my own happiness?</font>

51
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:35,551
<font color="yellow">It's warm.</font>

52
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:37,321
<font color="yellow">I feel secure.</font>

53
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:39,121
<font color="yellow">I feel safe.</font>

54
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:41,021
<font color="yellow">I feel happy.</font>

55
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,461
<font color="yellow">That isn't yours.</font>

56
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,791
<font color="yellow">That happiness isn't meant for you.</font>

57
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:12,151
<font color="yellow">Water!</font>

58
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,651
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

59
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,491
<font color="yellow">It's salted water.</font>

60
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,891
<font color="yellow">You don't deserve to drink water.</font>

61
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,251
<font color="yellow">Don't cross the line.</font>

62
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:41,351
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

63
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:45,291
<font color="yellow">You don't deserve to live with me.</font>

64
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:48,551
<font color="yellow">Don't ever cross that line.</font>

65
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,121
<font color="yellow">Where are all my shoes?</font>

66
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:02,191
<font color="yellow">You don't deserve to wear any shoes.</font>

67
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:03,951
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you've done enough?</font>

68
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:07,421
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

69
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:10,621
<font color="yellow">Isn't fighting with the night guard enough to blow off your steam?</font>

70
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:12,921
<font color="yellow">Have you decided to make Soo Ho look bad...</font>

71
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:15,091
<font color="yellow">by raiding the restaurant which his employees go often?</font>

72
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,721
<font color="yellow">I'm Soo Ho's dad. You're not his dad.</font>

73
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:25,921
<font color="yellow">You don't even deserve to breathe today.</font>

74
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:28,651
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

75
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:31,221
<font color="yellow">What kind of rumour are you trying to start...</font>

76
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:32,921
<font color="yellow">by visiting that man so often?</font>

77
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:36,591
<font color="yellow">You disgust me.</font>

78
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:38,391
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a heart?</font>

79
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,421
<font color="yellow">He used to spend his summers in our neighbourhood.</font>

80
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:43,691
<font color="yellow">I was happy to see him again.</font>

81
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:47,121
<font color="yellow">It reminded me of old times and made me wonder when I grew old.</font>

82
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:51,221
<font color="yellow">You're good at making it sound innocent.</font>

83
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,821
<font color="yellow">No matter how old you get,</font>

84
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,551
<font color="yellow">you're still a man and a woman.</font>

85
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:58,351
<font color="yellow">Nothing between you two can be that innocent.</font>

86
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:02,151
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you want to run away with him...</font>

87
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,991
<font color="yellow">by riding on the train you missed that day?</font>

88
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,121
<font color="yellow">- Are you serious? - You talked about what I deserve.</font>

89
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:11,591
<font color="yellow">You and I both don't deserve to be treated as parents by Soo Ho.</font>

90
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,291
<font color="yellow">You didn't know what harm you were doing...</font>

91
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:16,591
<font color="yellow">to our son and went around excitedly.</font>

92
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:19,491
<font color="yellow">Don't pretend you don't know.</font>

93
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,291

95
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:47,351
<font color="yellow">Oh, my... Look how nice the weather is.</font>

96
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,621
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well, Bo Ra?</font>

97
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,491
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

98
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,491
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, my friend.</font>

99
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:07,421
<font color="yellow">That restaurant is nice, isn't it? Their steak tastes amazing.</font>

100
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,921
<font color="yellow">You can count on that place to win a girl's heart.</font>

101
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,751
<font color="yellow">Even if you're horrible at dating, that legendary restaurant...</font>

102
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,391
<font color="yellow">You ruined it.</font>

103
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,351
<font color="yellow">You ruined it, didn't you?</font>

104
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,891
<font color="yellow">We didn't go there.</font>

105
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:25,391
<font color="yellow">- Did she stand you up? - No, we didn't go there.</font>

106
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:27,051
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask her out.</font>

107
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:29,621
<font color="yellow">So I haven't gotten dumped yet. Got it?</font>

108
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:30,921
<font color="yellow">Got it.</font>

109
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,821
<font color="yellow">Clean this place up. I want it spick and span.</font>

110
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:38,951
<font color="yellow">He got dumped.</font>

111
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:40,751
<font color="yellow">He got dumped for certain.</font>

112
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,591
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

113
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:49,821
<font color="yellow">Mr Je.</font>

114
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:51,921
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to you.</font>

115
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,321
<font color="yellow">Did you think about it all night and realise you made a mistake?</font>

116
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,721
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll give you a pass.</font>

117
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:03,391
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

118
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:06,521
<font color="yellow">I know I shouldn't ask you this.</font>

119
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:09,321
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

120
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,561
<font color="yellow">Please be my lucky charm one more time.</font>

121
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:14,251
<font color="yellow">Did you get a call from the hospital?</font>

122
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,061
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra opened her eyes.</font>

123
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,921
<font color="yellow">It's scary how greedy a person can get.</font>

124
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:29,151
<font color="yellow">I thought it was enough to see her once,</font>

125
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,891
<font color="yellow">but I want to see her after hearing she opened her eyes.</font>

126
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:34,151
<font color="yellow">I know I'm being selfish,</font>

127
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,951
<font color="yellow">but you came to my mind as soon as I got the call.</font>

128
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:38,421
<font color="yellow">I told you...</font>

129
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,691
<font color="yellow">I'd come with you whenever you want to see Bo Ra.</font>

130
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,451
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going in?</font>

131
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:54,951
<font color="yellow">Let's use this today.</font>

132
00:09:56,321 --> 00:10:00,791
<font color="yellow">Red colour drives out ghosts and bad luck.</font>

133
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:04,721
<font color="yellow">I think this would be good for both you and Bo Ra.</font>

134
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,191
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

135
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,191
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to wrap it around my pinkie?</font>

136
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:21,991
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra.</font>

137
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,091
<font color="yellow">I'm right here.</font>

138
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,321
<font color="yellow">Good job, Bo Ra.</font>

139
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,921
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

140
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:39,651
<font color="yellow">That person is the president of the company I work at.</font>

141
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:43,751
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't be able to see you if it weren't for him. I'm thankful.</font>

142
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,591
<font color="yellow">I hope you can get better and thank him with me.</font>

143
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,321
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

144
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,391
<font color="yellow">There's something wrong with that introduction.</font>

145
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:53,891
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

146
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:57,921
<font color="yellow">I'm the guy your sister is interested in.</font>

147
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,821
<font color="yellow">I have many questions for you.</font>

148
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:03,091
<font color="yellow">Was your sister always this frustrating?</font>

149
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:05,321
<font color="yellow">Or has she become like this lately? I'm curious to find out.</font>

150
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,691
<font color="yellow">- Please stop. - I'm talking to her.</font>

151
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:14,191
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui tried hard to save you.</font>

152
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,521
<font color="yellow">She did things most people wouldn't imagine.</font>

153
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:19,991
<font color="yellow">It's unbelievable.</font>

154
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,991
<font color="yellow">So please get up from this bed...</font>

155
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:24,251
<font color="yellow">and tell your sister...</font>

156
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,021
<font color="yellow">instead of me.</font>

157
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,051
<font color="yellow">Tell her to be happy.</font>

158
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:32,821
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

159
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:35,191
<font color="yellow">Tell her to love all she wants if she likes someone.</font>

160
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:38,491
<font color="yellow">Tell her to hold onto the guy she likes.</font>

161
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,191
<font color="yellow">Please tell her.</font>

162
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:45,991
<font color="yellow">I'll see you again soon.</font>

163
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,891
<font color="yellow">Give up.</font>

164
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,121
<font color="yellow">Give up trying to force yourself...</font>

165
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,191
<font color="yellow">and come to me.</font>

166
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:16,191
<font color="yellow">- I... - Think carefully.</font>

167
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:19,291
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra woke up the day after we kissed.</font>

168
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,421
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a good sign?</font>

169
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,651
<font color="yellow">- You're all crazy about fate. - You don't believe it, though.</font>

170
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:24,821
<font color="yellow">I don't.</font>

171
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:26,591
<font color="yellow">But I can understand you.</font>

172
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,451
<font color="yellow">I understand you need something to rely on even if it's ridiculous.</font>

173
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:33,351
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to be like that, too.</font>

174
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,551
<font color="yellow">When I was little,</font>

175
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,751
<font color="yellow">I was always bored in math class.</font>

176
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,491
<font color="yellow">I always got the answers straight away,</font>

177
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,521
<font color="yellow">but I had to wait until the other kids were done.</font>

178
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,821
<font color="yellow">I guess you need time as well, Bo Nui.</font>

179
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:07,991
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>

180
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,421
<font color="yellow">No matter how long it takes, the answers are given.</font>

181
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,521
<font color="yellow">When you find the answer in your heart,</font>

182
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:18,721
<font color="yellow">come to me by yourself...</font>

183
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:20,791
<font color="yellow">willingly.</font>

184
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:25,491
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

185
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,921
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel bad? Should I really cut it?</font>

186
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:47,351
<font color="yellow">I like her.</font>

187
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:56,021
<font color="yellow">I'll look good with short hair, right?</font>

188
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:58,991
<font color="yellow">You have a small and pretty face. You'll look good with anything.</font>

189
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:00,691
<font color="yellow">I'll cut it then.</font>

190
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:06,421
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

191
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:12,421
<font color="yellow">- Gary. - Diamond or emerald, what's better?</font>

192
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:24,751
<font color="yellow">What's happening? A ring?</font>

193
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,221
<font color="yellow">I think diamond is too much.</font>

194
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:31,291
<font color="yellow">Emerald is too humble though it is her birthstone.</font>

195
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:35,321
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me you're going to propose to Bo Nui.</font>

196
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:39,421
<font color="yellow">I'm so used to having girls hitting on me, so I wasn't alert.</font>

197
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:43,251
<font color="yellow">I realised I accidentally confessed my feelings.</font>

198
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,821
<font color="yellow">I have to do it properly.</font>

199
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,951
<font color="yellow">Can we talk outside for a while? Let's go out.</font>

200
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:52,951
<font color="yellow">Wait. I haven't chosen it yet.</font>

201
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:59,751
<font color="yellow">You're leaving in three weeks. What are you trying to do?</font>

202
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,421
<font color="yellow">Isn't it the same for you?</font>

203
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:04,021
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do with Mr Je?</font>

204
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,791
<font color="yellow">Is it going well?</font>

205
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,821
<font color="yellow">He's looking elsewhere just for a while.</font>

206
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,891
<font color="yellow">He'll come back to me soon.</font>

207
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:16,421
<font color="yellow">You're very confident, Amy.</font>

208
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:19,791
<font color="yellow">Confidence...</font>

209
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:21,891
<font color="yellow">is everything I got.</font>

210
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,951
<font color="yellow">You're serious about Bo Nui, aren't you?</font>

211
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:30,291
<font color="yellow">Of course I am.</font>

212
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,421
<font color="yellow">It's my first time to buy a ring.</font>

213
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,191
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

214
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:41,391
<font color="yellow">You know that I don't like losing, right?</font>

215
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:44,951
<font color="yellow">I will support you with every way possible.</font>

216
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,151
<font color="yellow">So just win. Okay?</font>

217
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,151
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd be on my side no matter what.</font>

218
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:55,291
<font color="yellow">Which is better? Diamond is too much, isn't it?</font>

219
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,951
<font color="yellow">Well, there's no girl who doesn't like diamond.</font>

220
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,151
<font color="yellow">I'll choose it for you.</font>

221
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:13,421
<font color="yellow">- The fried chickens are here. - Hello.</font>

222
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:14,991
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - All right.</font>

223
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:18,421
<font color="yellow">You're the first customer of the smart watch, aren't you?</font>

224
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:23,521
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - The president of...</font>

225
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:24,821
<font color="yellow">Coconut Company bowed to you on the spot.</font>

226
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,491
<font color="yellow">- Coconut! - What?</font>

227
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:27,621
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

228
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:31,221
<font color="yellow">01 Fried Chicken.</font>

229
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:34,491
<font color="yellow">I thought you came up with that name using the binary system.</font>

230
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:35,891
<font color="yellow">But that wasn't it.</font>

231
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:39,121
<font color="yellow">"The genius first generation game programmer Ahn Yeong Il."</font>

232
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,591
<font color="yellow">That's you, right?</font>

233
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:42,691
<font color="yellow">("The genius first generation game programmer Ahn Yeong Il")</font>

234
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,991
<font color="yellow">- It's you, right? - It's really him!</font>

235
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:46,351
<font color="yellow">- Let me see it. - Sir!</font>

236
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:48,421
<font color="yellow">- Oh my gosh! - You didn't know, right?</font>

237
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,721
<font color="yellow">That's a long time ago. That's more than 20 years ago.</font>

238
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:53,091
<font color="yellow">It's not a big deal.</font>

239
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:56,821
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

240
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:58,091
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello, Sir.</font>

241
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:01,391
<font color="yellow">- I was going to visit you. - It's all right.</font>

242
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:03,691
<font color="yellow">Take this. I'm leaving.</font>

243
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,821
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

244
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:06,591
<font color="yellow">Just one minute.</font>

245
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,551
<font color="yellow">This is it. I can't seem to figure it out.</font>

246
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:28,821
<font color="yellow">The interface parameter has a problem.</font>

247
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,321
<font color="yellow">Check the XML parameters.</font>

248
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,421
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

249
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,721
<font color="yellow">Mr Je must know it better.</font>

250
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:39,421
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

251
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:48,121
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it'll be enough to pay for the damage.</font>

252
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,321
<font color="yellow">This is unnecessary! I can't accept it.</font>

253
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,761
<font color="yellow">- I didn't buy anything new. - Just take it.</font>

254
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:55,261
<font color="yellow">Just come more often from now on.</font>

255
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:56,651
<font color="yellow">That will do.</font>

256
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:04,351
<font color="yellow">By the way, how do you know my mother?</font>

257
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:12,151
<font color="yellow">During college, I went to do volunteer activities every year.</font>

258
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:16,351
<font color="yellow">I gave computer lessons and fixed things for free.</font>

259
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:19,091
<font color="yellow">We got to know each other then,</font>

260
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,821
<font color="yellow">and here we are.</font>

261
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,621
<font color="yellow">Hui Ae was very fond of me.</font>

262
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,051
<font color="yellow">I mean your mother.</font>

263
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:33,021
<font color="yellow">Then why did my father treat you like that?</font>

264
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,991
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not sure about that, either.</font>

265
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:40,291
<font color="yellow">My apologies.</font>

266
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:43,321
<font color="yellow">If you keep apologising to me,</font>

267
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,921
<font color="yellow">I will be too uncomfortable to see you.</font>

268
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:47,351
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

269
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:49,691
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't know,</font>

270
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:52,321
<font color="yellow">but I've been your fan.</font>

271
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:56,021
<font color="yellow">When I saw your first game seven years ago,</font>

272
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:58,021
<font color="yellow">I was really touched.</font>

273
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,651
<font color="yellow">Since then, I've been following you around...</font>

274
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,821
<font color="yellow">whenever you showcase your new game.</font>

275
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,351
<font color="yellow">I was like a girl fan.</font>

276
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:09,621
<font color="yellow">You're still very skilled. Why are you running a restaurant?</font>

277
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:13,791
<font color="yellow">I was at my peak when I was just about your age.</font>

278
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,351
<font color="yellow">Everything I got my hands on was successful...</font>

279
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:17,791
<font color="yellow">and people lined up to sponsor me.</font>

280
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,991
<font color="yellow">The games I developed for myself received so much attention,</font>

281
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:22,821
<font color="yellow">and I worked like a mad man.</font>

282
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:25,821
<font color="yellow">When I finally got back to my senses,</font>

283
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:27,261
<font color="yellow">I was alone.</font>

284
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:30,451
<font color="yellow">Well, what kind of wife would be willing to live...</font>

285
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:33,221
<font color="yellow">her whole life looking back of her husband?</font>

286
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,051
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have let her go.</font>

287
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:41,891
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do that.</font>

288
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:45,091
<font color="yellow">Make sure to hold onto...</font>

289
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,491
<font color="yellow">the person precious to you.</font>

290
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:54,191
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm being ridiculous. Clearly, you're better off than me.</font>

291
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,291
<font color="yellow">- Gosh... - It's my first time.</font>

292
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,351
<font color="yellow">You're the first adult to tell me these things.</font>

293
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:05,051
<font color="yellow">I went over the line because you are my friend's son.</font>

294
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:09,221
<font color="yellow">Just forget what I said. I will get going then.</font>

295
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:10,591
<font color="yellow">I will visit you sometimes.</font>

296
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:14,421
<font color="yellow">I will go to your restaurant with Bo Nui.</font>

297
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:16,091
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

298
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,191
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for this. - You're welcome.</font>

299
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:27,051
<font color="yellow">Are you going to go eat fried chicken with Bo Nui?</font>

300
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,451
<font color="yellow">You're a beast.</font>

301
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,151
<font color="yellow">(Mother)</font>

302
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:38,591
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

303
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:42,151
<font color="yellow">When you get dumped, you never fully realise it immediately.</font>

304
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:46,421
<font color="yellow">- Gosh... - I love you, Bo Nui.</font>

305
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,351
<font color="yellow">I love you, Bo Nui.</font>

306
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:51,121
<font color="yellow">I love you, Bo Nui.</font>

307
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:53,921
<font color="yellow">Oh, Bo Nui!</font>

308
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,151
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui!</font>

309
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,151
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho. Is that right?</font>

310
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:01,951
<font color="yellow">Did you get exhausted?</font>

311
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:06,351
<font color="yellow">You just solved the questions you knew. Why did you?</font>

312
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:13,591
<font color="yellow">Let's smile. Only then you will get lucky.</font>

313
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:29,761
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>

314
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,891
<font color="yellow">No matter how long it takes, the answers are given.</font>

315
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,821
<font color="yellow">When you find the answer in your heart,</font>

316
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,691
<font color="yellow">come to me by yourself...</font>

317
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,591
<font color="yellow">willingly.</font>

318
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:53,751
<font color="yellow">Hi, Bo Nui. How are you?</font>

319
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,091
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

320
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,091
<font color="yellow">You look nice.</font>

321
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:00,521
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

322
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:03,121
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Soo Ho will like it.</font>

323
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,091
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

324
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:07,721
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

325
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:11,121
<font color="yellow">My head seems to be filled with thoughts of Soo Ho lately.</font>

326
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:12,821
<font color="yellow">I didn't know I said it out loud.</font>

327
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:15,291
<font color="yellow">This must be why people say you can't hide your feelings.</font>

328
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:19,321
<font color="yellow">Is Soo Ho in his office?</font>

329
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:45,691
<font color="yellow">That's impressive.</font>

330
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:48,351
<font color="yellow">Zeze Factory is skilled.</font>

331
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:52,751
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare the beta test in this version.</font>

332
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,491
<font color="yellow">Let's take some of the women out from the party scene.</font>

333
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:58,421
<font color="yellow">It makes Gary look like a playboy.</font>

334
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,651
<font color="yellow">I also noticed that he often falls down on the court.</font>

335
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:03,551
<font color="yellow">Gary is quick on his feet...</font>

336
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:06,491
<font color="yellow">and rarely has his knees touch the floor.</font>

337
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:09,721
<font color="yellow">- I see. - I expected something better...</font>

338
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,391
<font color="yellow">when I heard Bo Nui was in charge of the scenario.</font>

339
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:15,091
<font color="yellow">You know Gary less than I thought.</font>

340
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,521
<font color="yellow">Put more effort into it.</font>

341
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:19,151
<font color="yellow">Gary was okay with this.</font>

342
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:21,921
<font color="yellow">He'd agree to anything Bo Nui does.</font>

343
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:26,121
<font color="yellow">Please tell us anything else we should modify.</font>

344
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:29,791
<font color="yellow">Let's check from the beginning.</font>

345
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:31,621
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

346
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:39,521
<font color="yellow">Did you do anything to irritate the regional director?</font>

347
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:41,151
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

348
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:43,321
<font color="yellow">Clients always give us feedback.</font>

349
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:45,921
<font color="yellow">She was too picky about the smallest details.</font>

350
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,421
<font color="yellow">I got the impression she was picking on you.</font>

351
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,921
<font color="yellow">Is she trying to get back at you for dumping Gary?</font>

352
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,291
<font color="yellow">No, that's ridiculous.</font>

353
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:55,291
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so hard on her?</font>

354
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:56,921
<font color="yellow">She's just meticulous.</font>

355
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:59,651
<font color="yellow">I'm worried all that will come back to you.</font>

356
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:02,221
<font color="yellow">Do you have a lot to modify?</font>

357
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:05,121
<font color="yellow">No, I can get it done today.</font>

358
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:06,721
<font color="yellow">We'll do a proper job.</font>

359
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:10,391
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

360
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,351
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Bo Nui. - Okay.</font>

361
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:27,121
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Turn around and face forward.</font>

362
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:31,721
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

363
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:33,751
<font color="yellow">I'm proud of you.</font>

364
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:14,621
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

365
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,091
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner at my place.</font>

366
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:34,551
<font color="yellow">I'll cook something nice.</font>

367
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:36,821
<font color="yellow">I can't. I have work to do.</font>

368
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:38,691
<font color="yellow">(I can't. I have work to do.)</font>

369
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:49,621
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

370
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:52,421
<font color="yellow">When can we have dinner? Stop avoiding me.</font>

371
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:54,321
<font color="yellow">I'm not avoiding you.</font>

372
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,051
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wait until you get here.</font>

373
00:25:58,351 --> 00:26:00,051
<font color="yellow">I really can't go. Make sure you eat!</font>

374
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:04,391
<font color="yellow">Are you going home now?</font>

375
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:07,791
<font color="yellow">Do you still not have an answer?</font>

376
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:12,151
<font color="yellow">I don't get it because I'm pretty sure you know the answer.</font>

377
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:15,351
<font color="yellow">It's a yes or no question and the answer is yes.</font>

378
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,451
<font color="yellow">The answer is that you like me.</font>

379
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:20,151
<font color="yellow">It's yes between 0 and 1.</font>

380
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:21,491
<font color="yellow">Coffee or tea? Yes.</font>

381
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:22,991
<font color="yellow">It should always be yes.</font>

382
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:26,621
<font color="yellow">- I already told you it's no. - Wrong!</font>

383
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:28,421
<font color="yellow">You got it wrong.</font>

384
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:30,651
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll wait.</font>

385
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,891
<font color="yellow">- Why are you sighing? - Gosh!</font>

386
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:41,491
<font color="yellow">That's my bike.</font>

387
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,421
<font color="yellow">I know. Can't you tell?</font>

388
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,291
<font color="yellow">I was waiting here because I wanted to see you.</font>

389
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:53,821
<font color="yellow">Why weren't you in the meeting today?</font>

390
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:56,221
<font color="yellow">I took some time getting ready, thinking I'd see you.</font>

391
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:57,921
<font color="yellow">Someone else is in charge of that project.</font>

392
00:26:58,591 --> 00:26:59,951
<font color="yellow">Is there anything I should know of?</font>

393
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:02,121
<font color="yellow">Yes, there is.</font>

394
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:03,821
<font color="yellow">It's something very important.</font>

395
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:05,451
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - I'm...</font>

396
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,751
<font color="yellow">hungry.</font>

397
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:09,821
<font color="yellow">Buy me dinner.</font>

398
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:14,421
<font color="yellow">Here is your sushi.</font>

399
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,091
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

400
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:18,551
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

401
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:28,621
<font color="yellow">Sadly, I have something to eat.</font>

402
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:29,821
<font color="yellow">Yes, you do.</font>

403
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:30,951
<font color="yellow">Were you happy to save money?</font>

404
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:32,451
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

405
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:33,751
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the food.</font>

406
00:27:39,051 --> 00:27:40,051
<font color="yellow">You remembered, didn't you?</font>

407
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:42,591
<font color="yellow">On your 18th birthday,</font>

408
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:45,121
<font color="yellow">you forced yourself to eat the sushi I bought...</font>

409
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:46,591
<font color="yellow">and ended up throwing up.</font>

410
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:48,991
<font color="yellow">Did I?</font>

411
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:57,021
<font color="yellow">That was the first time you told me about your father.</font>

412
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,551
<font color="yellow">Was it that day?</font>

413
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:02,591
<font color="yellow">Can I have an order of sushi to-go?</font>

414
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:03,691
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Thank you.</font>

415
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:06,951
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho, have you forgotten?</font>

416
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:11,121
<font color="yellow">Why? You always remembered more than I did.</font>

417
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:13,751
<font color="yellow">That day,</font>

418
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:17,791
<font color="yellow">you opened up to me for the first time.</font>

419
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:21,321
<font color="yellow">It's the day I became special to you.</font>

420
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:24,421
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about that day, but you're...</font>

421
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,021
<font color="yellow">Amy.</font>

422
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:37,451
<font color="yellow">Why are you ordering food to-go? Is it for Ryang Ha?</font>

423
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,521
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui is working late.</font>

424
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:41,321
<font color="yellow">She has to eat.</font>

425
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:46,991
<font color="yellow">You've changed a lot.</font>

426
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,051
<font color="yellow">You worry about your employee's dinner.</font>

427
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:51,791
<font color="yellow">I told you before. She's more than just an employee to me.</font>

428
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:54,191
<font color="yellow">You're just being curious...</font>

429
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:56,321
<font color="yellow">because she's different.</font>

430
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:58,751
<font color="yellow">You're attracted to her because she's unique.</font>

431
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:00,721
<font color="yellow">I know you.</font>

432
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:04,291
<font color="yellow">You used to struggle over a problem for three nights...</font>

433
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:06,991
<font color="yellow">if you couldn't solve it. This is the same.</font>

434
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:11,391
<font color="yellow">Why did you become my friend?</font>

435
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,421
<font color="yellow">You came back even when I told you not to.</font>

436
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:18,191
<font color="yellow">I told you I was curious about you.</font>

437
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,651
<font color="yellow">I wanted to know who the young genius was.</font>

438
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,821
<font color="yellow">You looked terrified...</font>

439
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,021
<font color="yellow">like a duckling in a strange place.</font>

440
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:29,951
<font color="yellow">How was I supposed to leave you alone?</font>

441
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:34,191
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

442
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:36,021
<font color="yellow">that was love?</font>

443
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:39,491
<font color="yellow">Are you questioning me?</font>

444
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:41,891
<font color="yellow">Or do you want confirmation?</font>

445
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:43,221
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

446
00:29:43,891 --> 00:29:44,921
<font color="yellow">I just thought you'd know.</font>

447
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:47,221
<font color="yellow">That's how I feel about Bo Nui.</font>

448
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:48,891
<font color="yellow">I can't leave her alone.</font>

449
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:50,791
<font color="yellow">I don't want her to cry.</font>

450
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,621
<font color="yellow">I don't want her to be in pain,</font>

451
00:29:53,721 --> 00:29:55,351
<font color="yellow">and I don't want her to be unhappy any more.</font>

452
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:58,691
<font color="yellow">I want to make it possible for her.</font>

453
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,591

00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:07,621
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

464
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:11,551
<font color="yellow">How does he understand? He seems like a person.</font>

465
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:13,751
<font color="yellow">I have to go clubbing, so hurry up and talk.</font>

466
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,651
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

467
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,891
<font color="yellow">This isn't going anywhere since that day.</font>

468
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:22,991
<font color="yellow">So I made some plans.</font>

469
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:24,551
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

470
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:27,351
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking that if you help me out...</font>

471
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:28,821
<font color="yellow">a little bit,</font>

472
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:33,021
<font color="yellow">it would look like we were meant to be.</font>

473
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:36,621
<font color="yellow">My love</font>

474
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:40,151
<font color="yellow">She doesn't know that the bus already left.</font>

475
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,251
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

476
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:43,621
<font color="yellow">At that time, he will realise.</font>

477
00:31:44,191 --> 00:31:45,251
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

478
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:48,391
<font color="yellow">"The blue bird was right next to me."</font>

479
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:53,121
<font color="yellow">It's such a beautiful night, and I have to go through this.</font>

480
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:55,321
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

481
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,621
<font color="yellow">Do you think I like doing this?</font>

482
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:01,921
<font color="yellow">Why would I meet you if it weren't for Mr Je?</font>

483
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,091
<font color="yellow">If you treat me like this,</font>

484
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,721
<font color="yellow">you'll miss all the important information.</font>

485
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,351
<font color="yellow">We'll see if they are important or useless.</font>

486
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,151
<font color="yellow">Who am I?</font>

487
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:14,751
<font color="yellow">I am Soo Ho's only friend and guardian.</font>

488
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,451
<font color="yellow">With my tongue's help,</font>

489
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:19,851
<font color="yellow">you could be sitting next to Soo Ho...</font>

490
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:22,691
<font color="yellow">in 30 minutes. You see?</font>

491
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,921
<font color="yellow">I can make him sit right there.</font>

492
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:26,721
<font color="yellow">Right next to you.</font>

493
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,291
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

494
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:33,551
<font color="yellow">I will do anything you ask.</font>

495
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,551
<font color="yellow">Just tell me.</font>

496
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:38,821
<font color="yellow">Let's take it off.</font>

497
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:42,151
<font color="yellow">- What? - Take off your glasses.</font>

498
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,921
<font color="yellow">And lose some weight.</font>

499
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:46,421
<font color="yellow">Take off your braces, too.</font>

500
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:48,091
<font color="yellow">Let's take off everything.</font>

501
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:50,451
<font color="yellow">Let's think after that. Okay?</font>

502
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:38,721
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

503
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:53,051
<font color="yellow">It's delicious, isn't it?</font>

504
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:55,121
<font color="yellow">You're thankful, right?</font>

505
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:59,121
<font color="yellow">You must want to come to me by now, but you're showing no signs.</font>

506
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,121
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

507
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:03,051
<font color="yellow">I'll wait.</font>

508
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:05,221
<font color="yellow">Don't whistle at night. It's bad luck.</font>

509
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:06,451
<font color="yellow">Stop saying superstitious things.</font>

510
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,191
<font color="yellow">I did it intentionally.</font>

511
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:11,791
<font color="yellow">I chose "Sad Fate" on purpose so you can hear it.</font>

512
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:14,751
<font color="yellow">- Why? - You follow the whistle version...</font>

513
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,691
<font color="yellow">of the song you like,</font>

514
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:20,691
<font color="yellow">and you find your crush holding something delicious.</font>

515
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,521
<font color="yellow">It's nice, right?</font>

516
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:30,661
<font color="yellow">You know the last memory is very important.</font>

517
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:33,091
<font color="yellow">When a person evaluates an incident or an experience,</font>

518
00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:35,491
<font color="yellow">they tend to depend on the most intense or...</font>

519
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:37,591
<font color="yellow">the last moment.</font>

520
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,821
<font color="yellow">I will turn all your sad...</font>

521
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:46,191
<font color="yellow">and hurtful memory into good memory.</font>

522
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:48,991
<font color="yellow">I'll make it to be the most intense and last moment.</font>

523
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,051
<font color="yellow">You'll remember it with a smile.</font>

524
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,091
<font color="yellow">Still, you can't whistle at night.</font>

525
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:57,551
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

526
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:00,291
<font color="yellow">Last time, you wrote your father's name in red...</font>

527
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:01,891
<font color="yellow">and he got hurt.</font>

528
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:04,521
<font color="yellow">Even if there is the slightest chance, you can't risk it.</font>

529
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:06,451
<font color="yellow">But that was just a coincidence.</font>

530
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:09,821
<font color="yellow">Why would you try to associate it with cause and effect?</font>

531
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:14,221
<font color="yellow">Have you...</font>

532
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:16,691
<font color="yellow">talked to your father?</font>

533
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:42,421
<font color="yellow">He must be regretting it.</font>

534
00:35:44,451 --> 00:35:45,661
<font color="yellow">He loves you.</font>

535
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:48,591
<font color="yellow">He loves you,</font>

536
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:51,221
<font color="yellow">but he doesn't know how to express his love.</font>

537
00:35:56,351 --> 00:35:57,421
<font color="yellow">Have you ever thought that...</font>

538
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:00,321
<font color="yellow">it would be easier if your father was not...</font>

539
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:02,391
<font color="yellow">your biological father?</font>

540
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,021
<font color="yellow">You can talk to him about that, too.</font>

541
00:36:06,921 --> 00:36:10,091
<font color="yellow">You can tell him how much and why you got hurt.</font>

542
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:12,691
<font color="yellow">He can't know if you don't tell him.</font>

543
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:19,291
<font color="yellow">We're very much alike.</font>

544
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:22,821
<font color="yellow">We're both stubborn and we only think about ourselves.</font>

545
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:24,721
<font color="yellow">We don't know how to apologise, either.</font>

546
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:27,661
<font color="yellow">When we fight with someone, we'd rather not see them again.</font>

547
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:29,351
<font color="yellow">You know how the magnets...</font>

548
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,851
<font color="yellow">of the same poles repel each other.</font>

549
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:37,951
<font color="yellow">It's right for us to keep this much distance.</font>

550
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:40,491
<font color="yellow">Still, you're a family.</font>

551
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:42,521
<font color="yellow">- It's too bad we are. - Mr Je.</font>

552
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:47,551
<font color="yellow">When we start dating,</font>

553
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:49,521
<font color="yellow">I should stop you from calling me Mr Je.</font>

554
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:51,891
<font color="yellow">Let's go down.</font>

555
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:05,091
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

556
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:17,521
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's you. Welcome.</font>

557
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:19,321
<font color="yellow">I heard Bo Nui is upstairs.</font>

558
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,691
<font color="yellow">Yes. She's working overtime today. She's still upstairs.</font>

559
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,951
<font color="yellow">You brought her food.</font>

560
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:26,791
<font color="yellow">It's a secret.</font>

561
00:37:30,821 --> 00:37:31,851
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

562
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,391
<font color="yellow">Are you looking at this?</font>

563
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:36,821
<font color="yellow">You should look here.</font>

564
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:40,421
<font color="yellow">I should.</font>

565
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,161
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

566
00:37:45,321 --> 00:37:46,621
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

567
00:37:47,951 --> 00:37:50,621
<font color="yellow">You told me to look at the screen. I am looking at the screen.</font>

568
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:24,661
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

569
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,491
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

570
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:33,791
<font color="yellow">- That should be fine. - Okay.</font>

571
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:35,691
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

572
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:45,091
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!</font>

573
00:38:46,521 --> 00:38:48,791
<font color="yellow">- Gosh... - I'll file for a restraining order.</font>

574
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:51,721
<font color="yellow">What restraining order?</font>

575
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:53,291
<font color="yellow">We already kissed twice.</font>

576
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:55,621
<font color="yellow">- Twice? Have you been dreaming? - What?</font>

577
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:58,391
<font color="yellow">Dreaming? Are you serious?</font>

578
00:38:58,691 --> 00:38:59,721
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

579
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:03,161
<font color="yellow">You got drunk and went out of control.</font>

580
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:04,691
<font color="yellow">You puked and kissed me!</font>

581
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:08,091
<font color="yellow">My tiger!</font>

582
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:18,621
<font color="yellow">People said I should hear the sound of bells when I have my first kiss.</font>

583
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:19,791
<font color="yellow">But I didn't hear anything.</font>

584
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,221
<font color="yellow">Your first kiss?</font>

585
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:28,751
<font color="yellow">Isn't Amy your first love?</font>

586
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:31,921
<font color="yellow">No! She's not! Everything was first for me.</font>

587
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,421
<font color="yellow">I confessed my feelings, held hands and kissed for the first time!</font>

588
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:39,821
<font color="yellow">So you're responsible for me.</font>

589
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:03,191
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

590
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:04,691
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

591
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,921
<font color="yellow">I'll go home now.</font>

592
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:45,421
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

593
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:47,351
<font color="yellow">that was love?</font>

594
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:55,091
<font color="yellow">I wonder, too. What was it then?</font>

595
00:40:58,251 --> 00:40:59,421
<font color="yellow">What was it?</font>

596
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,221
<font color="yellow">Why does it keep hurting me?</font>

597
00:41:09,391 --> 00:41:10,421
<font color="yellow">Did you go home well?</font>

598
00:41:11,491 --> 00:41:12,491
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

599
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:14,091
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

600
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:17,321
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

601
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,421
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

602
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:22,551
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

603
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:24,661
<font color="yellow">It's not working well.</font>

604
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:26,621
<font color="yellow">Good night, Mr Je. I will see you tomorrow.</font>

605
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:35,121
<font color="yellow">How long will she struggle with this easy question?</font>

606
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:40,051
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and come, Bo Nui.</font>

607
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,591
<font color="yellow">All spirits in the world.</font>

608
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:53,991
<font color="yellow">Please help me.</font>

609
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,921
<font color="yellow">I want to trust him,</font>

610
00:41:57,621 --> 00:41:59,251
<font color="yellow">and I want to hold his hands.</font>

611
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:01,421
<font color="yellow">Please help me...</font>

612
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:04,291
<font color="yellow">so that I can control my feelings.</font>

613
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:32,891
<font color="yellow">Geon Uk.</font>

614
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:34,491
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

615
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:44,951
<font color="yellow">I really worked late last night.</font>

616
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:46,251
<font color="yellow">I wasn't avoiding you.</font>

617
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,991
<font color="yellow">I think those reporters are here again.</font>

618
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:01,691
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

619
00:43:02,491 --> 00:43:05,291
<font color="yellow">I'm okay because I've been on TV, but your case is different.</font>

620
00:43:05,691 --> 00:43:06,691
<font color="yellow">Wear them.</font>

621
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,421
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Geon Uk.</font>

622
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:12,621
<font color="yellow">What did you make yesterday? You said you'd make something tasty.</font>

623
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,351
<font color="yellow">I just picked up some tteokbokki.</font>

624
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:17,161
<font color="yellow">I ate it all by myself.</font>

625
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:19,551
<font color="yellow">You should've saved some for me! Let's eat together next time.</font>

626
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:20,551
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

627
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:22,451
<font color="yellow">Have a good day at work. See you later.</font>

628
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:23,551
<font color="yellow">See you!</font>

629
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:00,391
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

630
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:04,621
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Why are you hovering around?</font>

631
00:44:05,451 --> 00:44:08,221
<font color="yellow">Let me see your ID. Show me your ID! Sir!</font>

632
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:09,451
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

633
00:44:16,951 --> 00:44:17,951
<font color="yellow">Who's that now?</font>

634
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:19,791
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many hawkers?</font>

635
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:21,551
<font color="yellow">Sir. Sir!</font>

636
00:44:21,921 --> 00:44:24,821
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Stop pestering me, Sir.</font>

637
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:26,821
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you the truth!</font>

638
00:44:26,951 --> 00:44:28,991
<font color="yellow">I'm Je Soo Ho's father, Je Mul Po!</font>

639
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:32,951
<font color="yellow">Shall I show you my ID?</font>

640
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,921
<font color="yellow">There's no need.</font>

641
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:36,151
<font color="yellow">It's written right here.</font>

642
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:38,151
<font color="yellow">"There is a man that comes here drunk between 11pm and 1am."</font>

643
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:40,791
<font color="yellow">"That's Mr Je's father. Don't let him in."</font>

644
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:43,691
<font color="yellow">It's broad daylight and you're sober, so you mustn't be his father.</font>

645
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:46,151
<font color="yellow">I guess you're here to pitch your idea to get an investment,</font>

646
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,691
<font color="yellow">but meeting famous people isn't easy. Please leave now.</font>

647
00:44:48,821 --> 00:44:49,821
<font color="yellow">Mr Je Mul Po.</font>

648
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,691
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

649
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,651
<font color="yellow">Are you here to see the president?</font>

650
00:44:57,721 --> 00:44:58,721
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

651
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:01,521
<font color="yellow">- Don't let him know. - Well...</font>

652
00:45:07,221 --> 00:45:08,491
<font color="yellow">Is he really the father?</font>

653
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:14,691
<font color="yellow">- How does he know you? - Because I'm an employee.</font>

654
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:48,621
<font color="yellow">- What's going on with the scenario? - I shared it with team members.</font>

655
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:50,691
<font color="yellow">- What about the design? - It'll be ready by the afternoon.</font>

656
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,291
<font color="yellow">- What about dating then? - By tonight...</font>

657
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:16,921
<font color="yellow">She said by tonight.</font>

658
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,051
<font color="yellow">By tonight.</font>

659
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:30,821
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho! I'm at your place!</font>

660
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:48,921
<font color="yellow">Did you give my passcode to my mum?</font>

661
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:51,751
<font color="yellow">Did I give your passcode to your mother? Yes.</font>

662
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:56,821
<font color="yellow">You said you'd change it!</font>

663
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,221
<font color="yellow">He was preoccupied with Bo Nui and forgot about it. Why blame me?</font>

664
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,121
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is so heavy.</font>

665
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:32,921
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? I just came to clean your place.</font>

666
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:37,421
<font color="yellow">I don't need your help with cleaning. I can do it myself.</font>

667
00:47:43,521 --> 00:47:45,691
<font color="yellow">I can make my place squeaky clean.</font>

668
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:49,151
<font color="yellow">I filled up your refrigerator with food.</font>

669
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:51,721
<font color="yellow">I was going to start cleaning after having this cup of tea.</font>

670
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:52,951
<font color="yellow">There's no need.</font>

671
00:47:54,391 --> 00:47:57,291
<font color="yellow">All right. I'm sure you can take care of it yourself.</font>

672
00:47:58,221 --> 00:47:59,221
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving?</font>

673
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:01,291
<font color="yellow">I should raid your place often.</font>

674
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:03,121
<font color="yellow">I'm happy to see you.</font>

675
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:05,121
<font color="yellow">Don't come here.</font>

676
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:07,591
<font color="yellow">Then you should visit us.</font>

677
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:09,921
<font color="yellow">Are you never going to see your father again or what?</font>

678
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:13,021
<font color="yellow">He hasn't been able to sleep for the last few days.</font>

679
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:15,251
<font color="yellow">Give him a chance, Soo Ho.</font>

680
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,821
<font color="yellow">I'm going to change my passcode. Ryang Ha won't know, so don't ask.</font>

681
00:48:18,151 --> 00:48:19,151
<font color="yellow">Get going now.</font>

682
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:32,091
<font color="yellow">I thought about it and realised that I don't know anything about you...</font>

683
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:34,591
<font color="yellow">when you know many things about me.</font>

684
00:48:36,051 --> 00:48:37,521
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to know?</font>

685
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:40,291
<font color="yellow">- Just like now, we can... - What do your parents do?</font>

686
00:48:40,491 --> 00:48:41,491
<font color="yellow">Do they live in Seoul?</font>

687
00:48:43,491 --> 00:48:45,421
<font color="yellow">Both of them passed away 10 years ago.</font>

688
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,291
<font color="yellow">Do you have any siblings?</font>

689
00:48:50,691 --> 00:48:52,121
<font color="yellow">I have a younger sister.</font>

690
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:53,951
<font color="yellow">She's sick and at a hospital now.</font>

691
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:56,121
<font color="yellow">So do you take care of your sister alone?</font>

692
00:48:56,491 --> 00:48:57,491
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

693
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,251
<font color="yellow">Which university did you go to?</font>

694
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:03,691
<font color="yellow">You got into Zeze, so you must've graduated from one of the top...</font>

695
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,691
<font color="yellow">I dropped out of university.</font>

696
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:12,321
<font color="yellow">Are you and Soo Ho seeing each other now?</font>

697
00:49:12,651 --> 00:49:14,751
<font color="yellow">No, we're not. Never.</font>

698
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:17,351
<font color="yellow">I think Soo Ho...</font>

699
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:19,721
<font color="yellow">likes you, though.</font>

700
00:49:19,951 --> 00:49:21,051
<font color="yellow">I don't feel the same way.</font>

701
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,551
<font color="yellow">I told him about it, and I won't reciprocate his feelings.</font>

702
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:26,751
<font color="yellow">How dare you reject my son!</font>

703
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:28,491
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

704
00:49:30,121 --> 00:49:31,121
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

705
00:49:39,921 --> 00:49:40,921
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

706
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:49,891
<font color="yellow">This is pretty. Try it on.</font>

707
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,291
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

708
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,321
<font color="yellow">That looks so pretty on you.</font>

709
00:50:03,721 --> 00:50:04,751
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you?</font>

710
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:07,891
<font color="yellow">That you'd buy me a mink fur coat if I don't accept these.</font>

711
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:09,621
<font color="yellow">Just take them.</font>

712
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:12,321
<font color="yellow">Put on those pretty make-ups and go on dates with Soo Ho.</font>

713
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:14,051
<font color="yellow">That's really not what's happening.</font>

714
00:50:14,151 --> 00:50:16,251
<font color="yellow">Then why did Soo Ho put up your photos...</font>

715
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:17,821
<font color="yellow">all over the walls in his room?</font>

716
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,921
<font color="yellow">You said that he's cool.</font>

717
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:24,821
<font color="yellow">You just don't see him as a man?</font>

718
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:29,821
<font color="yellow">All right, fine. I won't force you.</font>

719
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:32,321
<font color="yellow">You should still accept these.</font>

720
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:34,421
<font color="yellow">We go to the same fortune-teller.</font>

721
00:50:34,691 --> 00:50:36,891
<font color="yellow">Just think of them as a gift from a friend, okay?</font>

722
00:50:38,921 --> 00:50:40,151
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

723
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:44,551
<font color="yellow">On that note, Bo Nui...</font>

724
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:48,351
<font color="yellow">Could I ask you for a favour?</font>

725
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:49,891
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

726
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:52,391
<font color="yellow">You put up her photos on your wall.</font>

727
00:50:53,221 --> 00:50:54,221
<font color="yellow">You actually did that?</font>

728
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,451
<font color="yellow">I mean the Je Soo Ho I know?</font>

729
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,651
<font color="yellow">Am I not allowed to do that?</font>

730
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:01,151
<font color="yellow">I wish your mother saw them.</font>

731
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:03,621
<font color="yellow">- It's too bad. - You little...</font>

732
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:08,491
<font color="yellow">Did I just see you smile?</font>

733
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,821
<font color="yellow">You're a pervert.</font>

734
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,821
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui keeps rejecting you, so you must be heartbroken.</font>

735
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:15,651
<font color="yellow">Do you enjoy pain?</font>

736
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:19,291
<font color="yellow">Waiting for a train that will never arrive is a curse,</font>

737
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:21,491
<font color="yellow">but waiting for a train that will arrive eventually...</font>

738
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:23,451
<font color="yellow">is a blessing.</font>

739
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:25,721
<font color="yellow">I need to use the washroom.</font>

740
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:27,221
<font color="yellow">I think I'm going to vomit.</font>

741
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,121
<font color="yellow">Are you writing a novel now? You didn't study literature.</font>

742
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:31,251
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

743
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:32,821
<font color="yellow">I'm getting this feeling.</font>

744
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:35,291
<font color="yellow">It feels almost as if the volcanic magma is...</font>

745
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,721
<font color="yellow">bubbling up from the bottom of my heart.</font>

746
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:41,251
<font color="yellow">Who are you? I don't think you're Je Soo Ho.</font>

747
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:50,391
<font color="yellow">Hey! Calm down. Calm down first.</font>

748
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:51,891
<font color="yellow">Calm down and talk in a deeper voice.</font>

749
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:54,691
<font color="yellow">Je Soo Ho speaking.</font>

750
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:57,251
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

751
00:51:58,951 --> 00:52:00,021
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

752
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:05,421
<font color="yellow">You got rejected once again.</font>

753
00:52:06,151 --> 00:52:07,551
<font color="yellow">You're getting a feeling? Whatever.</font>

754
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:09,951
<font color="yellow">She wants to have lunch tomorrow.</font>

755
00:52:10,991 --> 00:52:13,691
<font color="yellow">- Yes! - Yes!</font>

756
00:52:13,691 --> 00:52:16,591
<font color="yellow">(Je Soo Ho)</font>

757
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:21,851
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

758
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,991
<font color="yellow">unblock all blockages...</font>

759
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:27,351
<font color="yellow">and untangle all knots.</font>

760
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,291
<font color="yellow">- What's that now? - You need to come with me.</font>

761
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:42,521
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything.</font>

762
00:52:42,721 --> 00:52:46,191
<font color="yellow">If you want to open your mouth, just say, "Yes. That's right."</font>

763
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:47,651
<font color="yellow">That's all you can say.</font>

764
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:49,221
<font color="yellow">What's this nonsense about?</font>

765
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:51,851
<font color="yellow">If you say no, I'll divorce you!</font>

766
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,391
<font color="yellow">"Hi. Well, what do you feel like eating?"</font>

767
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:18,921
<font color="yellow">"Sure! Fish sounds good."</font>

768
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:21,391
<font color="yellow">"Can you tell this shirt is new?"</font>

769
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:23,651
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with the shoulders?</font>

770
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:25,451
<font color="yellow">Was this always small like this?</font>

771
00:53:26,451 --> 00:53:27,521
<font color="yellow">Which side is the front?</font>

772
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:34,991
<font color="yellow">I just put on what I always wear.</font>

773
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:38,691
<font color="yellow">Why does my face look so dark today?</font>

774
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:39,791
<font color="yellow">Love</font>

775
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:40,821
<font color="yellow">I should take a shower again.</font>

776
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:44,751
<font color="yellow">Goodness! What should I wear?</font>

777
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:50,551
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui!</font>

778
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:53,821
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

779
00:53:54,221 --> 00:53:55,351
<font color="yellow">- I... - I...</font>

780
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,621
<font color="yellow">finally understood the theory of relativity.</font>

781
00:53:58,491 --> 00:54:00,091
<font color="yellow">From last night to this morning,</font>

782
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:01,851
<font color="yellow">each minute felt like an hour.</font>

783
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:04,621
<font color="yellow">But the hour it took me to get here felt like a minute.</font>

784
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:07,751
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm looking at you, it feels as if time has stopped.</font>

785
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:10,591
<font color="yellow">- Actually... - Let's talk inside.</font>

786
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:11,651
<font color="yellow">- Wait... - Soo Ho!</font>

787
00:54:18,051 --> 00:54:19,851
<font color="yellow">Have a good time with your parents.</font>

788
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:24,751
<font color="yellow">- I'll get going now. - Stay and eat with us.</font>

789
00:54:24,851 --> 00:54:26,121
<font color="yellow">It's not like we don't know each other.</font>

790
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:52,791
<font color="yellow">It's been so long since our family last gathered like this.</font>

791
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:54,991
<font color="yellow">The last time was when we went out for pork barbecue...</font>

792
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,091
<font color="yellow">before you went to the States when you were 11.</font>

793
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:06,151
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

794
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:08,221
<font color="yellow">That means it's been 20 years.</font>

795
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:12,251
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

796
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:14,991
<font color="yellow">Now that we've gathered like this,</font>

797
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:17,721
<font color="yellow">we should let go of all misunderstandings...</font>

798
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:19,621
<font color="yellow">as well as each other's mistakes.</font>

799
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:24,891
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

800
00:55:26,091 --> 00:55:27,451
<font color="yellow">Your father...</font>

801
00:55:27,651 --> 00:55:30,621
<font color="yellow">hasn't had any alcohol recently. He has completely quit drinking.</font>

802
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:34,091
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

803
00:55:38,121 --> 00:55:40,451
<font color="yellow">What's your problem? You have that disapproving look in your eyes,</font>

804
00:55:40,551 --> 00:55:41,951
<font color="yellow">and you're sitting with your arms crossed.</font>

805
00:55:42,751 --> 00:55:43,991
<font color="yellow">Are you my father or what?</font>

806
00:55:46,991 --> 00:55:48,091
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

807
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:50,191
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho, please.</font>

808
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:52,021
<font color="yellow">It's been 20 years.</font>

809
00:55:52,221 --> 00:55:53,421
<font color="yellow">Go! Just go.</font>

810
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:56,851
<font color="yellow">Until when do your parents have to beg you so desperately?</font>

811
00:55:57,491 --> 00:55:59,721
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this? Bo Nui is here, too.</font>

812
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:09,221
<font color="yellow">- Why did you do that? - Do what?</font>

813
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:10,851
<font color="yellow">Be clear.</font>

814
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:12,591
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

815
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:14,951
<font color="yellow">did you throw a seven-year-old into the sea?</font>

816
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:19,221
<font color="yellow">That's how you learn swimming. You weren't good enough.</font>

817
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:21,891
<font color="yellow">Why are you blaming it on me?</font>

818
00:56:22,951 --> 00:56:24,021
<font color="yellow">Do you know that I can't...</font>

819
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:26,991
<font color="yellow">even go near water ever since that day?</font>

820
00:56:32,491 --> 00:56:35,351
<font color="yellow">Are you aware that even just the smell of sea nauseates me?</font>

821
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:39,591
<font color="yellow">You run a fishery with water everywhere...</font>

822
00:56:40,221 --> 00:56:41,351
<font color="yellow">and ask me why I don't visit you.</font>

823
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:45,991
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

824
00:56:47,151 --> 00:56:49,551
<font color="yellow">Are you expecting me to beg you on my knees?</font>

825
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:52,751
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he wants to win against his parents thinking he's smarter.</font>

826
00:56:53,851 --> 00:56:55,521
<font color="yellow">You've always been like that even as a kid.</font>

827
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,321
<font color="yellow">Even when you were little,</font>

828
00:56:57,421 --> 00:56:59,191
<font color="yellow">you talked like a know-it-all.</font>

829
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:01,421
<font color="yellow">How arrogant!</font>

830
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,251
<font color="yellow">I was just a kid.</font>

831
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:11,021
<font color="yellow">The ocean and dark nights frightened me.</font>

832
00:57:12,591 --> 00:57:15,351
<font color="yellow">I was just a child who was scared of strangers touching me,</font>

833
00:57:15,451 --> 00:57:16,491
<font color="yellow">laughing at me and watching me.</font>

834
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:20,451
<font color="yellow">You two are the ones...</font>

835
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:23,151
<font color="yellow">who didn't think of me as a kid.</font>

836
00:57:27,691 --> 00:57:28,721
<font color="yellow">That little...</font>

837
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:43,221
<font color="yellow">Do not arrange things like this ever again.</font>

838
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:46,251
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is ridiculous.</font>

839
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:52,351
<font color="yellow">Mr Je.</font>

840
00:57:55,991 --> 00:57:58,651
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I should've told you beforehand.</font>

841
00:58:00,091 --> 00:58:02,991
<font color="yellow">- But she said you wouldn't... - Right.</font>

842
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:04,591
<font color="yellow">You should've done so.</font>

843
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:06,521
<font color="yellow">This is only the beginning.</font>

844
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:09,951
<font color="yellow">You told them about how hurt and wounded...</font>

845
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:11,191
<font color="yellow">you were as a kid.</font>

846
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:14,421
<font color="yellow">- From now on... - Who do you think angered me most?</font>

847
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:16,821
<font color="yellow">It's you, Bo Nui.</font>

848
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:19,651
<font color="yellow">I know I've been chasing you.</font>

849
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:21,991
<font color="yellow">Did you think you could treat me however you want?</font>

850
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,751
<font color="yellow">Did you think you have such right?</font>

851
00:58:25,051 --> 00:58:26,151
<font color="yellow">I was sad for you.</font>

852
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:30,291
<font color="yellow">The fact that your heart has hardened...</font>

853
00:58:31,051 --> 00:58:33,351
<font color="yellow">- ached my heart. - How can you lie to me, though?</font>

854
00:58:33,451 --> 00:58:34,751
<font color="yellow">I told you that I was going to tell you.</font>

855
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:42,291
<font color="yellow">It is true that your father was harsh on you.</font>

856
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:44,851
<font color="yellow">But you were the one with the vilest attitude there.</font>

857
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:48,221
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with opening up and offering a hand first?</font>

858
00:58:48,221 --> 00:58:49,721
<font color="yellow">That's how you love.</font>

859
00:58:50,191 --> 00:58:52,251
<font color="yellow">- If you don't even know that... - So I'm at fault again.</font>

860
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:02,221
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that's how you thought of me...</font>

861
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:04,891
<font color="yellow">and was so excited from early in the morning.</font>

862
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:10,651
<font color="yellow">I thought we were solving the same problem,</font>

863
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:12,851
<font color="yellow">but I guess I was wrong.</font>

864
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:15,651
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

865
00:59:19,251 --> 00:59:20,351
<font color="yellow">for bugging you.</font>

866
01:00:02,821 --> 01:00:06,151
<font color="yellow">(The first kiss)</font>

867
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:23,891
<font color="yellow">That was his first kiss.</font>

868
01:00:49,651 --> 01:00:51,951
<font color="yellow">(Lucky Romance)</font>

869
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:55,121
<font color="yellow">What do you want? Are you sad that I've stopped bugging you?</font>

870
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:58,391
<font color="yellow">What should I do? I think he really hates me now.</font>

871
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:01,721
<font color="yellow">My heart aches so badly for him. I like him so much.</font>

872
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:03,391
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad.</font>

873
01:01:03,551 --> 01:01:06,451
<font color="yellow">How can I miss you this much when I hate you to death?</font>

874
01:01:06,851 --> 01:01:08,891
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who didn't know how to love.</font>

875
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,021
<font color="yellow">Tell me properly. Say yes.</font>

876
01:01:12,821 --> 01:01:15,151
<font color="yellow">- Are you talking casually now? - You should as well, Bo Nui.</font>

877
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:16,591
<font color="yellow">Shall I, Soo Ho?</font>

878
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:18,321
<font color="yellow">Let's hang out a bit more.</font>

879
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:20,551
<font color="yellow">We spent the whole day together.</font>

880
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:23,721
<font color="yellow">Right. So we can hang out together for a little longer.</font>

881
01:01:23,821 --> 01:01:26,291
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, thanks for being born into this world.</font>
