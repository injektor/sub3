<font color="yellow">I don't...</font>

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,240
<font color="yellow">hate you.</font>

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,970
<font color="yellow">You're such a good person. How could I hate you?</font>

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,110
<font color="yellow">No matter what anyone says,</font>

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,270
<font color="yellow">you're...</font>

<font color="yellow">someone like that for you, as well.</font>

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,670
<font color="yellow">But I can't...</font>

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,640
<font color="yellow">and I also shouldn't.</font>

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,010
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

15
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,010
<font color="yellow">don't be sick.</font>

17
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,840
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

18

<font color="yellow">Stay with me.</font>

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,710
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

20
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,410
<font color="yellow">Move over.</font>

21
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,710
<font color="yellow">This is a dream. It's a nightmare.</font>

22
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,010

- I'm the one who should ask.</font>

<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

27
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,660
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Seung Hyeon.</font>

28
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,640
<font color="yellow">- Have you seen Dal Nim?
- Dal Nim?</font>

29
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,440
<font color="yellow">Why would you ask me?</font>

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,540
<font color="yellow">You know this is the men's room.</font>

31
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,310
<font color="yellow">I thought she might be here because she was drunk last night.</font>

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
<font color="yellow">Where could she be?</font>

33
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,410
<font color="yellow">My legs look too long.</font>

34
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,830
<font color="yellow">Really? Maybe she's taking a walk with Bo Nui.</font>

35
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,770
<font color="yellow">She left last night with Mr Je.</font>

36
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,510
<font color="yellow">My back is killing me.</font>

37
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,510
<font color="yellow">- They did?
- They threw Mr Je in the water.</font>

38
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,800
<font color="yellow">They threw Soo Ho in the water?</font>

39
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,740
<font color="yellow">He seemed very upset. No wonder why he left at that hour.</font>

40
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,410
<font color="yellow">I'll go look for Dal Nim.</font>

41
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,270
<font color="yellow">Mr Je went back to Seoul?</font>

42
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,210
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

43
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,910
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

44
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,310
<font color="yellow">Let's take this out as well.</font>

45
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,770
<font color="yellow">You promised not to include any love life, gossip or rumours.</font>

46
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,370
<font color="yellow">If you throw random questions on live broadcast,</font>

47
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,840
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to pull him out myself.
- Not even his first love?</font>

48
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,710
<font color="yellow">We'll make it sound nice.</font>

49
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,270
<font color="yellow">Make it sound nice.</font>

50
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,770
<font color="yellow">It must sound beautiful no matter what.</font>

51
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,810
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

52
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,510
<font color="yellow">First love...</font>

53
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,310
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

54
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,110
<font color="yellow">I was too young back then.</font>

55
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,080
<font color="yellow">But after seeing you again, I know for certain.</font>

56
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,270
<font color="yellow">The memories we have...</font>

57
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,970
<font color="yellow">are very special.</font>

58
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,870
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

59
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,640
<font color="yellow">They were special.</font>

60
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,770
<font color="yellow">Right? You agree, don't you?</font>

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,540
<font color="yellow">Whether it was in spring or fall and in 2004 or 2005...</font>

62
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,710
<font color="yellow">You remember every detail.</font>

63
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,110
<font color="yellow">That's what first love is about.</font>

64
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,810
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if it was love to be honest.</font>

65
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,540
<font color="yellow">I don't know what love is.</font>

66
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,770
<font color="yellow">It's true that you were once my everything.</font>

67
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
<font color="yellow">You were my everything.</font>

68
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,810
<font color="yellow">You were for me at the time.</font>

69
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
<font color="yellow">How about now?</font>

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,110
<font color="yellow">They might be looking for us. Let's go inside.</font>

71
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,440
<font color="yellow">I was his everything.</font>

72
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,470
<font color="yellow">So it's the past tense.</font>

73
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,610
<font color="yellow">It's 10 minutes before the start. Please get him on standby.</font>

74
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,070
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

75
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,340
<font color="yellow">Please don't move.</font>

76
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Gary Choi.</font>

77
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,110

78
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,140
<font color="yellow">She left to Seoul last night with Mr Je.</font>

79
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,210

<font color="yellow">Hello, I am Gary Choi, also known as Choi Geon Uk.</font>

90
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,980
<font color="yellow">Your Korean name is Choi Geon Uk.</font>

91
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,300
<font color="yellow">This is your first time to reveal it, isn't it?</font>

92
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,540
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

93
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,310
<font color="yellow">Since I was little, I've been called Gary.</font>

94
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,720
<font color="yellow">Your family background or history has never been revealed.</font>

95
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,270
<font color="yellow">So many people are curious...</font>

96
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,110
<font color="yellow">to know about it.</font>

97
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,940
<font color="yellow">That's perhaps why...</font>

98
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,450
<font color="yellow">Gary is nervous right now.</font>

99
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,590
<font color="yellow">As an icebreaker, we will show you...</font>

100

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,180

113
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,810
<font color="yellow">Where are you coming from?</font>

114

<font color="yellow">I've been watching the show in the bus.</font>

115
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,910
<font color="yellow">So where have you been?</font>

116
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,870

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,330
<font color="yellow">Something came up.</font>

120
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,600
<font color="yellow">- What came up?
- Mr Je was a little unwell.</font>

121
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,840
<font color="yellow">I had to stay beside him.</font>

122
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,010
<font color="yellow">Did he get into an accident? Or did he get a surgery?</font>

123
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,090
<font color="yellow">He really almost died, right?</font>

124
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,440
<font color="yellow">That's why you didn't answer my calls and got here just now.</font>

125
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,100
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

126
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,640
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that?</font>

127
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,040
<font color="yellow">- If he gets some rest...
- If it's not that, why would you...</font>

128
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,570
<font color="yellow">If it's not that, why would you stay with him all night?</font>

129
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about coming late.</font>

130
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,240
<font color="yellow">But a person was sick. You should understand.</font>

131
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,710
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

132
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,470
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

133
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,370
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

134
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,070
<font color="yellow">What is he to you?</font>

135
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,640
<font color="yellow">What is he to you that you're pushing me away?</font>

136
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,670
<font color="yellow">I know Bo Ra far better than he does.</font>

137
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,460
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep taking him to see her?</font>

138
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,540
<font color="yellow">Why are you upset? You are scaring me.</font>

139
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
<font color="yellow">Because I like you.</font>

140
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,170
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

141
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,270
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

142
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,510
<font color="yellow">I feel certain now that I said it.</font>

143
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,770
<font color="yellow">- Bo Nui.
- Stop it.</font>

144
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,610
<font color="yellow">I think it's your anger speaking.</font>

145
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
<font color="yellow">If you go on,</font>

146
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,100
<font color="yellow">you will regret it later.</font>

147
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,510
<font color="yellow">- No.
- I know it.</font>

148
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,910
<font color="yellow">You and I...</font>

149
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,370
<font color="yellow">We're not like that, Geon Uk.</font>

150
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
<font color="yellow">Gary.</font>

151
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,640
<font color="yellow">- You're here.
- Yes.</font>

152

153
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,340
<font color="yellow">We need to wrap it up.</font>

154
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,340
<font color="yellow">Go back in there.</font>

155
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,370
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at night.</font>

156
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,910
<font color="yellow">I mean I will see you later.</font>

157
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,270
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho! Soo Ho!</font>

158
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,180
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho, I am here! Soo Ho!</font>

159
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,410
<font color="yellow">What happened to him? Soo Ho!</font>

160
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,700
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho! Soo Ho!</font>

161
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,110
<font color="yellow">I told you to call before coming.</font>

162
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,070
<font color="yellow">You are alive! Gosh, my darling Soo Ho.</font>

163
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,620
<font color="yellow">I heard you fell in the water.</font>

164
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,870
<font color="yellow">My heart was throbbing that I almost died on the way here.</font>

165
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,570
<font color="yellow">By the way, why are you so okay?</font>

166
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,010
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

167
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,610
<font color="yellow">You even ate?</font>

168
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,870
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

169
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,940
<font color="yellow">Did you stay up all night with Bo Nui?</font>

170
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,930
<font color="yellow">- Because I like you.
- No.</font>

171
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,110
<font color="yellow">What is he to you?</font>

172
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,940
<font color="yellow">What is he to you that you're pushing me away?</font>

173
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,870
<font color="yellow">You're in love.</font>

174
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,650
<font color="yellow">You miss her when she's not around and rely on her when you're sick.</font>

175
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,910
<font color="yellow">You want to stay with her a little longer...</font>

176
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,810
<font color="yellow">that you keep searching for her.</font>

177
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,440
<font color="yellow">Look at you. You're not denying it.</font>

178
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,930
<font color="yellow">This is just unbelievable.</font>

179
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,410
<font color="yellow">I raised a tiger.</font>

180
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,640
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you text her?</font>

181
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,070
<font color="yellow">About the next date?</font>

182
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,870
<font color="yellow">You didn't text, call or chat with her at all?</font>

183
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,510
<font color="yellow">Hey! You have to move your boat when the tide is rising!</font>

184
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,910
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra, what am I supposed to do?</font>

185
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,710
<font color="yellow">(Mr Je)</font>

186
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,140
<font color="yellow">What are you doing later today?</font>

187
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,940
<font color="yellow">(To Mr Je)</font>

188
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,850
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling?</font>

189
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,210
<font color="yellow">(How are you feeling?)</font>

190
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,610
<font color="yellow">You idiot!</font>

191
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,900
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't send these!</font>

192
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,630
<font color="yellow">You told me to send her emoticons!</font>

193
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,240
<font color="yellow">Not these.</font>

194
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,610
<font color="yellow">Be more charming. Send her a heart emoticon.</font>

195
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,140
<font color="yellow">Don't you know about those dancing characters?</font>

196
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,110
<font color="yellow">- What are the fingers mean?
- Hi.</font>

197
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,610
<font color="yellow">- How about this one with a turban?
- It's smiling.</font>

198
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,490
<font color="yellow">Tell me honestly.</font>

199
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,280
<font color="yellow">You lied about your IQ, right?</font>

200
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,000
<font color="yellow">Gosh... See? There's no reply.</font>

201
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,090
<font color="yellow">After three minutes, it's time to send a new message.</font>

202
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,650
<font color="yellow">But it's already been five minutes, and she's not replying.</font>

203
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,610
<font color="yellow">She ignored it. What should you do?</font>

204
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,710
<font color="yellow">I will text her for you.</font>

205
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
<font color="yellow">For some reason,</font>

206
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,440
<font color="yellow">you look strangely excited.</font>

207
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,260
<font color="yellow">You should go on date with that wit.</font>

208
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,510
<font color="yellow">Stop riding the bike every single day.</font>

209
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,770
<font color="yellow">Doesn't your bottom hurt?</font>

210
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,160
<font color="yellow">- Go.
- I'm sorry.</font>

211
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,540
<font color="yellow">- Just get out.
- Let's wait a little more.</font>

212
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,030
<font color="yellow">- You shouldn't have said that.
- Gosh.</font>

213
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,310
<font color="yellow">- I can help you. Wait.
- Go.</font>

214
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,010
<font color="yellow">You received a text message.</font>

215
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,740
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Give it back.</font>

216
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,540
<font color="yellow">You poor thing.</font>

217
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,270
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better?</font>

218
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,110
<font color="yellow">See you at work on Monday.</font>

219
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,430
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui seems to be keeping you at a safe distance.</font>

220
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,170
<font color="yellow">She's too good of an employee.</font>

221
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,640
<font color="yellow">You'll probably want a drink soon. Call me.</font>

222
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,940
<font color="yellow">Actually, see you on Monday.</font>

223
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,910
<font color="yellow">The broadcasting station will give us a list of all the calls they get.</font>

224
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,540
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry.
- Thank you.</font>

225
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,170
<font color="yellow">Did Bo Nui give that to you?</font>

226
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,510
<font color="yellow">I had my suspicions.</font>

227
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,210
<font color="yellow">Since when?</font>

228
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,940
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

229
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
<font color="yellow">It's either the day I saw her again...</font>

230
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,870
<font color="yellow">or the day I waited for her all night.</font>

231
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,470
<font color="yellow">It's embarrassing that you found out.</font>

232
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,110
<font color="yellow">Are you thinking of dating her?</font>

233
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,470
<font color="yellow">Date?</font>

234
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,340
<font color="yellow">That sounds good. Shall I try that?</font>

235
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,260
<font color="yellow">- Go for it.
- I didn't expect that.</font>

236
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,940
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be against it.</font>

237
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,940
<font color="yellow">If you can break up with her after dating for a month,</font>

238
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,510
<font color="yellow">I'm all for it.</font>

239
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,200
<font color="yellow">Don't forget.</font>

240
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,840
<font color="yellow">You're Gary Choi and you have to go back.</font>

241
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,110
<font color="yellow">You have a month left to bask in your memories.</font>

242
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,240
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

243
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,510
<font color="yellow">Is Geon Uk home?</font>

244
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,360
<font color="yellow">- Is that for Gary?
- Yes.</font>

245
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,740
<font color="yellow">I feel bad I was late.</font>

246
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,640
<font color="yellow">Do you also feel bad for running away after hearing how he feels?</font>

247
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,200
<font color="yellow">Do you know about it?</font>

248
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,240
<font color="yellow">At times, I'm closer to him than his friends or family.</font>

249
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,020
<font color="yellow">I think he is confused.</font>

250
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,680
<font color="yellow">We rely on and support each other.</font>

251
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,840
<font color="yellow">That's why he is confused.</font>

252
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,310
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, people don't know what they feel.</font>

253
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,910
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

254
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,240
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about your feelings?</font>

255
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,640
<font color="yellow">For Geon Uk?</font>

256
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,210
<font color="yellow">I don't have feelings for him.</font>

257
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,100
<font color="yellow">You should've come earlier.</font>

258
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,940
<font color="yellow">Why did you come so late and upset him?</font>

259
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,410
<font color="yellow">Something came up.</font>

260
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,810
<font color="yellow">Mr Je wasn't feeling well.</font>

261
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,240
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho?</font>

262
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,330
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

263
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,840
<font color="yellow">Was he in some kind of accident?</font>

264
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
<font color="yellow">The employees played a joke on him and threw him in the pool.</font>

265
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,010
<font color="yellow">It wasn't too bad.</font>

266
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,310
<font color="yellow">Did he go to a hospital?</font>

267
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,340
<font color="yellow">- He wanted to go home.
- You should've known better!</font>

268
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,910
<font color="yellow">You should've taken him to the hospital.</font>

269
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,310
<font color="yellow">You could've at least called me.</font>

270
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,270
<font color="yellow">This situation wasn't your call. You know that?</font>

271
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you yelling at me?</font>

272
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,770
<font color="yellow">Mr Je is okay now. I took care of him all night.</font>

273
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,270
<font color="yellow">I was late because I had to make sure he fell asleep.</font>

274
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,390
<font color="yellow">There's something you don't know about.</font>

275
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,410
<font color="yellow">I know about it, too.</font>

276
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,310
<font color="yellow">The accident he was in as a child.</font>

277
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,610
<font color="yellow">How...</font>

278
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,840
<font color="yellow">do you know about it?</font>

279
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540
<font color="yellow">Did...</font>

280
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,940
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho tell you?</font>

281
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,670
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

282
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,270
<font color="yellow">I should get going.</font>

283
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,930
<font color="yellow">Why was I fighting with her?</font>

284
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,070
<font color="yellow">I have no right.</font>

285
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,010
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

286
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,040
<font color="yellow">I won't go anywhere.</font>

287
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,470
<font color="yellow">"I'll stay here with you."</font>

288
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,610
<font color="yellow">"Should we get dinner?"</font>

289
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,340
<font color="yellow">"Are you free tomorrow?"</font>

290
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,540
<font color="yellow">That sounds better.</font>

291
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,470
<font color="yellow">Are you free tomorrow?</font>

292
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,910
<font color="yellow">(To Shim Bo Nui)</font>

293
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,500
<font color="yellow">(From Shim Bo Nui)</font>

294
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,510
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

295
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,570
<font color="yellow">"If you don't have any plans,"</font>

296

<font color="yellow">"should we get dinner?"</font>

297
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,240
<font color="yellow">"If you're free, should we get dinner?"</font>

298
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,540
<font color="yellow">Let's get dinner if you're free.</font>

299
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,840
<font color="yellow">I have plans.</font>

300
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,700
<font color="yellow">She's always busy. Why is she so busy?</font>

301
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,710
<font color="yellow">Should I go see her?</font>

302
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,840
<font color="yellow">What should I tell her then? I can't say I missed her.</font>

303
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,810
<font color="yellow">Ryang Ha?</font>

304
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,540
<font color="yellow">It's Seol Hui.</font>

305
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,710
<font color="yellow">I can't talk right now.</font>

306
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,040
<font color="yellow">Is someone crying?</font>

307
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,520
<font color="yellow">It's a goat. Let's talk later unless it's urgent.</font>

308
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,170
<font color="yellow">It's about Soo Ho.</font>

309
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,740
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone so worried about him?</font>

310
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,920
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

311
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,940
<font color="yellow">He's fine. Don't worry. I'll talk to you later.</font>

312
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,110
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

313
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,560
<font color="yellow">I've been saving myself...</font>

314
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,900
<font color="yellow">for the past 26 years.</font>

315
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,940
<font color="yellow">How could such an annoying guy like him...</font>

316
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,040
<font color="yellow">be the man I spent my first night with?</font>

317
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,830
<font color="yellow">Stop crying. I didn't do anything to you.</font>

318
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,560
<font color="yellow">Listen, Dal Nim. Let's make this clear.</font>

319
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,010
<font color="yellow">You were the one who came to my room.</font>

320
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,770
<font color="yellow">Delete everything about last night from your memory.</font>

321
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,870
<font color="yellow">I'm here to tell you we can't be together.</font>

322
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,640
<font color="yellow">It was the opportunity of my life.</font>

323
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,910
<font color="yellow">Are you shooting a drama? Do you have a camera hidden?</font>

324
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,110
<font color="yellow">The drive back to Seoul with him...</font>

325
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,210
<font color="yellow">Just the two of them...</font>

326
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,040
<font color="yellow">I should've been the one leaving with him.</font>

327
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,640
<font color="yellow">You're finally admitting that you like Soo Ho.</font>

328
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,840
<font color="yellow">Try not to speak to me from now on.</font>

329
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,370
<font color="yellow">Should I tell you something about Soo Ho?</font>

330
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,920
<font color="yellow">- Tell me about it.
- You're a turn off.</font>

331
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,940
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

332
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,530
<font color="yellow">Before I say anything,</font>

333
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,910
<font color="yellow">tell everyone here that nothing happened between us.</font>

334
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,640
<font color="yellow">- Look.
- I spent my first night...</font>

335
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,140
<font color="yellow">with this man sitting here.</font>

336
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,010
<font color="yellow">Are you running away again?</font>

337
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,940
<font color="yellow">Did you see me?</font>

338
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,630
<font color="yellow">Should I leave if I'm making you uncomfortable?</font>

339
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,740
<font color="yellow">No, stay here.</font>

340
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,340
<font color="yellow">Is she not at home?</font>

341
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,370
<font color="yellow">(Mr Je)</font>

342
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,140
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialled is not available at this moment.</font>

343
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,870
<font color="yellow">Please call again.</font>

344
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,100
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

345
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,270
<font color="yellow">I'm taking this for later.</font>

346
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,570
<font color="yellow">You always miss the people you like.</font>

347
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,350
<font color="yellow">- Geon Uk.
- I'm sorry for yelling at you.</font>

348
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,470
<font color="yellow">It wasn't cool, was it?</font>

349
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,540
<font color="yellow">Geon Uk.</font>

350
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,790
<font color="yellow">- I...
- Don't say anything.</font>

351
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,070
<font color="yellow">I haven't tried anything yet.</font>

352
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,240
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do my very best to impress you and open your heart.</font>

353
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,770
<font color="yellow">I want you to answer after I try everything.</font>

354
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,810
<font color="yellow">With that said,</font>

355
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,540
<font color="yellow">if you're free tomorrow,</font>

356
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,110
<font color="yellow">let's go on a date.</font>

357
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,610
<font color="yellow">Geon Uk!</font>

358
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,410
<font color="yellow">Yes. Smile like that.</font>

359
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,140
<font color="yellow">That's all I need.</font>

360
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,410
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

361
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,240
<font color="yellow">Why is she not coming?</font>

362
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,940
<font color="yellow">I was going to go after giving her the photos.</font>

363
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,710
<font color="yellow">(I'm at the park. I have something to give you. Answer the phone.)</font>

364
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
<font color="yellow">I am at the park.</font>

365
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,210
<font color="yellow">I have something to give you.</font>

366
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,810
<font color="yellow">Answer the phone.</font>

367
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,240
<font color="yellow">(Mr Je)</font>

368
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,270
<font color="yellow">It's for the better.</font>

369
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,870
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

370
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,610
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

371
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,140
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

372
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,470
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to sleep all night.</font>

373
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,540
<font color="yellow">My head was about to explode.</font>

374
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

375
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
<font color="yellow">And I can't erase this.</font>

376
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
<font color="yellow">If I erase this,</font>

377
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,170
<font color="yellow">the memory from the night with you...</font>

378
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,140
<font color="yellow">will probably be erased, too.</font>

379
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,310
<font color="yellow">So I can't erase it.</font>

380
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,720
<font color="yellow">I know it's impossible.</font>

381
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,320
<font color="yellow">I know that these letters exist physically...</font>

382
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,740
<font color="yellow">and have no contact with flowing time. I know that.</font>

383
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,310
<font color="yellow">But it's just how I feel.</font>

384
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

385
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,810
<font color="yellow">You don't make sense...</font>

386
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,130
<font color="yellow">no matter how many times I redo the calculations.</font>

387
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,640
<font color="yellow">No function can solve you. So you are really a bug.</font>

388
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,930
<font color="yellow">You are messing up my head, my life and my everything.</font>

389
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,940
<font color="yellow">But I...</font>

390
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,840
<font color="yellow">don't want to kill that bug.</font>

391
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
<font color="yellow">I want it...</font>

392
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,870
<font color="yellow">to stay in my head.</font>

393
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,140
<font color="yellow">What should I do about this?</font>

394
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
<font color="yellow">Should I kill it?</font>

395
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,210
<font color="yellow">Or not?</font>

396
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,470
<font color="yellow">You barged in early in the morning. What are you talking about?</font>

397
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,040
<font color="yellow">Go. Okay?</font>

398
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,910
<font color="yellow">Did you get dumped?</font>

399
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,510
<font color="yellow">When the first serve fails, there's the second.</font>

400
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,210
<font color="yellow">When I lose on the first set, I get to try again on the second set.</font>

401
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

402
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,910
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

403
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,210
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

404
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,170
<font color="yellow">What? Both of them confessed at the same time?</font>

405
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,340
<font color="yellow">How can this happen when my love is a thorn path?</font>

406
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,370
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

407
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,370
<font color="yellow">I am so happy for you!</font>

408
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,910
<font color="yellow">That's so good to hear!</font>

409
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,770
<font color="yellow">It's Gary, right?</font>

410
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,940
<font color="yellow">You will be punished if you lie.</font>

411
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,600
<font color="yellow">When we were at the workshop,</font>

412
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
<font color="yellow">he kept calling and looked for you.</font>

413
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,360
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it!</font>

414
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
<font color="yellow">He will soon stop.</font>

415
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,670
<font color="yellow">He has to go back to Canada anyway.</font>

416
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,610
<font color="yellow">Who's the other one?</font>

417
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,740
<font color="yellow">Who would compete against the top of the human race?</font>

418
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
<font color="yellow">It's someone you don't know.</font>

419
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,210
<font color="yellow">Do you think I don't know about your small social circle?</font>

420
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,870
<font color="yellow">It's him, isn't it?</font>

421
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,240
<font color="yellow">It's the guy who keeps touching you gently like summer breeze.</font>

422
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,940
<font color="yellow">It will only last for a while.</font>

423
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,740
<font color="yellow">When it passes,</font>

424
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,910
<font color="yellow">I will remember and thank how warm that breeze was.</font>

425
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,140
<font color="yellow">I will remember it with a smile.</font>

426
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,110
<font color="yellow">That's more than enough for me.</font>

427
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,810
<font color="yellow">Don't be stupid.</font>

428
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,240
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard it is for a man and a woman to feel the same?</font>

429
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,940
<font color="yellow">Just go with the flow.</font>

430
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,570
<font color="yellow">Ride the wind and go to him.</font>

431
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,910
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

432
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,140
<font color="yellow">Just give me tips on how to reject a man.</font>

433
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,270
<font color="yellow">You're so foolish.</font>

434
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,870
<font color="yellow">How can you ask me that when I've only been on one-sided love?</font>

435
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,670
<font color="yellow">I've never rejected a man!</font>

436
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,940
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

437
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,440
<font color="yellow">Stop teasing me.</font>

438
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,910
<font color="yellow">You are a bad girl.</font>

439
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,590
<font color="yellow">Hi, Soo Ho.</font>

440
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,820
<font color="yellow">It works. Bye.</font>

441
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,910
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

442
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,330
<font color="yellow">I was checking if it's broken.</font>

443
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,770
<font color="yellow">Call me right back.</font>

444
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,360
<font color="yellow">- I think I can't receive calls.
- Don't torture me.</font>

445
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,240
<font color="yellow">- Just call Bo Nui.
- No.</font>

446
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

447
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,610
<font color="yellow">I don't need it. I'm good.</font>

448
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,440
<font color="yellow">I am a sports agent, you know?</font>

449
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,050
<font color="yellow">I know all about diet and dietary supplements.</font>

450
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,780
<font color="yellow">Use your knowledge to take care of Gary. I'm okay.</font>

451
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,840
<font color="yellow">I think Gary needs Bo Nui more than me.</font>

452
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,610
<font color="yellow">Do you know?</font>

453
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,510
<font color="yellow">- They...
- Don't tell me.</font>

454
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it.</font>

455
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

456
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,370
<font color="yellow">You don't like talking about other people.</font>

457
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,840
<font color="yellow">My bad.</font>

458
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,240
<font color="yellow">I like her.</font>

459
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,110
<font color="yellow">That's why.</font>

460
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,540
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

461
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,640
<font color="yellow">You're mistaken.</font>

462
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,370
<font color="yellow">You said that you don't know what love is.</font>

463
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,840
<font color="yellow">I'll have to find out if it's love or not.</font>

464
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
<font color="yellow">Are you two...</font>

465
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,170
<font color="yellow">already going out?</font>

466
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,010
<font color="yellow">- Not yet.
- Okay.</font>

467
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
<font color="yellow">That's all I need to know.</font>

468
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,110
<font color="yellow">I should get going.</font>

469
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,670
<font color="yellow">Okay, bye.</font>

470
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,570
<font color="yellow">Am I being punished for hurting you?</font>

471
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,240
<font color="yellow">You may be shaken for a while.</font>

472
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,610
<font color="yellow">It took me too long to come back.</font>

473
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,740
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

474
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,470
<font color="yellow">It's me, Seol Hui.</font>

475
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,910
<font color="yellow">I was everything to you.</font>

476
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,410
<font color="yellow">Don't get sick. It hurts to see you like that.</font>

477
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,280
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

478
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,240
<font color="yellow">We have to check the employee pass, visitor's pass, barcode and iris?</font>

479
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,160
<font color="yellow">Don't you think that's much?</font>

480
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,810
<font color="yellow">Security is everything when it comes to IT companies.</font>

481
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,810
<font color="yellow">Did you go over all the duties for the night shift?</font>

482
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,470
<font color="yellow">Of course I did.</font>

483
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,640
<font color="yellow">People used to call me Mr Meticulous.</font>

484
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,600
<font color="yellow">I wrote it down right here.</font>

485
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,840
<font color="yellow">There is a short man that comes here drunk...</font>

486
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
<font color="yellow">between 11pm and 1am.</font>

487
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,040
<font color="yellow">That's Mr Je's father. Don't let him in.</font>

488
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,470
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for Mr Je.</font>

489
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,910
<font color="yellow">No wonder why he's so sensitive.</font>

490
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,900
<font color="yellow">Our personalities are formed during our early childhood.</font>

491
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,460
<font color="yellow">He stops his own father from visiting his office...</font>

492
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,650
<font color="yellow">- He's here.
- Hello.</font>

493
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,740
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

494
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,010
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

495
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,810
<font color="yellow">- How do you find the work?
- Yes?</font>

496
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,200
<font color="yellow">Zeze Factory is like a paradise.</font>

497
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,310
<font color="yellow">- It's nice.
- I see.</font>

498
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,810
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

499
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,330
<font color="yellow">If you run into people you know,</font>

500
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,410
<font color="yellow">you should tell them how nice this place is.</font>

501
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,610
<font color="yellow">To Bo Nui?</font>

502
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,370
<font color="yellow">I was talking about all the employees here.</font>

503
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,040
<font color="yellow">- Okay, I'll also tell Bo Nui.
- I mean...</font>

504
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,940
<font color="yellow">I guess that includes her.</font>

505
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,930
<font color="yellow">You do what you have to do. Have a nice day.</font>

506
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,040
<font color="yellow">You, too!</font>

507
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,570
<font color="yellow">Something's definitely going on between them.</font>

508
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,710
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

509
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,540
<font color="yellow">Why hasn't he pushed the button?</font>

510
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,810
<font color="yellow">Aren't you getting in, Mr Je?</font>

511
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,910
<font color="yellow">Are you still upset?</font>

512
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,870
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- About the joke we played on you...</font>

513
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,500
<font color="yellow">Let's talk in the office.</font>

514
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,040
<font color="yellow">- Close the door and go up.
- Okay.</font>

515
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,940
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

516
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,010
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

517
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,280
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

518
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,070
<font color="yellow">It's 28 hours and 15 minutes.</font>

519
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,310
<font color="yellow">I mean us.</font>

520
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,310
<font color="yellow">It's been 28 hours and 15 minutes since I last saw you.</font>

521
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,940
<font color="yellow">Don't you...</font>

522
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,840
<font color="yellow">have anything to tell me?</font>

523
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,140
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

524
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,740
<font color="yellow">He can't still be upset.</font>

525
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,010
<font color="yellow">"Let's talk in the office."</font>

526
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,250
<font color="yellow">That's what he said.</font>

527
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,400
<font color="yellow">You idiots should all have resignations prepared.</font>

528
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,900
<font color="yellow">It was for the unity of our team.</font>

529
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,170
<font color="yellow">Can't the president...</font>

530
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,410
<font color="yellow">sacrifice himself for that purpose? No, he can't.</font>

531
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,000
<font color="yellow">Should we write our resignations by hand?</font>

532
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,660
<font color="yellow">We should type it out.</font>

533
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,940
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to handwrite it.
- Gosh.</font>

534
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,170
<font color="yellow">- Good morning.
- Bo Nui.</font>

535
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,580
<font color="yellow">Was Mr Je very upset that day?</font>

536
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,870
<font color="yellow">- Is he mad at us?
- Why would you think I'm mad?</font>

537
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,430
<font color="yellow">The people who ganged up and threw you in the pool...</font>

538
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,040
<font color="yellow">are handing in their resignations.</font>

539
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

540
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,110
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

541
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,710
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

542
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,200
<font color="yellow">Are you making it a habit to hand in your resignation?</font>

543
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,310
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

544
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,810
<font color="yellow">We have four weeks left until the beta test.</font>

545
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,740
<font color="yellow">Do you have the schedule ready?</font>

546
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,700
<font color="yellow">I'll bring it to you before lunch.</font>

547
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,580
<font color="yellow">Did you monitor Gary's broadcast?</font>

548
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,240
<font color="yellow">Oh, I forgot.</font>

549
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,540
<font color="yellow">I want you to remember where you work.</font>

550
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,610
<font color="yellow">You don't need to work too hard. Just do...</font>

551
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you should do a proper job?</font>

552
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,610
<font color="yellow">I have high expectations.</font>

553
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,340
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

554
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,280
<font color="yellow">I'm counting on you.</font>

555
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,800
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

556
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,870
<font color="yellow">- Falling into water must have...
- He must have gone crazy.</font>

557
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,810
<font color="yellow">- His brain isn't...
- It isn't functioning right.</font>

558
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,300
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, what happened?</font>

559
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,570
<font color="yellow">Did you turn both of them down?</font>

560
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,010
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to.</font>

561
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,110
<font color="yellow">I don't have the luxury to date.</font>

562
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,410
<font color="yellow">How could you give up so easily?</font>

563
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,510
<font color="yellow">I can never do that.</font>

564
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,310
<font color="yellow">I spent my first night with this man sitting here.</font>

565
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,070
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

566
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,430
<font color="yellow">This is how you get Soo Ho interested in you.</font>

567
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,830
<font color="yellow">Be quiet and write it down.</font>

568
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,840
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho is...</font>

569
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,540
<font color="yellow">Be objective.</font>

570
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,210
<font color="yellow">Be cold.</font>

571
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,940
<font color="yellow">Be confident.</font>

572
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,840
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

573
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,610
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

574
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,370
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je!
- Gosh!</font>

575
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,780
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many times I knocked on your door?</font>

576
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,840
<font color="yellow">- You knocked?
- Here's the schedule.</font>

577
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,440
<font color="yellow">I need your approval.</font>

578
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,610
<font color="yellow">It's hot in here.</font>

579
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,710
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim.</font>

580
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
<font color="yellow">It's hot in here, isn't it?</font>

581
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,910
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why it's so hot.</font>

582
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,130
<font color="yellow">This is all because of global warming.</font>

583
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,700
<font color="yellow">It's due to environmental pollution.</font>

584
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,870
<font color="yellow">I'm part of an environmental movement. Drink this.</font>

585
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,280
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

586
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,010
<font color="yellow">It had trash on it.</font>

587
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,710
<font color="yellow">He's so sweet.</font>

588
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,540
<font color="yellow">Where is my other half?</font>

589
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,260
<font color="yellow">You scared me!</font>

590
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,410
<font color="yellow">- I think it really worked!
- Let go of me.</font>

591
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,110
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

592
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,940
<font color="yellow">You told me to be objective, cold and confident.</font>

593
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,110
<font color="yellow">It worked.</font>

594
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,010
<font color="yellow">That can't be true.</font>

595
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,440
<font color="yellow">This is a historic day.</font>

596
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,840
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

597
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,470
<font color="yellow">I was coaching her to get dumped.</font>

598
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,640
<font color="yellow">She came back crazy</font>

599
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,740
<font color="yellow">She's insane</font>

600
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,310
<font color="yellow">Make sure you don't leave anything out.</font>

601
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,040
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

602
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,310
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll call again later. Bye.</font>

603
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,940
<font color="yellow">Hi, Bo Nui.</font>

604
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,670
<font color="yellow">I heard you wanted to see me.</font>

605
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,710
<font color="yellow">Have you had lunch?</font>

606
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,510
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about the other day.</font>

607
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,670
<font color="yellow">I was so worried when I heard Soo Ho was sick.</font>

608
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,310
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have been so sensitive.</font>

609
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

610
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,940
<font color="yellow">The same goes for me. I'm sorry.</font>

611
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,470
<font color="yellow">I hope you and Gary work out.</font>

612
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,820
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

613
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,270
<font color="yellow">I know how he feels as I'm in a similar situation.</font>

614
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,670
<font color="yellow">Similar situation?</font>

615
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,840
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

616
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,470
<font color="yellow">I want to start over with Soo Ho.</font>

617
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,740
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho told me that I was his everything.</font>

618
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,570
<font color="yellow">It was the same for me.</font>

619

621
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,840
<font color="yellow">This is a secret between you and me.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll tell everyone else later if it works out.</font>

623

- Yes.</font>

624

- Yes.</font>

632
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,240
<font color="yellow">Is that why she got mad at me?</font>

633
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,540

00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,540
<font color="yellow">I heard that...</font>

772
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,010
<font color="yellow">they almost got into an accident earlier.</font>

773
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,670
<font color="yellow">I think your father has a misunderstanding about Mr Ahn.</font>

774
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,040
<font color="yellow">No reason or misunderstanding...</font>

775
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,040
<font color="yellow">can justify this.</font>

776
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:01,500
<font color="yellow">Don't worry! I told you to just leave it to me.</font>

777
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,040
<font color="yellow">No, I should finish it.</font>

778
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,540
<font color="yellow">- Please go in.
- Goodness.</font>

779
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,700
<font color="yellow">I'll get going, too. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.</font>

780
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,370
<font color="yellow">- All right. Get home safely.
- Bye.</font>

781
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,140
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, you should go home.</font>

782
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,010
<font color="yellow">I'll also head home after throwing this away.</font>

783
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,250
<font color="yellow">Let's do it together.</font>

784
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,800
<font color="yellow">Gosh, there's no need.</font>

785
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,470
<font color="yellow">I can do it alone.</font>

786
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,370
<font color="yellow">Goodness, give it to me.</font>

787
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,010
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

788
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,640
<font color="yellow">I told you I can carry it.</font>

789
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,370
<font color="yellow">Forget it all.</font>

790
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:40,940
<font color="yellow">Forget what you just saw...</font>

791
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,340
<font color="yellow">and what my father did.</font>

792
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,240
<font color="yellow">Please forget all those embarrassing things you saw.</font>

793
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,540
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

794
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,370
<font color="yellow">I'll remember everything...</font>

795
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,030
<font color="yellow">from how you were considerate of me just now...</font>

796
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,370
<font color="yellow">and how you did your best to make up for what your father did.</font>

797
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,740
<font color="yellow">So please don't be embarrassed.</font>

798
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,610
<font color="yellow">It's nothing to be embarrassed of.</font>

799
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:07,140
<font color="yellow">Then can you keep doing this for me?</font>

800
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,140
<font color="yellow">Whether it's my parents...</font>

801
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,940
<font color="yellow">or my weaknesses,</font>

802
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,170
<font color="yellow">I think I will not be embarrassed if it's you.</font>

803
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,710
<font color="yellow">Mr Je.</font>

804
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:33,810
<font color="yellow">To me,</font>

805
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,510
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra comes first.</font>

806
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,240
<font color="yellow">You protect Bo Ra.</font>

807
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,540
<font color="yellow">I'll protect you.</font>

808
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:46,910
<font color="yellow">I actually...</font>

809
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,670
<font color="yellow">got a lucky charm for you.</font>

810
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,670
<font color="yellow">It's a tiger lucky charm made exclusively for you.</font>

811
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,110
<font color="yellow">I'll put it on you.</font>

812
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,310
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that I'd end up...</font>

813
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,240
<font color="yellow">giving this to you in front of this big bag of garbage. Here.</font>

814
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,310
<font color="yellow">I cannot accept this. Please don't give it to me.</font>

815
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,010
<font color="yellow">To me,</font>

816
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,410
<font color="yellow">you're just my boss and nothing more or less.</font>

817
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,770
<font color="yellow">I wanted to meet you today to tell you this.</font>

818
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

819
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,110
<font color="yellow">- Please let me go.
- You said you don't hate me.</font>

820
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,940
<font color="yellow">- I never said I like you.
- That night.</font>

821
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,800
<font color="yellow">You were sick and you also helped me before,</font>

822
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,870
<font color="yellow">so I forced myself to stay with you.</font>

823
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,340
<font color="yellow">I missed Geon Uk's broadcast because of it, so I regretted it so much.</font>

824
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,670
<font color="yellow">Did you say...</font>

825
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,710
<font color="yellow">you regretted it?</font>

826
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,770
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

827
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,610
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure...</font>

828
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,640
<font color="yellow">how you felt that night,</font>

829
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,800
<font color="yellow">- but I was upset and uncomfortable.
- Stop lying.</font>

830
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,100
<font color="yellow">For you, it's always either 0 or 1...</font>

831
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,170
<font color="yellow">and go or stop.</font>

832
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,170
<font color="yellow">I've chosen to stop.</font>

833
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,170
<font color="yellow">So please let me go.</font>

834
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:24,940
<font color="yellow">If you go now,</font>

835
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,440
<font color="yellow">I won't ask you ever again.</font>

836
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,240
<font color="yellow">You really...</font>

837
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,440
<font color="yellow">don't like me?</font>

838
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:36,670
<font color="yellow">You said I'm like a bug.</font>

839
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:38,810
<font color="yellow">A bug in your head.</font>

840
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,170
<font color="yellow">Catch it.</font>

841
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:43,940
<font color="yellow">Catch it and kill it.</font>

842
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,040
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

843
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,940
<font color="yellow">what I'm supposed to do?</font>

844

01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:20,910
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

850
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,270
<font color="yellow">(Why do you ask?)</font>

851
