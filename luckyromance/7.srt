60

61
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,660
Your company id, your ring, you're real lazy there Mr. Married Man.

62
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,440
What...was the managing director's number again?

63
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,720
- Why can't I remember?<br>- No! No! I'll go! I was just about to go!

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,250
- That's right? Go.<br>- Sorry!

65
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,560
- Run.<br>- Yes sir!

66
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,490
Why isn't he coming?!

67
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,710
You're scared aren't you. A cowardly tiger that can't even match up to a kitty.

68
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,460
Meow! Meow! Where's that damn tiger?

69
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,210
Stop this.

70
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,850
It's not your business.

71
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,270
- I said stop this!<br>- Who are you to do this. Give me that!

72
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,890
She's not dead! I checked her myself.

73
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,840
Your little sister, she's fine.

74
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,080
So what? Should I dance in joy?

75
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,120
Because she hasn't woken up.

76
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,600
That's not what I'm saying!

77
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,530
- What are you doing?<br>- I told you to stay out of it.

78
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:37,830
If you're going to help, then you should've helped when I needed you. What's the point of you doing this now?

79
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,960
<i>I begged you,</i>

80
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,210
I begged you to help me just <i>once</i>, if you just did that, if you did!—

81
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,900
If I did then what do you think would've changed!?

82
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,630
Do you still not understand?

83
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,860
This ridiculous superstitious act is over, it's past 12 and there's no full moon,

84
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,380
-so please, just logically!—<br>- Stop. I said stop!

85
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,620
What were you going to do, if you got caught by those crazy bastards, and they recorded you?

86
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,840
How did you know that?

87
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,810
- The emergency call...was that you, CEO?<br>- It was good that I did this, at least—

88
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,400
Why are you doing this to me?! CEO, what are you that you can do this to me!?

89
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,330
What about that!? What about a hidden camera, who cares!

90
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,310
There was a person's life on the line, our Bo Ra! I could've saved her.

91
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,440
Let go!

92
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,510
Let's go. The sun's not up yet, I'll fulfill that wish for you.

93
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,300

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,880
Gary?

98
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,320

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,520
Amy...

100
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,380
What are you doing not changing your clothes?

101
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,680
How long were you like this?

102
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Thirty minutes? One hour?

103
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,550
We can't do this, you should go to the sauna.

104
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,830
Calm down. This much is nothing.

105
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:01,700
I came because your voice over the phone was weird and you're out there looking so sad in front of someone else's house.

106
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,790
Do you want a can of beer?

107
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,720
Do you like Ms. Bo Nui?

108
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,530
Me?! Like Noona Bo Nui!?

109
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,470
You've been with me for so many years and you still don't know my type?

110
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,070
It's late and it was raining.

111
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,590
-And she wouldn't even pick up?<br>-Mhm.

112
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,570
She didn't go to the company dinner and didn't even come home?

113
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,980
Gary, this...

114
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,930
-She's with a boyfriend.<br>-Huh?

115
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm sure!

116
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,190
I said let go. That none of this matters anymore, I said let go!

117
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,810
Listen well. One,

118
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,030
if you don't grab a tiger then your sister will die,

119
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,670
two, you didn't do that crazy act,

120
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,740
three, your sister is fine and alive,

121
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,240
what these results show is that superstitions are wrong.

122
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,720
Sim Bo Nui, please come out of that fantasy and see...reality.

123
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,750
Reality?

124
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,690
Do you want me to tell you what reality is?

125
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,700
If I love them, they all leave. I gave my parents a funeral when I was 16.

126
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,110
There were only me and Bo Ra left in the world, but-

127
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,830
But now I have to let go of the one little sister I've got left.

128
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,500
That...

129
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,600
What do I do with that?

130
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,590
I'm so scared, it's all horrible,

131
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,680
that I'd rather die off first.

132
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,620
Every day is like stepping on thin ice and because I don't know when disaster might happen, every minute, every second is Hell!

133
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,120
This is my reality, got it?

134
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,700
She's alive today? If it's not today then it'll be tomorrow.

135
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,270
If it's not tomorrow, it'll be the day after!

136
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,140
Why in the world do you think of it like that?!

137
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,740
I'll cancel it.

138
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,290
When I said it was because of you, CEO, back then...I lied.

139
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,730
At least with that,

140
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,880
I wanted to run away from the guilt, it was all my fault.

141
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,870
Why is that your fault?!

142
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,350
It doesn't make any logical sense!

143
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,070
CEO, even if you die and come back to life, you won't understand.

144
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,590
So instead of following me, just go.

145
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,220
Again! Look at you! Walking off again!

146
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,570
Yeah I'm done with this! If I had any more patience to explain this to you, I'd be Buddha!

147
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:27,340
I've wasted my time well! I'm going too! I'm going!

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,380
No! They definitely can't!

171
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,750
I know! I know! I know no one can go in except me!

172
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,950
-You know where it is!<br>-Be quiet-bang!

173
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,370
Oh! But on a day like this,

174
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,240
they're upset you're not here!

175
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,050
If by any chance, they're in my sight,

176
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,770
whether it's overtime, penalties, or pay cuts, tell them they'll have to pay the price.

177
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,390
Hey! Hey! If I gave you a joke, then take it as a joke!

178
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,770
If you take it as education what am I supposed to do!

179
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,890
I'll leave everything in your care, <i>Hyung</i>.

180
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,890
Did you...just call me hyung?

181
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,780
I trust you, I'm hanging up.

182
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:24,130
<i>♬ Why didn't I know you? ♬</i>

183
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:33,040
<i>♬ I trusted that you would stay ♬</i>

184
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:41,510
<i> ♬ Time is thoughtlessly flowing by ♬ </i>

185
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,380
<i>♬ All that's left is late regret ♬</i>

186
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,440
Exactly what kind of life did she live? This girl...

187
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,520
Where is this?

188
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,760
My house.

189
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,810
Why am I here?

190
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,200
You should get checked up for alcohol-induced dementia.

191
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,970
You seem to comfortably forget everything when you drink.

192
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,350
Oh, I slept well.

193
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,890
<i>I'll make your wish come true.</i>

194
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,430
<i>Sim Bo Nui, let's go home.</i>

195
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,360
How did you know about the hospital?

196
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,240
How should I say I knew about it for you to stop thinking stupid things?

197
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,690
I told you yesterday. Today if not tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the day after.

198
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,280
Do you really think it's a matter of time?

199
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:18,180
I seemed to have bothered you again. I don't know why I keep doing this to you.

200
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,360
No, no, I'm okay.

201
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,590
No. There's no reason for you to be okay.

202
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,890
Because of me, you were bothered, frustrated and bewildered.

203
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,550
While you are irrational, at least you're aware of your actions.

204
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,660
Yes, you're right. Because of you, I was bothered, frustrated and bewildered.

205
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,450
- So from now on-<br>-During this time,

206
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,910
I was thankful.

207
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,190
There will be nothing like this from now on. I promise that.

208
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,120
Stay healthy.

209
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,590
What is this? This ominous respect?

210
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,820
Superstitions are a virus-no, what am I saying, superstitions are a virus.

211
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,300
I mean, if she's grateful she can just do well from now on. Why'd she say "stay healthy"?

212
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,830
Her additions and subtractions don't compute!

213
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,700
Anyway... That Sim Bo Nui. She's a weird woman.

214
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,270
What is this?

215
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,920
<i>Went to pray.</i>

216
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,980
Shaman Sir?

217
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,040
Sir Shaman!

218
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,660
Sir Shaman!

219
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,070
<i>The phone is turned off. You will be connected to voice messaging-</i>

220
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,380
Sir Shaman. What am I supposed to do?

221
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:48,230
You should tell me what I'm supposed to do now...

222
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,750
When did I get so old?

223
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:02,140
Look at all these wrinkles. It's not like I'm stressing my body but it keeps forming-oh my gosh.

224
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,180
What am I going to do about this v-line?

225
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,110
You have a lot of gray hairs too, darling.

226
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,960
Bo Nui Noona? Noona!

227
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,040
Noona!

228
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,390
Noona!

229
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,390
Geon Wook!

230
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,630
You're coming now? You didn't see me?

231
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,350
You must have come out to exercise. Go run.

232
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,060
Wait a minute. Is Bo Ra okay?

233
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,750
Yeah. She's fine.

234
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,880
Were you at the hospital all night?

235
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,420
- No. <br>- Then where-

236
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,180
You look tired. Go in.

237
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,820
Okay.

238
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,930
So. Where did you sleep?

239
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,430
With who?

240
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,150
<i>I have to sleep with that person. That's how our Bo Ra will wake up.</i>

241
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,300
There's no way that would happen.

242
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,400
Even if noona is reckless, if Je Soo Ho is Je Soo Ho, he wouldn't do such a thing.

243
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,710
But Noona is too pretty and that guy is a man too.

244
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,470
Here! Coffee is here. And for Seung Hyeon, a special size.

245
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,260
Thank you. I thought I was dying of thirst.

246
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,650
Oh Dal Ddong!

247
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,520
What did you say?

248
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,990
How are you swollen to the point where it's fascinating?

249
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,610
Did you drop anything yesterday?

250
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,650
No, I didn't.

251
00:28:53,650 --> 00:29:00,090
Oh, really? Wait a moment. It looks like you dropped your heart and left though.

252
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:00,910
<i>Mother!</i>

253
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,290
<i>No! Absolutely not. All of you go home!</i>

254
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,230
<i>Let's go together!</i><br><i>"With you my heart shakes as well"</i>

255
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,430
<i>Are we going to Je Soo Ho's house!?</i>

256
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,040
<i>Let's go to Je Soo Ho's place!</i>

257
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,890
<i>These people!</i>

258
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,010
<i>Go to the house!</i>

259
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,350
<i>Come follow me!</i>

260
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,970
<i>Third round! Let's go a third!</i>

261
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,150
<i>Hurry and leave.</i>

262
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,480
<i>Oh, that scared me. I thought I stepped on a mine or something.</i>

263
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,080
<i>What is this?</i>

264
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:36,460
<i>Who leaves their stuff around, J's story?</i>

265
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,940
Wait a minute!

266
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,190
"Though you stand furious as thunder, with the betrayal of your colleague"

267
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,260
"The solitude that came with enduring that alone"

268
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,230
Oh! Wow! These words! This must be why Zeze's storylines are so good, right?

269
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,700
That's not mine!

270
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,710
If it's not yours, why are you trying to steal it back?

271
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,160
J-Just listen to it! Listen to it. The real thing starts from here!

272
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,380
"You, who stays unmoving while the days and nights pass, my darling, the workaholic"

273
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,860
Wow!

274
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,870
"If only I could massage your stiff shoulders, how nice would that be?"

275
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,250
Oh, I'm getting chills! Chills!

276
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,640
"I don't expect any compensation in return, I'm simply grateful that I can like-"

277
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,080
-Stay still!<br>-I'll find the owner for you!

278
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,490
-I can find the owner too!<br>-No! I will!

279
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,420
Wow. Everyone wants Je Soo Ho!

280
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,330
Just take all the women in the world!

281
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:37,810
Wow, hey, I like that sentence. "You my darling, the workaholic"!

282
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,470
Oh god! That was childish. Childish poop panty childish!

283
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,080
<i>D-100</i>

284
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,630
Let's start working on the scenario now.

285
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,900
Yes! We just have to run in order!

286
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,280
We're not just running, the problem is we have to keep sprinting at 200km/h!

287
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,490
I'm so freaking thirsty!

288
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,820
Wow, the respectable Mr. Lee Hyun Bin!

289
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,250
- But, what about Bo Nui and the CEO?<br>- Don't know.

290
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:20,590
Hey, they weren't at the company dinner either and now they're late together too! What if they have something between them?

291
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,040
Oh! It's a mystery!

292
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,470
-Right?<br>-What are you talking about? CEO's already here.

293
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,850
Did she faint?

294
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,530
I mean, she slept fine all through the night!

295
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,630
Seriously, she requires so much care, making the CEO get her personally.

296
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm going to give her a stern talking to when I see her!

297
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,270
"Unexcused absence! This is absurd!"

298
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,460
Ah, you have a meeting today, right?

299
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,990
I came to see you.

300
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,340
- Where were you yesterday?<br>- Huh?

301
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,240
I'm asking where you were last night, and with whom.

302
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,350
Why are you curious about that?

303
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,960
Damn...he keeps making me ask.

304
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:39,530
Were you with Bo Nui Noona yesterday?

305
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,850
I told you. I'm no different from her younger brother.

306
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,340
As her little brother, I have to know.

307
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,090
As her little brother, ask your biological older sister Sim Bo Nui yourself!

308
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,500
I don't want to share my employee's private life with outsiders.

309
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,070
What? Right now, Noona is-!

310
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,940
Anyway, it's because something's happened.

311
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,360
It's because something's happened that she's clinging onto nonsense signs.

312
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,890
I mean, Mr. Je Soo Ho, if you're sane, you can't complain about what's right or wrong when you're facing off between men!

313
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,480
I know it's because of her little sister.

314
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,940
Noona...talked about Bo Ra, to you?

315
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,860
You talk like you're the one who knows Sim Bo Nui the best in the world, but I know what there's to know.

316
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,160
And, we'll handle whatever happens between us.

317
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,090
"We" two?

318
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,450
Anyway, I'm disappointed.

319
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,660
You meddle in the private life of the noona next door.

320
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,570
Right now, Gary seems like a puny kid from the neighborhood, that's sticking his nose in where he isn't needed.

321
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:52,800
I'm saying as a character, you're getting less charming. Then.

322
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,810
We aren't open yet, we start at 4...

323
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,750
Oppa Yeong Il, right?

324
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,170
Oppa!

325
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,210
-Are you busy?<br>-Thinking.

326
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,530
You have nothing to tell me?

327
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,370
Hm? Huh?

328
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,290
-Ugh this is no fun, I'm leaving.<br>-"Stay healthy".

329
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,860
-I'm going to be more healthy than you!<br>-What do you think that means?

330
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,430
"Stay healthy".

331
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,410
It's a positive remark!

332
00:34:54,410 --> 00:35:00,530
Bye bye! Sayonara, Jai Jien! Ahnyoung! Why? Did the hot woman tell you to stay healthy?

333
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:06,350
You were dumped! Dumped! Damn kicked off!

334
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:10,160
Ow! Ow-wait! You're being so rough with a major shareholder!

335
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,110
Wait! Wait! The kids are watching! I'm embarrassed!...Good meeting!

336
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:26,140
Moon, moon, what moon, round round round moon,

337
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,080
where have you risen? In Dede you've risen!

338
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,780
Miss Bo Nui!

339
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,430
Oh, Bo Nui!

340
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,710
I'm sorry for being late. I'm sorry.

341
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,180
Are you sick? You don't look so good.

342
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,950
I'm okay. What about the CEO?

343
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,840
He's cry-I mean...thinking?

344
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,270
Nothing's happened, right?

345
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,180
What the heck? She's fine.

346
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,850
Ms. Sim Bo Nui, please see me for a moment.

347
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,010
I'll be back.

348
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,680
- You...<br>- CEO Je. Oh, Bo Nui.

349
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,880
- Hi.<br>- Hello.

350
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,790
Did your date go well yesterday?

351
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,160
- Excuse me?<br>- Gary waited so long for you.

352
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,940
Ah, I saw him this morning.

353
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,140
-The morning?<br>-You're here for the meeting, right?

354
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:49,060
You said we'd meet today. Let's get some tea, I have something to say.

355
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,160
You don't remember? You promised me after the event yesterday!

356
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,980
Ah, seriously! Let go! Let go!

357
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,620
Oh, you're all here.

358
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,210
-Oh Je Soo Ho's first love and Je Soo Ho's bundle of luck-<br>-Hey!

359
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,770
CEO Je's too cruel to his first love.

360
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,000
I'll say this officially. She's not a first love and she isn't a bundle of luck.

361
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,450
Of course you'd say she isn't but according to my interpretations, she's your first love.

362
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,690
- Let's go. See you later.<br>- Yes.

363
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,070
- Work hard.<br>- Yes.

364
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,190
-Our bundle of luck! Bundle of luck!<br> -Stop it. Come on, hurry up.

365
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,400
Why! Why how nice is it!

366
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,620
-With your bundle of luck and your first love!

367
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,620
- It's not! She's not!<br>- Stop pushing!

368
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,120
It's so nice to see you, this is fascinating! Do you live in this neighborhood?

369
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,980
No! My son's company is this way, Zeze Factory.

370
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,300
Zeze? I know it! They have a lot of dinners here, they're regulars!

371
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,060
Is that so? Zeze's CEO is my son.

372
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,520
Wow. I see.

373
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,030
You really raised your son well.

374
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,590
Oppa, how about your kids?

375
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,960
If they're like you, they must be very smart.

376
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,670
I'm alone. I failed with my business a long time ago and we split then.

377
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:24,170
I thought it was good I didn't have a kid but now that I'm old, I regret it.

378
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:29,870
Oh, I see.

379
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,410
Then, I'll start.

380
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:51,800
What's with the dramatic intro. Someone would think we had something happen between us.

381
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,750
<i>I didn't run away from you, I ran away from myself.</i>

382
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,920
<i>I was scared. That I might keep using you.</i>

383
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,840
I didn't approach you with the purpose of the thesis.

384
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:07,160
I was just curious...

385
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,400
Who it was my dad chose instead of my older brother.

386
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,430
- Older brother?<br>- Yeah.

387
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,840
An oppa that wasn't as bright as you, but still was called a prodigy.

388
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,480
There was an accident, my dad lost a pupil that was a son,

389
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,140
and my mom was depressed with nervous breakdowns.

390
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,170
And his little sister, was caught up in guilt that wasn't necessary,

391
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,840
so she majored in physics, which didn't even fit with her aptitude.

392
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,170
Just, a predictable story.

393
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,390
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,150
I must have saved it to tell you now.

395
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:52,050
And that thesis, I took it back right away. Though you were gone because you'd already left for Korea.

396
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,350
Soo Ho, I know it's shameless but I'd like you to understand,

397
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,500
the selfish and immature me, from 2004,

398
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,750
even if it won't lead to forgiveness,

399
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,830
2005.

400
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,420
It's not 2004, it's 2005.

401
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:40,850
<i> Timing and subtitles brought to you by <br> The Lucky Team @ Viki </i>

402
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:50,320
Since I've tied one knot, it's the start again.

403
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,340
Yes! That was good!

404
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,120
Yes! Just a moment!

405
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,110
Please come in!

406
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:10,130
Huh? Ms. Dal Nim? What brings you here?

407
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,180
CEO told me to pass this on to you.

408
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,850
This...is that, right? Free Pass!

409
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,290
It's a temporary entrance pass for the project.

410
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,280
Thank you.

411
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,120
Je Soo Ho!

412
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,170
Thank you!

413
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,290
I think we need to make the size a little bigger.

414
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,060
Who put this here?

415
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,440
Oh...I think Ms. Bo Nui put that there.

416
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,040
Oh, she gave all of us one too! It blocks out electromagnetic waves,

417
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,260
and if we put thorny plants up then...

418
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,210
-What did she say? The bad things...<br>-Evil Countenance!

419
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,430
She said it'd block out that stuff.

420
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,000
- Oh yes.<br> -Where is she? Ms. Sim Bo Nui.

421
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,020
This jump and then we'll calculate it all through here.

422
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,830
And the aspects that've been modified from the initial plans.

423
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,950
What are you doing?

424
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,020
Oh, CEO!

425
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:38,780
Ah, Ms. Bo Nui had organized all the information from the first plans for IF, so I was listening to her explain that.

426
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,900
Are you trying to give up your position?

427
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,810
What? No! It's not like that!

428
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,760
Ms. Sim Bo Nui. Respond.

429
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,610
Mr. Hyun Bin, could you give us a moment.

430
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,300
Oh, yes!

431
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,930
-CEO-<br>-Are you going to say nonsense like "I'll quit" or something like that again!?

432
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,740
I just got a call from the hospital!

433
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,820
-They said patient Sim Bo Ra is really doing fine!<br>-I know.

434
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,360
I call every 10 minutes to check too.

435
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,090
I mean, for a person who knows that-are you still going to talk about evil spirits and countenances?!

436
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,000
They do exist.

437
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,390
I mean, do you not remember?!

438
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,480
That astrology, physiognomy, all of it was a sham!

439
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,490
Whether it's talisman or a thorny plant, whether it has an effect or not,

440
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,730
I'm saying I trust and depend on it, is that so bad?

441
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,620
It's bad!

442
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:46,070
I know.

443
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:51,460
Now, Ms. Sim Bo Nui, it's because you're so invested in a phenomenon that you're not accepting reality.

444
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,850
It's a psychological error!

445
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,140
CEO, by your standards, I'm filled with errors.

446
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,630
I'm afraid to clip my nails at night because I'm scared, I don't even whistle,

447
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,070
and I don't even write my name in red pen because something bad could happen.

448
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:11,480
Okay! I'll give you an orderly explanation about your error.

449
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,800
There's things called "evidence" in science, Ms. Bo Nui, I'll try to prove your faith with science.

450
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,410
Hypothesis, if you write your name in red pen, something bad happens!

451
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,040
-Don't.<br>-I wrote it.

452
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:27,370
Did something happen? The roof didn't collapse, I didn't get hit by a thunderbolt, and heart attack-!

453
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,560
It doesn't happen. My heart, is incredibly healthy.

454
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,010
Oh! I can even write my parents' names. Here...

455
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,040
Don't! I said don't!

456
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,900
Give it!

457
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,340
Why are you doing this? You really can't do this!

458
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,270
What's there to not do? My father, Mr. Je Mul Po,

459
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,760
he's anatomically healthy, his voice is loud,

460
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,840
he's very healthy, just wait and see, nothing will happen.

461
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,120
If your parents die because of you,

462
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,620
do you know how hellish that life is?

463
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,920
Ms. Sim Bo Nui...your parents...died because of you?

464
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:15,510
Thoughtless acts like these, don't ever...ever do them.

465
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,920
No, I just wanted to prove...

466
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,850
I just...

467
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:34,620
Did he go on a show or something?

468
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,920
They said there was an article-!

469
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:50,810
<i>CEO's Mother</i>

470
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,670
Hello.

471
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,710
Yes, it's me.

472
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,890
Excuse me?!

473
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,310
I mean, why would a tiny man like him be back there!

474
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:08,080
When I got the call, I was so shocked that my blood pressure just dropped!

475
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,970
He'll be okay.

476
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,910
Are you sure you don't have to give the CEO a call?

477
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,430
Don't don't! I tried calling him a couple times and then called you.

478
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,080
Still.

479
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,530
I'm sorry and grateful to you, I'll put in a good word for you to Soo Ho later.

480
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:27,090
It's okay, this is a given.

481
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,780
Honey! Honey! Honey!

482
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,170
Be quiet!

483
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,610
-Your head! Oh my gosh-what do I do, are you okay?!<br>-It's fine!

484
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:54,620
-Do you have a hole!?<br>-Move your hand! I'm fine!

485
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,970
It's a relief!

486
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,610
It's really a relief!

487
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,180
No, I'm really okay-I'm not hungry at all!

488
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,580
What are you saying! You came all the way here, of course you have to eat!

489
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,540
Sit, sit!

490
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:30,140
But how do you have such good intentions? You're not like people these days,

491
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,880
-I knew from the moment with the talisman.<br>-Take this.

492
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,580
Now, eat up!

493
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,410
Thank you for the food!

494
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,280
It's a relief that you're safe.

495
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,440
It's a relief that the CEO won't have to worry either.

496
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,790
Oh my...even loyalty!

497
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,360
Since you came all the way here, tell us. How is our Soo Ho at the company?

498
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,730
-Stop that.<br>-I'm just curious!

499
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,690
He's always like...ill-tempered and stuff, right?

500
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,090
He's cool.

501
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,500
And because he's a genius, he's very very good with his work.

502
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,830
And even though it doesn't seem like it, he takes good care of every single employee.

503
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:13,630
And when there's something wrong or an aspect we're lacking in, he tries to help fix it.

504
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:23,900
I'll be leaving the company soon, that's what I wanted to tell you when I picked up.

505
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:30,830
Why!? A competent person like you has to be right next to Soo Ho!

506
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,040
Ah!

507
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:44,140
<i>Unni, I'm hungry. Shall we have some ramyon, or if not, ddokbeokki (spicy rice cakes)?</i>

508
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:55,200
<i>Unni, why are you so tired?</i>

509
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,710
<i> Smile. Do it like this!</i>

510
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,900
I have to take care of my little sister to the end.

511
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,690
Oh, you're coming in late.

512
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,890
Ah, you've arrived.

513
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,650
What are you doing here?

514
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,540
- Yes? <br> - What's going on in this place?

515
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,830
Oh, she came with us at dawn and clean up everything!

516
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,730
-And she apologized for everything.<br>-She told us to stay healthy.

517
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,430
Where did Dal Nim go?

518
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:58,350
Oh! She went outside with her to help carry stuff.

519
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,420
What is it? From a girl who wouldn't even let me step into her house!

520
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,770
Just because, I wanted to eat a meal with you.

521
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,730
Eat some of this.

522
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,910
I'll enjoy the meal.

523
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:14,230
But are you really quitting?

524
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,040
All that's left is development, you'll all be fine without me.

525
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,870
And Bo Ra's hospital bills?

526
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,060
Those are okay too.

527
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,760
What do you mean okay?

528
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:29,730
There's always money going out every month, you should just stay.

529
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,910
Did the CEO hint at you?

530
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,150
No, nothing like that.

531
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,390
Please give this to the CEO.

532
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:47,470
Do me this favor. It's because I feel so sorry.

533
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,290
Bo Nui said to give this to you.

534
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,530
Did she say anything else? Like, she was different from always?

535
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,600
No. We just ate together,

536
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,050
and she told me to do well with the diet I'm on.

537
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:14,160
Did she...tell you to stay healthy?

538
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,970
Yes. How did you know?

539
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,630
You really aren't going in?

540
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,600
I'm grateful to be even be here.

541
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,560
It's all done now. Bo Ra will wake up soon, do you have to take it this far?

542
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:33,160
You never know, you have to avoid and be careful about things that they say aren't good.

543
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,920
Then...you haven't seen Bo Ra's face once since the accident?

544
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,410
Go see her! I'll be with the doctor!

545
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,860
Bo Ra, your oppa came. Remember? Oppa Puccu.

546
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:05,720
This is harder than I thought.

547
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:13,030
Open your eyes. I've become really handsome.

548
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,950
You'll have to wake up

549
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:21,520
for thick-headed Sim Bo Nui to finally live like a human being.

550
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,490
-Have you really decided?<br>-Yes.

551
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,900
I don't know when it will be,

552
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,470
but I want to be with her at the very end.

553
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:37,200
Thank you for everything.

554
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,220
It's unexpected, I didn't think you would ever discharge her.

555
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,880
I must have been too selfish all this time.

556
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,470
I understand. Then.

557
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:02,270
What did the doctor say? She'll be okay, right? She'll wake up soon, right?

558
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,560
A little kid that would cling to the edge of your dress grew up to be a lady.

559
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,020
-She was pretty, she looks exactly like you.<br>-Really?

560
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,530
Her skin is clear and her complexion's nice,

561
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,570
she looks like she'll be up soon.

562
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,870
Of course. She will.

563
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,470
In the end, it's you that saves Bo Ra.

564
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:29,720
That would be nice.

565
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,160
When Bo Ra wakes up, I'll tell her to treat you well for as long as she lives!

566
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:39,810
Thanks. Let me hug you once!

567
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:46,640
It was really nice meeting you again.

568
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,780
It was really nice for me too.

569
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:59,230
Work hard until the end and you have to be nice with cooperating on IF.

570
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,370
As long as you're there, I'll give an OK to everything.

571
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,680
Even if there <i>is</i> someone I don't really like, I'll have to be patient.

572
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,280
Despite the way I look, I've been a professional for 6 years,

573
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,690
-I'm a far superior sunbae to you when it comes to society.<br>-You're messing with me again!

574
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,160
Let's go.

575
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,470
<i>CEO, I'm giving you a proper message.</i>

576
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:26,770
<i>Through all these times, I've been both grateful and apologetic.</i>

577
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,680
<i>You've been patient with so much.</i>

578
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,290
<i>All of it is my fault.</i>

579
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,620
<i>I'm the source of all the evil spirits.</i>

580
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,400
<i>And I was like that with you too.</i>

581
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,940
<i>Even so,</i>

582
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,530
<i>you're the first person to have ever put an umbrella over me.</i>

583
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,530
<i>That day, it was because of you I didn't feel as cold.</i>

584
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,990
<i>That memory, I'll keep it safe as it is precious.</i>

585
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:02,690
<i>I just ask, that you stay healthy.</i>

586
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:15,920
CEO Je! CEO Je! Wait! It's been a while!

587
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,020
-Oh! Daebak Software.<br>-Sim Bo Nui is upstairs, right?<br>-No, she isn't.

588
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:23,720
-Wait wait! She can't not be here! She hasn't picked up the phone for days, she's not at the office-who am I supposed to get the money from?<br>-What money?

589
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:27,970
Oh! The employee's not here so I can just get it from the employer. The water, 5 bottles.

590
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,340
-$550.<br>-I don't know what you're talking about.<br>-What's wrong with you, you're the employer-<br>-Talk to Ms. Sim Bo Nui personally.

591
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,750
No! I have to know where she is to talk to her-I don't know where she is that's why I'm talking to you!

592
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,970
Sim Bo Nui! Sim Bo Nui!

593
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,340
- What are you doing?<br>- Sim Bo Nui!

594
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,620
Noona's not here. She left.

595
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:24,040
-When? <br>-We went outside together and went separate ways, as if she has anywhere to go.

596
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,430
Are you saying you just let her go?

597
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,290
-Where did she say she would go? Did she say she would be anywhere?<br>-What's wrong with you?

598
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,220
I don't think Noona and you have a relationship for you to overreact like this.

599
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,100
What does it matter what kind of relationship I have with her!?

600
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:37,080
Haven't you seen her face?! She's completely pale,

601
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,110
and completely lifeless, you just let her go like that?!

602
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:41,570
She was laughing when we were talking,

603
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,450
we went together to see Bo Ra too!

604
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:48,360
Would a person going to die, tell the world they're going to die!?

605
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,340
Why would Noona die?

606
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,480
We just have to wait for Bo Ra to wake up now!

607
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,450
-When she did <i>that</i> with you!<br>-Nothing happened.

608
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:00,130
That day, nothing happened! So that woman,

609
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,050
she's completely sure her little sister is going to die.

610

613
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,760
Where did she go? Why won't you tell me!?

614
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,680
Patient information can't be shared with anyone except the guardian.

615
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,560
Ms. Bo Nui also told me to make sure.

616
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,660
I'm no different from family with Bo Ra, you saw me earlier too!

617
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,640
Where is Sim Bo Nui?

618
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:08,790
She said it had a very nice view,

619
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:11,500
that she would spend the last days there, together.
