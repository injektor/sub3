18
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,850
<font color="yellow">Is…this a dream?</font>

19
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,460
<font color="yellow">I’ve imagined Bo Ra waking up, hundreds of thousands of times.</font>

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,560
<font color="yellow">But I was never selfish about wanting to see her, not even in my dreams.</font>

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,430
<font color="yellow">From now on, let’s come to see her. Hundreds of thousands of times.</font>

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,040
<font color="yellow">I must’ve done great things for you in the past life!</font>

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,400
<font color="yellow">But I won’t wish for more.</font>

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,360
<font color="yellow">I thought I’d never see her for the rest of my life. But I saw her once.</font>

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,540
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for today. Please get back safely!</font>

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,330
<font color="yellow">Wait! You're just going to leave?</font>

27
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,850
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,640
<font color="yellow">Let’s go in the car.</font>

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,200
<font color="yellow">It’s close, I’ll walk! I have a conscience too, I won’t bother you any more!</font>

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,930
<font color="yellow">Fine then…</font>

31
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,600
<font color="yellow">Let’s eat! Let's eat...</font>

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,720
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

33
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,910
<font color="yellow">I mean, from morning until now, I drove you, I was your talisman. Are you running now that you’ve used me all up?</font>

34
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,440
<font color="yellow">You said you were thankful.<br>I don’t believe in the past life so pay me back in this life.</font>

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,370
<font color="yellow">No, I said I was going to go see my parents and you forced me…</font>

36
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,160
<font color="yellow">I don’t know-I don’t know what you’re talking about!<br>There’s a restaurant right here!<br>Let’s go here to eat!</font>

37
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,400
<font color="yellow">Let’s leave, please?</font>

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,390
<font color="yellow">We can go after we eat.</font>

39
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,180
<font color="yellow">Eel, flatfish, salmon, nigiri, fish-covered rice-there’s nothing for you to eat!<br>I’ll buy next time, okay?</font>

40
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,980
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,740
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

42
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,790
<font color="yellow">Oh-sorry, we’ll come next time!</font>

43
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,670
<font color="yellow">We’ll be ordering now.</font>

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,830
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, there are things I can eat.</font>

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,660
<font color="yellow">You’re right…</font>

46
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,780
<font color="yellow">You were happy there was nothing for me, right!?</font>

47
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,860
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that!</font>

48
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I’ll eat well.</font>

49
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,930
<font color="yellow">Did you have stomach problems after eating seafood once?</font>

50
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,760
<font color="yellow">I heard from your mother that you were a fish maniac when you were young.</font>

51
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,540
<font color="yellow">Nevermind…</font>

52
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,720
<font color="yellow">I almost died. Because I fell into the sea.</font>

53
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,930
<font color="yellow">I told you before, I have a great sense of imagination. My memory is even better.</font>

54
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,570
<font color="yellow">The saltiness that passed my throat. The smell of the sea in my nose.</font>

55
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,100
<font color="yellow">It's all vivid.</font>

56
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,890
<font color="yellow">After that, I stopped eating fishy food. It’s a trauma with a clear cause that reaped results.</font>

57
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,150
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and eat! So that we can have coffee too.</font>

58
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,750
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

59
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,440
<font color="yellow">You're good.</font>

60
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,880
<font color="yellow">Boo!</font>

61
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,530
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

62
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,490
<font color="yellow">It’s just, I remembered when we first met.</font>

63
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,080
<font color="yellow">You were really flustered that day because of me, right?</font>

64
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,690
<font color="yellow">Constantly, always, you fluster me, every single time.</font>

65
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:15,460
<font color="yellow">I’m sorry…for constantly, always, giving you trouble, every single time.</font>

66
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,330
<font color="yellow">I guess that’s why they say you can’t fix the life you’re given. I'll be careful.</font>

67
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,590
<font color="yellow">You said…your parents passed away when you were 16, right?</font>

68
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,600
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,160
<font color="yellow">Do you think that…that’s your fault too?</font>

70
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,330
<font color="yellow">With the blade, destiny, that sort of thing?</font>

71
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,850
<font color="yellow">I didn’t know it then.</font>

72
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:47,160
<font color="yellow">Only my baby chick died, only my seat partner got hurt, and my mom and dad…</font>

73
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,840
<font color="yellow">Even when they died getting tickets their daughter wanted, I thought it was all a coincidence.</font>

74
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,680
<font color="yellow">If I knew earlier, it would’ve been better. If I knew, I’d have sent Bo Ra away to be adopted…</font>

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,210
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such things? Says the person who gave up her life for her little sister.</font>

76
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,510
<font color="yellow">Money is something I could make and food was something I didn’t need, but that was the scariest thing.</font>

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,650
<font color="yellow">The thought that they could take my Bo Ra away from me.</font>

78
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,790
<font color="yellow">I’d wake up multiple times, to touch her face again and again…</font>

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,930
<font color="yellow">Should I try guessing what you’re thinking?</font>

80
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:42,550
<font color="yellow">Let’s see…“Oh, how pathetic, how naive-this woman really…never changes”</font>

81
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,370
<font color="yellow">Am I right?</font>

82
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,570
<font color="yellow">You must have had such a hard time.</font>

83
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:08,560
<font color="yellow">A little kid feeding, dressing, raising a little-er kid…</font>

84
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,230
<font color="yellow">It must have been hard for you.</font>

85
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,260
<font color="yellow">Let’s go now, I’ve taken too much of your time.</font>

86
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,570
<font color="yellow">You’re being disrespectful in the middle of a devotion, thinking of such things!</font>

87
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,680
<font color="yellow">I only think of Bo Ra, no matter what!</font>

88
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,270
<font color="yellow">Please watch over her, from her fingers to her toes, and wake her up.</font>

89
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,640
<font color="yellow">I don’t want anything else.</font>

90
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,010
<font color="yellow"><i>Boo!</i></font>

91
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:29,180
<font color="yellow">♬ <i>That day when we first met</i> ♬</font>

92
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,490
<font color="yellow"><i>Whenever you miss her, tell me.</i></font>

93
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,380
<font color="yellow">♬ <i>You must have thought it was a joke</i> ♬</font>

94
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:55,230
<font color="yellow">♬ <i>I’ll show you the truth</i> ♬</font>

95
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,360
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

96
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,770
<font color="yellow">Is that too greasy?</font>

97
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,910
<font color="yellow">Are you up? What are you doing?</font>

98
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,800
<font color="yellow">How do you use pretty words-did you eat? I don't know anymore...</font>

99
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,890
<font color="yellow">Hello! Please have some of this!</font>

100
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,860
<font color="yellow">Oh my!</font>

101
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,280
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring so much!?</font>

102
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,590
<font color="yellow">How is my Bo Ra today? From now on, I want to journal every single day!</font>

103
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,760
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra? She’s busy right now! <i>Very</i> busy!</font>

104
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,690
<font color="yellow">She’s meeting with a handsome man. The man you came with last time!</font>

105
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,650
<font color="yellow">It was you?</font>

106
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,220
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there anyone else that would be here besides me?</font>

107
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,120
<font color="yellow">No!<br>Nurse Lee told me that a handsome man came.</font>

108
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,680
<font color="yellow">That’s me!</font>

109
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,630
<font color="yellow">How is Bo Ra? She looks a lot more lively, right?!</font>

110
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,500
<font color="yellow">She must be sleeping. I just quietly said hi and came out.</font>

111
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,150
<font color="yellow">Noona, you want to see Bo Ra too, right?</font>

112
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:29,150
<font color="yellow">Geon Wook, I saw Bo Ra’s face! With my own two eyes!</font>

113
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,610
<font color="yellow">When? How?!</font>

114
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,880
<font color="yellow">Yesterday. It’s all thanks to the CEO!</font>

115
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,170
<font color="yellow">CEO Je…?</font>

116
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,670
<font color="yellow">He told me to think of him as my talisman! He said he’d come with me whenever I wanted to see her.</font>

117
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
<font color="yellow"><i>My CEO hates superstitions and any signs!</i></font>

118
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,770
<font color="yellow">I thought he’d be really feisty, but the more I get to know him, I think he’s a really good person.</font>

119
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,700
<font color="yellow">That’s good.</font>

120
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,250
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

121
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,930
<font color="yellow">Why did he come again? Without even contacting me?</font>

122
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,950
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

123
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,200
<font color="yellow">It’s the CEO. Has he been waiting long? He should've called!</font>

124
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,720
<font color="yellow">Does he still burst into your room?</font>

125
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,340
<font color="yellow">Sometimes he stops by when he’s in the neighborhood…</font>

126
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,700
<font color="yellow"><i>That person has a really messed-up personality.</i></font>

127
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,380
<font color="yellow">Last time he came by without notice, he kept droning on about ominous things like you would die and stuff.</font>

128
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,070
<font color="yellow">And then he just wandered around the house all night.</font>

129
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,150
<font color="yellow">The CEO did? When?</font>

130
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,990
<font color="yellow">The day Bo Ra woke up!</font>

131
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,540
<font color="yellow">Noona…you didn’t come home that day…</font>

132
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,620
<font color="yellow">This has to end. I'm going to tell him to remember boundaries.</font>

133
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,070
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey, Geon Wook! It's not that!</font>

134
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,090
<font color="yellow">Geon Wook! Hey!</font>

135
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,690
<font color="yellow">Look here, CEO Je...!</font>

136
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,920
<font color="yellow">Oh! It really is you! Player Gary Choi!</font>

137
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,900
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm Reporter Choi from Women's Sense. I heard that you were looking for your father. Is this true?</font>

138
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,380
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

139
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,380
<font color="yellow">Excuse me! What do you think you're doing all of a sudden?</font>

140
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,570
<font color="yellow">What are you doing!? You can't take pictures! Don't take pictures!</font>

141
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,780
<font color="yellow"><i>It's okay, you just need to say a few words!</i></font>

142
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,710
<font color="yellow">Wait! Wait, please! Wait!</font>

143
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,840
<font color="yellow">That inquiry office, detective-whatever it is, that's the only place the information could've leaked from.</font>

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,860
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and give me the number!</font>

145
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,640
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. We have all the original files and we signed a penalty agreement should any of the copies surface.</font>

146
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,910
<font color="yellow">Should we just sue all of them?!</font>

147
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,130
<font color="yellow">There's no need to fight the medium itself. You'll only increase the gossip.</font>

148
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,860
<font color="yellow">Amy, let's do a broadcast.</font>

149
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,300
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

150
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,320
<font color="yellow">We blocked it by force this time, but once word gets out, it'll be in the blink of an eye.</font>

151
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,650
<font color="yellow">After the broadcast, there won't be a problem with the game either.</font>

152
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:50,010
<font color="yellow">You don't have to push yourself. If Gary doesn't want it, we won't impose it on you.</font>

153
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,070
<font color="yellow">Gary. People are cruel.</font>

154
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,840
<font color="yellow">They might be at your feet in praise but just wait until they find a trace.</font>

155
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,220
<font color="yellow">"He's the worst bastard", "What a pitiful child",</font>

156
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,740
<font color="yellow">all sorts of things will run from their mouths.</font>

157
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,310
<font color="yellow">I'll brace myself. As long as I can find my dad, everything's fine.</font>

158
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,670
<font color="yellow">Broadcasts are good for impact.</font>

159
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,110
<font color="yellow">On top of that, because it's Gary, it'll get around faster, further.</font>

160
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,680
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's try this.</font>

161
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,590
<font color="yellow">I'll make it according to the concept we want.</font>

162
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,880
<font color="yellow">I won't let our Gary be cursed and shredded by anyone.</font>

163
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,410
<font color="yellow">Zeze will also support you as much as we can. Tell me if you need anything.</font>

164
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,830
<font color="yellow">How'd it go?</font>

165
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,560
<font color="yellow">The best defense is going on the offense. We decided to go with what I wanted.</font>

166
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,380
<font color="yellow">Let's make a beta version before the day the athlete leaves.</font>

167
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,490
<font color="yellow">We're cutting it too close!</font>

168
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,490
<font color="yellow">Gary is the main character, we'll need his confirmation. The person-in-charge of the scenario will be Ms. Sim Bo Nui.</font>

169
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,220
<font color="yellow">After the broadcast on Saturday, please come up with the story for his parents.</font>

170
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,970
<font color="yellow">Yes! I understand!</font>

171
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,490
<font color="yellow">In a month, we'll have the open beta. In three months, we'll have the official release.</font>

172
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,750
<font color="yellow">What!?</font>

173
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,910
<font color="yellow">What about our workshop!? It's this Friday! It can't be cancelled!</font>

174
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,830
<font color="yellow">I wanted to eat meat! Meat!</font>

175
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,480
<font color="yellow">No matter how I look at it, the workshop this time around...</font>

176
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,180
<font color="yellow">It'd be best to go, right?</font>

177
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,380
<font color="yellow">What?!</font>

178
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,450
<font color="yellow">Go and play no matter what. You'll have to clear your minds to give it your all.</font>

179
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,270
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

180
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,790
<font color="yellow">Yes. We understand!</font>

181
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,660
<font color="yellow">Go have fun. And eat meat.</font>

182
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes.</font>

183
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,150
<font color="yellow">I understand!</font>

184
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,860
<font color="yellow">I was going in.</font>

185
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,530
<font color="yellow">Yes...Excuse me, CEO! Thank you.</font>

186
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,940
<font color="yellow">W-What for?</font>

187
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,300
<font color="yellow">For being considerate towards Geon Wook. Now just accept that you're a good tiger.</font>

188
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,240
<font color="yellow">I mean, what's there about me being a good tiger to Gary, not even you.</font>

189
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,130
<font color="yellow">And why would you be thanking me for that?</font>

190
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,850
<font color="yellow">Because he's like a little brother I like and cherish.</font>

191
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,670
<font color="yellow">Wow, you must like him and cherish him a lot.</font>

192
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,440
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

193
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,240
<font color="yellow">Food!</font>

194
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,790
<font color="yellow">Let's eat. You said you were thankful.</font>

195
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,740
<font color="yellow">If you're thankful, you have to buy food.</font>

196
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,180
<font color="yellow">Oh, sorry, I have an appointment today.</font>

197
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,100
<font color="yellow">With who...</font>

198
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,300
<font color="yellow">Fine, go ahead.</font>

199
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,960
<font color="yellow">Why does he keep asking to eat food?</font>

200
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,050
<font color="yellow">That's amazing.</font>

201
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,410
<font color="yellow">How...is he beautiful down to the bone?</font>

202
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,300
<font color="yellow">I don't even need chocolate for my blood sugar, you know what I mean?</font>

203
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,160
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah, he's definitely top-class among human beings.</i></font>

204
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,960
<font color="yellow">In other words, women lose their minds when they see a good looking guy...</font>

205
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,250
<font color="yellow">Can you be quiet?!</font>

206
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,230
<font color="yellow">I need to appreciate a handsome man.</font>

207
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,660
<font color="yellow">Though he's incomparable to the heavenly-class.</font>

208
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,120
<font color="yellow">Shaman Sir! I'm here!</font>

209
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,990
<font color="yellow">Hello mother...</font>

210
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,430
<font color="yellow">They say maybe not for enemies but grace should always be repaid.</font>

211
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,870
<font color="yellow">No! I'm okay...</font>

212
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,730
<font color="yellow">Come in!</font>

213
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,890
<font color="yellow">We came for another talisman!</font>

214
00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:00,400
<font color="yellow">This is a miss who knows a few things. She's an employee at my son's company. Isn't she pretty?</font>

215
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,680
<font color="yellow">Have you been well, Shaman Sir?</font>

216
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,050
<font color="yellow">The talisman for joy, I use that one often too.</font>

217
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,650
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.</font>

218
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,280
<font color="yellow">What if we were married couples in the past life!?</font>

219
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,710
<font color="yellow">How could this be! Shaman Sir! Please look at our matrimonial harmony! I think it'll be killer!</font>

220
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:27,950
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and please see your fortune. I'm here solely as a delivery girl!</font>

221
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,070
<font color="yellow">First, please do my son's first!</font>

222
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,320
<font color="yellow">What happened to that raccoon? Is it still on him!?</font>

223
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,000
<font color="yellow"><i>No! No! Please don't!</i></font>

224
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,090
<font color="yellow"><i>No! No!</i></font>

225
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,590
<font color="yellow">I told you, right? The frivolous raccoon!</font>

226
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,810
<font color="yellow">Yes! That damned raccoon!</font>

227
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,680
<font color="yellow">How is it?</font>

228
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,410
<font color="yellow">It's hanging!</font>

229
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,850
<font color="yellow"><i>The waves are coming in.</i></font>

230
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,930
<font color="yellow"><i>If he keeps dipping his ankles,</i></font>

231
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,290
<font color="yellow"><i>the moment he realizes it,</i></font>

232
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,000
<font color="yellow"><i>he'll be under!</i></font>

233
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

234
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,340
<font color="yellow">Nothing's been going on at the office? Like the roof is leaking?</font>

235
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,980
<font color="yellow">Or the bathroom floods? Or the water fountain in CEO Je's room is broken?</font>

236
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
<font color="yellow">Our son can't ever be near water.</font>

237
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,120
<font color="yellow">He fell in and almost died when he was a kid!</font>

238
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,700
<font color="yellow">Oh! I see...</font>

239
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,020
<font color="yellow">I'll watch over him well!</font>

240
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,810
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it. Of course the ignorant being would drop the kid in the sea, as if that would teach him how to swim!</font>

241
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,470
<font color="yellow">Someone...purposely dropped him in there?</font>

242
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,830
<font color="yellow">The man who knocked his head falling backwards!</font>

243
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,560
<font color="yellow">Is <i>he</i> the raccoon on Soo Ho?</font>

244
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,670
<font color="yellow">I'll put this talisman in your care too.</font>

245
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,590
<font color="yellow">Give it to him personally this time! And while you're at it, you can see his face too.</font>

246
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,800
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see him throw it away in front of me. It feels like he's crumpling my heart.</font>

247
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,230
<font color="yellow"><i>Ms. Bo Nui!</i></font>

248
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,480
<font color="yellow">Oh! Hold on!</font>

249
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,860
<font color="yellow">Hi Boss!</font>

250
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,050
<font color="yellow">Are you on your way in after lunch?</font>

251
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,740
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes! Have you eaten?</i></font>

252
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,330
<font color="yellow">I'll have to eat when I head in. I've got a lot of side dishes!</font>

253
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,300
<font color="yellow">She's our CEO's mother! I had an errand to run for her!</font>

254
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

255
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,760
<font color="yellow"><i>He's the boss of the chicken place our office goes to often! He's very kind!</i></font>

256
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,460
<font color="yellow">I see...Ms. Bo Nui, I'll be going.</font>

257
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,340
<font color="yellow">Please go safely!</font>

258
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,200
<font color="yellow">I'll be going! Please work hard!</font>

259
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,490
<font color="yellow">What is this!? This! What happened to this?! Can we fix it!?</font>

260
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,870
<font color="yellow">What's with this, seriously?!</font>

261
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,220
<font color="yellow">Who was it! Who did this?!</font>

262
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,270
<font color="yellow">Oh! It looks like you pressed the wrong button!</font>

263
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,830
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ji Hoon?!</font>

264
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,600
<font color="yellow">No, no! It's not me!</font>

265
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,030
<font color="yellow">We were all just on our way in from lunch. Why take it out on us?</font>

266
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,370
<font color="yellow">Then who was it?! Being so childish?!</font>

267
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,790
<font color="yellow">How should we know!?</font>

268
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,670
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

269
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,920
<font color="yellow">Bones...a person's nose bone, chin bone, forehead bone-they're all the same...</font>

270
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,870
<font color="yellow">Beautiful...tsh...right...</font>

271
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,890
<font color="yellow">Sim Bo Nui, look at you. In every single corner-you scaredy cat!</font>

272
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Dal Nim!</i></font>

273
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,250
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you going, why!?</font>

274
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,480
<font color="yellow">I have to check on Bo Ra every day. What if I go with you and we get into an accident along the way?</font>

275
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,770
<font color="yellow">Even in college, you couldn't go to MT's because you had to work. The only countryside you've ever been in is to work until your bones ache!</font>

276
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,900
<font color="yellow">Now Bo Ra's awake, you can whistle some tunes and have fun!</font>

277
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,130
<font color="yellow">I want to too. Go to a nice place and see pretty things, eat yummy food.</font>

278
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:19,040
<font color="yellow">Then you can! Let's go...Bo Nui, let's go!</font>

279
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:26,180
<font color="yellow">That day, the day Bo Ra got into an accident. I thought that if I gave it one more minute, I could find the bug.</font>

280
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,850
<font color="yellow">And like that, I kept getting greedy for one minute, two minutes...and my Bo Ra's surgery got delayed.</font>

281
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:39,240
<font color="yellow">Like you said, after Bo Ra woke up, a breeze keeps tickling my heart.</font>

282
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,440
<font color="yellow">But...that's being selfish.</font>

283
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,200
<font color="yellow"><i>You know well that I can't do that.</i></font>

284
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,120
<font color="yellow">It's not selfishness...</font>

285
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,360
<font color="yellow">Are you ready?</font>

286
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,430
<font color="yellow">Ms. Bo Nui! Here!</font>

287
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,700

571
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:54,110
<font color="yellow">Then what about you? Are you so good that you slam your bike into that ditch?!</font>

572
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:57,280
<font color="yellow">The machine didn't listen to me! I told you the wheel didn't move!</font>

573
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,060
<font color="yellow">Machines have souls too.</font>

574
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,420
<font color="yellow">How cheeky must you have been for it to break like that!</font>

575
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,920
<font color="yellow">Y-You...You're saying that <i>I'm</i> cheeky, right?!</font>

576
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,390
<font color="yellow">As expected! Your memory, imagination and sense of understanding is perfect!</font>

577
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,480
<font color="yellow">Is that a compliment...?</font>

578
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,580
<font color="yellow">Why are you last?!</font>

579
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,520
<font color="yellow">What about Noona? I was looking for Bo Nui Noona. Is she here?</font>

580
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,250
<font color="yellow">Let's ride again!</font>

581
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,980
<font color="yellow">- I want to ride again! It's so fun!<br>-<i> Then we can ride again!</i></font>

582
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,800
<font color="yellow">That damn...</font>

583
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,020
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah! Let's ride again!</i></font>

584
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,720
<font color="yellow">I'm crazy. I'm delusional, as if there's anything to do.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Don't touch me.<br>- Let me grill!</font>

588
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,570
<font color="yellow">To be honest, it's time!</font>

589
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,390
<font color="yellow">I'm just thinking about the possibility of him getting hurt!</font>

590
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,520
<font color="yellow"><i>- He won't get hurt!<br>- We could seriously die.</i></font>

591
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,150
<font color="yellow"><i>Then we can die!</i></font>

592
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,130
<font color="yellow"><i>We have to dunk him when he's here, when else would we get the chance!?</i></font>

593
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,720
<font color="yellow">Ahem-! CEO! You're here!</font>

594
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,740
<font color="yellow">Pour him a drink.</font>

595
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,520
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho!</font>

596
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,120
<font color="yellow">I don't drink alcohol but you poured alcohol.</font>

597
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:19,790
<font color="yellow"><i>- Give him some coke!<br></i>- Now since our CEO is here, it's time for the long-awaited Game of Truth!</font>

598
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,290
<font color="yellow">Yeah!</font>

599
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,290
<font color="yellow"><i>- Spin the bottle!</i><br>- Okay!</font>

00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:33,160
<font color="yellow"><i>Sim Bo Nui!</i></font>

601

00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,450
<font color="yellow">CEO Je's got a dirty attitude!</font>

606
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,120
<font color="yellow">- Yes...<br>- <i>Right!?</i></font>

607
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,280
<font color="yellow">- You're happy these days!<br> -Mhm.</font>

608
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,000

609
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,530
<font color="yellow">You're dating someone?</font>

610
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,620

612
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,010
<font color="yellow">Oh! It looks like she does@</font>

613
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,390
<font color="yellow">- What?<br>- We got her!</font>

614
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:18,170
<font color="yellow">I don't! I don't have anyone I like, I don't have that luxury either.</font>

615
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,850
<font color="yellow">Hey, Je Soo Ho. Let's talk. Did I come here to grill meat?</font>

616
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,330
<font color="yellow">How can no one ask me to play with them.</font>

617
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,560
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to grill meat for hundreds of thousands of days?</font>

618
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:32,890
<font color="yellow">Wait! Ms. Bo Nui! Be honest! You're secretly dating the CEO, right?!</font>

619
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,170
<font color="yellow">No! That's just trouble!</font>

620
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,970
<font color="yellow">Hand it over, come on! Hand it over!</font>

621
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,630
<font color="yellow">These people-did you bet again!</font>

622
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,860
<font color="yellow">Give me mine first.</font>

623
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,900
<font color="yellow"><i>Ms. Seung Hyeon always wins!</i></font>

624
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,230
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

625
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,970
<font color="yellow">Just...walking...</font>

626
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:03,510
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? In America, just being at the riverside was hard for you.</font>

627
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,560
<font color="yellow">How many years ago was that.</font>

628
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,420
<font color="yellow">Wow, my Soo Ho is all grown up. He's an adult!</font>

629
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,740
<font color="yellow">I'm not the puny kid from your memories.</font>

630
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,350
<font color="yellow">Then why don't you date anyone? Yang Ha said so.</font>

631
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:28,370
<font color="yellow">That he taught you about everything but women.</font>

632
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,790
<font color="yellow">How about me? It was only me back then.</font>

633
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,800
<font color="yellow">No?</font>

634
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:47,550
<font color="yellow">It's not that big of a deal. I already confirmed the questions and format too.</font>

635
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,120
<font color="yellow"><i>You're trying to find your father!</i></font>

636
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,890
<font color="yellow">Am I not allowed to?</font>

637
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:56,980
<font color="yellow"><i>Of course you can't! Just to find that person, you want to destroy your reputation, all you've done!</i></font>

638
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,920
<font color="yellow"><i>All in one blow!? No! Never!</i></font>

639
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,210
<font color="yellow">Nothing will be destroyed. Mom, please.</font>

640
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,760
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll start with Amy. And cancel the contract with IM.</i></font>

641
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,090
<font color="yellow"><i>Geon Wook!</i></font>

642
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,230
<font color="yellow">Noona...</font>

643
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:26,890
<font color="yellow">Your mother, is she really angry?</font>

644
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,670
<font color="yellow">It's my first broadcast.</font>

645
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:33,220
<font color="yellow">So she's probably worried about this and that.</font>

646
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,740
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow...</font>

647
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,070
<font color="yellow">What time do I have to be there by?</font>

648
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:42,690
<font color="yellow">Noona.</font>

649
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:46,720
<font color="yellow">You're going up tonight, right? I'll leave early tomorrow morning.</font>

650
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,030
<font color="yellow">Then let's just go together!</font>

651
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,830
<font color="yellow">I have to at least get to the end of today.</font>

652
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:54,090
<font color="yellow">And if we go up together...you never know...</font>

653
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:57,100
<font color="yellow">I'd feel better going separately.</font>

654
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,870
<font color="yellow">Thanks Noona.</font>

655
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,650
<font color="yellow">I feel like I can finally breathe.</font>

656
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,770
<font color="yellow">Mommy! Momma!</font>

657
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,170
<font color="yellow">- Why? Why?!<br>- It keeps following me!</font>

658
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,230
<font color="yellow">Ow.</font>

659
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,280
<font color="yellow">It left. It's gone.</font>

660
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,490
<font color="yellow">- It's gone?<br>- Yeah, it's gone.</font>

661
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,120
<font color="yellow">- Really?<br>- Yeah.</font>

662
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,090
<font color="yellow">I really hate moths the most in the world.</font>

663
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,980
<font color="yellow">I really hate the countryside!</font>

664
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,420
<font color="yellow">So why'd you come...</font>

665
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,900
<font color="yellow">- Why?!<br>- Stay still.</font>

666
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,420
<font color="yellow">Why?! Why! Why?!</font>

667
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,450
<font color="yellow">Why?! Ah!?</font>

668
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,030

670
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,820
<font color="yellow">Hey! It's gone. It's gone!</font>

671
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,170
<font color="yellow">It looks like I should head in now.</font>

672
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:59,300
<font color="yellow">Be careful on your way up. I'll call you.</font>

673
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,350
<font color="yellow">What'd they say? The company is out of control, right?</font>

674
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:12,230
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it. I'll get you on-air no matter what and take all the responsibility.</font>

675
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,050
<font color="yellow">Just now...with CEO Je...</font>

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,370
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

694
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,430
<font color="yellow">Have you had a lot?</font>

695
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,830

<font color="yellow">I said I don't drink!</font>

698
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,730
<font color="yellow"><i>I guess those people intend to live only to today.</i></font>

699
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,800
<font color="yellow">They said they're going to dunk the CEO in water.</font>

700
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,480
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

701
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,880
<font color="yellow">We've been through more than enough. Times like these, you go crazy just once.</font>

702
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,510
<font color="yellow">Ms. Bo Nui! You want to help them?!</font>

703

<font color="yellow"><i>You look great!</i></font>

709
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,710
<font color="yellow">What are you doing! This is dangerous!</font>

710
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,830
<font color="yellow">The CEO...we just wanted to pull a prank on the CEO...</font>

711
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,050
<font color="yellow">Is there a reason to kill someone by playing in the water tonight?!</font>

712
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,300
<font color="yellow">No, it's shallow here so it's fine. It only comes up to the waist!</font>

713
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,170
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

714
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,920
<font color="yellow">Don't overreact.</font>

715
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,030
<font color="yellow">No, is this really something to get that mad about?</font>

716
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,600

717
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,730
<font color="yellow">Exactly! If he came to the workshop, he should be dunked at least once!</font>

718
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,760
<font color="yellow">It should feel cool.</font>

719
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,110
<font color="yellow">I told you we shouldn't do it.</font>

720
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,780
<font color="yellow">- What's the point in saying it now.<br>- You should've said something!<br>- We're all in the same boat now.</font>

721
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:08,540
<font color="yellow">Leave. I just need some sleep.</font>

722
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,770
<font color="yellow">Don't go back there. I don't want my employees knowing.</font>

723
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:14,640
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the hospital...</font>

724
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,850
<font color="yellow">I said I'm fine!</font>

725
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:21,530
<font color="yellow">Why are you like this, seriously!? If you're hurt then you can say you're hurt! Why do you hide it!? Why do you pretend it doesn't hurt!</font>

726
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,630
<font color="yellow">Why do you try to carry everything on your own?</font>

727
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:33,670
<font color="yellow">CEO, the way you held an umbrella over me, the way you became my talisman and held me...</font>

728
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,270
<font color="yellow">Let me do that for you.</font>

729
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,780
<font color="yellow">Which one would you like?</font>

730
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,250
<font color="yellow">I need to check your driver's license...</font>

731
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,400
<font color="yellow">How can you say something like that at a time like this?</font>

732
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,890
<font color="yellow">I'm making this clear. This is my <i>trauma</i>. Not something you caused.</font>

733
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:29,290
<font color="yellow">Do you...still hold a grudge against your father?</font>

734
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,500
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

735
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,750
<font color="yellow">I didn't know anything and I went on and on about being good your parents...</font>

736
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,880
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for sticking my nose in...</font>

737
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,500
<font color="yellow">10 years.</font>

738
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:51,160
<font color="yellow">Since I went to study overseas when I was 11 years old, I lived with him for 10 years.</font>

739
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,760
<font color="yellow">Well, even if it wasn't that, there wasn't much for me to look back on.</font>

740
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,700
<font color="yellow">You went to study abroad alone? An 11 year old? That's a baby!</font>

741
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,650
<font color="yellow">But here or there, it's all the same. In the end, all people who I can't communicate with.</font>

742
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:09,480
<font color="yellow">Wherever I was. I was always a monkey.</font>

743
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:15,840
<font color="yellow">Fascinating and strange, something fun to watch on the other the side of the fence.</font>

744
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,240
<font color="yellow">It wasn't bad. I hate dealing with people who smile at my face,</font>

745
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,500
<font color="yellow">then talk trash about me behind my back.</font>

746
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,480
<font color="yellow">You must have been lonely.</font>

747
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:38,180

748
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,280
<font color="yellow">Why do you put a person that says he's okay, in a cave?</font>

749
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,630
<font color="yellow">I thought that you were someone that was born with all the luck in the world.</font>

750
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:56,030

752
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,970

00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,280
<font color="yellow">You thought...?</font>

754
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:29,740
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

755
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,850
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Just go.</font>

756
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:38,310
<font color="yellow">I barfed <i>on</i> you. This much is nothing.</font>

757
