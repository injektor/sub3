1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,080
<i> Timing and subtitles brought to you by <br> The Lucky Team @ Viki </i>

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,100
CEO... you're a kinder person than I thought you would be.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,570
W-What kind of crap is that?

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,770
It's true!

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:20,120
You thought I was terminal, so you even decided to let me put a ridiculous clause in the contract.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,400
So you knew it was ridiculous?!

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,450
You were worried so you even bought me medicine.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,090
And in the off-chance that it might've been a pervert, you got involved even though you don't know how to fight.

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,930
Looking back on it, you're really cool.

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,520
If CEO said things a little nicer, I think you'd be a 100 points.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,000
Ah... we went over 1 hour and 20 minutes.

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,490
We'll cancel tomorrow and add an hour and a half to our meeting next week Saturday.

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,480
See you next week.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,250
About that.

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,030
Can't we spend it now?

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,100
- Pardon? <br> -The hour and thirty minutes.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,300
Let's spend it now.

18
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,030
Today...sleep with me, Mr. Je Soo Ho.

19
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,580
What did you say?

20
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,860
What did you...say just now?

21
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,370
You said... that you didn't have any time.

22
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,820
If you stay the night with me, let's have the contract dating called off.

23
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
There's no need to forcibly meet anymore. So-

24
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,130
Wait. Hold Up. One Moment.

25
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:28,000
So you're saying, not "sleeping" but as a man and woman...

26
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,530
Hotel accommodations cost, nightview, was it all excuses for this?

27
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,130
Was that your objective from the beginning?

28
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,040
That's right.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,500
From the beginning when I asked to date, I thought this... was included.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,990
Then making a fuss about going on dates or not, forcing yourself on me after drinking, was all because of this I see.

31
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,510
Are you crazy for men?

32
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,960
You said you didn't like me. That it was a fake relationship.

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,300
But you're saying you want to sleep with me? From the first day? Out of the blue?

34
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,840
Yes.

35
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,990
Then why didn't you say so from the start?

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,070
Then I wouldn't have engaged in a labor contract like this with you.

37
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,770
Can't you... think of me as someone you don't know?

38
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,520
Just...as someone you met at a bar or at a club.

39
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,410
Men think of that kind of stuff as a sporting event so...

40
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,560
Look here, Sim Bo Nui!

41
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,000
I am not joking nor playing around right now.

42
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,070
I'm being sincere.

43
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,730
It's possible whether you like someone or love them,

44
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,870
and to simply satisfy a carnal desire, without those feelings is not even the least bit shameful in today's society.

45
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:11,100
Whether you're crazy or addicted to men. I know full well I'm not in the position to criticize you.

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:20,060
But, leave me out; however you decide to live your life doesn't matter, but that's not who I am.

47
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,910
I'm begging you.

48
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,390
Is it still a no if I ask you like this?

49
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,220
I'll do anything, I'll do everything you tell me to do!

50
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,890
I mean...why are you being like this?

51
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,590
You're not terminal and you said it wasn't your dying wish either.

52
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,350
If it's really because of your sexual frustration, then look into someone else.

53
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,920
The world's filled with men willing to sleep with women they've met for the first time!

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,430
It has to be you.

55
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,730
It must. Be you.

56
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:16,490
♬<i> Tell me. Tell me with your lips clamped shut </i>♬

57
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:23,390

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,380
<i>however you decide to live your life doesn't matter but that's not me.</i>

74
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:08,460
I want to date normally with a person I like, and live like that too.

75
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,510
<i>It's true!</i>

76
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,080
I saw it! I really saw it!

77
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,340
Oh man! You really came!?

78
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,440
He's my friend. He's uglier than me, right?

79
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,420
Hey, it's loud and it stinks in here, isn't there some place quiet?

80
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,690
There isn't.

81
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,730
Later, we can go to a place and-

82
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,320
no, no wait, wait there!

83
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,460
I'll be right back!

84
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,340
-What is it?<br>-What, it's not like we only meet because something happens.

85
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,090
Hey, go fool God.

86
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,590
You suddenly call asking where I am, then come to a club, which you hate so much,

87
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:58,760
and a guy who only sips on soda is-look at you! You're drinking alcohol! This is a signal saying something happened!

88
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,220
What signal, what's a signal!

89
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,760
-Is it because of Seol Hee?<br>-No!

90
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,040
For a girl from your past to suddenly appear-of course it's nerve-wracking!

91
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,730
I said that's not it!

92
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,430
-Never mind.<br>-You're so damn hesitant-fine! I won't say anything either!

93
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,490
Why do you think a woman would ask to sleep with you?

94
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,410
How could she do that? I can't understand!

95
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,140
Y-You...

96
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,060
You slept with a woman?!

97
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,100
-You slept with a woman-!<br>-You're crazy!

98
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,930
-This Soo Ho-!<br>-I said you're crazy!

99
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,930
You had your first night-!

100
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,650
S-So, you're saying, a woman offered a hot night...

101
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,340
and you refused, you idiot, what do I <i>do</i> with you!

102
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,970
W-Why's that being an idiot! Doing something like that with someone you don't like is just being an animal...

103
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,610
Wow, coming onto the almighty Je Soo Ho,

104
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,070
this is fun!

105
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,170
-But was that girl really drunk?<br>-No.<br>-Then was she high?

106
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,580
-No.<br>-Or, is she pretty?

107
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,050
Yeah-ugh!

108
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,220
You've hurt a pretty lady.

109
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,480
-Me?<br>-Yeah.

110
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,980
Look,

111
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,120
look at all those beautiful women-no matter how drunk they are, no one will take the initiative.

112
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,280
It doesn't matter if they say the world is more open now,

113
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,350
it isn't easy for women to go into a full-body attack first, sober at that!

114
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,390
<i>Sleep with me tonight, Je Soo Ho.</i>

115
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,500
She was sober...and she said it easily too.

116
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,930
Really? Wait, but is it really not Seol Hee?

117
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,530
It's not? If it's not then who...

118
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,480
Don't tell me, it's Bo Nui?

119
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,710
We said she was terminal! That was her dying wish?

120
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,650
She's not a terminal, you stupid fly!

121
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,140
She's not? Then that's a relief!

122
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,020
Wait but why'd Bo Nui do that?

123
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,550
I said it's not Sim Bo Nui!

124
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,630
You can be scared.

125
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,100
I was scared in the beginning, I got scared too! Seeing like-wow, like I was scared!

126
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,350
The first is always like that, what's wrong with you?

127
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,450
This hyung is always praying for your beautiful first night.

128
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,940
Stop-it's hot, let go.

129
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,630
What, should I give you some tips?

130
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,320
Stop! Stop! Stop!

131
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,390
What are you doing here?

132
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,190
Just to get some air.

133
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,260
-Did that person leave?<br>-Yeah.

134
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,710
Why? Did he yell at you? Did he pick on you?!

135
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,590
-He said something worse after I left, huh!<br>-No!

136
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,960
What do you mean "no", it's written all over your face.

137
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,970
I said it's not.

138
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,970
I must've been to hasty, only thinking about myself.

139
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,900
That person, does he have the sign of a tiger?

140
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,030
-How did you know?<br>-What is it?

141
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,120
What are you supposed to do with a tiger that you're clinging on like this?

142
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,480
-I have to sleep with him.<br>-Stop making jokes.

143
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,090
I have to sleep with that person, that's how my Bo Ra will wake up.

144
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,070
What are you saying?

145
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,820
What's this about Bo Ra waking up and what's you having to sleep with a tiger?

146
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,390
Did the shaman say that?! That doesn't make sense-

147
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,200
You think...I'm delusional too, right?

148
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:29,580
I know, no matter who looks at it, this is crazy.

149
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,920
But I can stay still because of that?

150
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,720
How can I ignore that when Bo Ra's life is on the line?

151
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,740
<i>I ruined everything again.</i>

152
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,090
My head's going to explode,

153
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,130
thinking about where to find a tiger and how to start this again.

154
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,610
Let's go.

155
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,180
-Where?<br>-A good place.

156
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,570
<i>It has to be you.</i>

157
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,530
I said...it has to be you.

158
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,370
She made it clear from the beginning, she doesn't like you.

159
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,130
Where are we going!?

160
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,370
Hurry up! Come on!

161
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,260
You hold a racket,

162
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,050
from here and straight...

163
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,780
Hey! I've never played this before.

164
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,410
I'm going! Focus!

165
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,790
What are you doing-hey!

166
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,550
When your thoughts are cluttered, there's nothing better than moving around.

167
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,040
Seriously, trust me!

168
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,130

Noona.

That's right, cry it all out.

193

<i>You're angry, agitated, and frustrated too.</i>

194
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,990

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,550
Yeah, scream it out,

Mr. Choi Ho! Where are you!?

199
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,160
Bo Ra!

200
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,030
Wake up...

201
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,740
Wake up!

202
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,520
You're coming back now? You've got a package from Jemulpo!

203
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,140
<i>From Jemulpo, carp juice, fragile!</i>

204
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,200
You can have it.

205
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,440
Again? Thank you, rest up!

206
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,510
<i>It has to be you.</i>

207
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,670
That scared me!

208
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,810
<i>Hurry up and go! Okay!?</i>

209
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,860
-Do you feel better?<br>-Yeah.

210
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,100
Don't you have those times? When you want to go back to the past.

211
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,970
The night before I went to Canada.

212
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,490
Dad said we should sleep together one last time, but I said no.

213
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,040
Noona, what time do you want to go back to?

214
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,760
That day 2 years ago, the day Bo Ra got into that accident,

215
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,850
if I could go back to that morning,

216
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,060
I would do anything.

217
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,160
<i>Oppa!</i>

218
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,410
<i>You rascals!</i>

219
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,720
-Oppa! Oh my gosh-please sign this!<br>-I said get away!

220
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,180
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

221
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,500
This is my youngest daughter and she plays tennis!

222
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,350
She said she'll look just once from far away!

223
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,750
It's okay.

224
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,850
<i>Oppa you're so handsome!</i>

225
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,540
<i>Thank you!</i>

226
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,040
We love you Gary Choi!

227
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,330
<i>Study hard!</i>

228
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,600
<i>We love you Gary Choi!</i>

229
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,180
Gary Choi?

230
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,300
Gary Choi?!

231
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,490
You...

232
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,860
you're Gary Choi?!

233
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,110
<i>Excuse me! Room 402!</i>

234
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,260
<i>With that man, I have to...safely sleep...</i>

235
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,280
<i>He's like a younger brother, just overreacting because we grew up together!</i>

236
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,050
<i>I'm not overreactive, get out of the way!</i>

237
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,970
I mean, how could to fool me so perfectly?

238
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,250
I told you, I'm famous.

239
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,910
How am I supposed to know when you say it like that?

240
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,570
You just don't know because you have no interest.

241
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,010
Noona, you haven't asked once about what I've been doing with my life. I don't know who's sad about who.

242
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,870
Of course I thought you were unemployed! Always wearing a hat and dragging around slippers.

243
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,960
I did that on purpose because if word got out about me, the neighborhood would get crazy.

244
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,620
You saw that today right? You don't know how hard it was for me to hide this.

245
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,320
Hey!

246
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,330
But how can our Puccu be Gary Choi?

247
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,940
If I gave you an honest serve, you would've been taken to the hospital.

248
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,940
-Just keep that in mind.<br>-Thanks!

249
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,730
It's not that big of a deal...

250
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,860
For growing up so well.

251
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,970
Why am I so proud? Our Geon Wook, you've grown up so well!

252
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,990
I made a buttload of money too,

253
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,060
so don't worry! From now on, I'll be your support system!

254
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,520
If you have anything you need, tell me all of them!

255
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,190
It's fine!

256
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,970
What? What should I do for you?

257
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,680
The Canadian tiger you talked about last time...

258
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,100
Never mind.

259
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,790
Let's go inside!

263
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,430
<i>Miss Bo Nui! Look over my graphics, please?</i>

264
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,900
Of course.

265
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,820
How is it?

266
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,010
Miss Seung Yeon, have we seen Gary Choi's face before?

267
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,340
What are you talking about? We've seen so much of him!

268
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,730
This, this, and this too!

269
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,370
Why? Is the synchronization off? It's weird?

270
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,500
No! Not that,

271
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,500
-but Gary Choi-<br>-CEO!

272
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,930
<i>-O-Oh, CEO, you're here!</i><br>-We'll pass on the greetings!

273
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,680
Keep working!

274
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,900
Okay. That was smooth.

275
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,140
Why're you coming!?

276
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,590
Does that make sense!?

277
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,000
No-I mean, why's the service so faulty?!

278
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,530
<i>Who made the damn thing, huh!?</i>

279
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,530
That was smooth.

280
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,550

281
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,900
<i>CEO!</i>

282
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,130
Yes?

283
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,890
I have something to tell you.

284
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,630
I have a meeting I need to get to so...

285
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,450
-CEO!<br>-Yes?

286
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,430
But the meeting room's this way.

287
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,250
Yes.

288
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,020
<i>Name tag...</i>

289
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,440
<i>I'll look at the e-mail.</i>

290
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,480
<i>-Are you looking for someone?<br></i>-Sim Bo-

291
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,100
Are you...avoiding me?

292
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,330
No. Why would I?

293
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,280
This whole day...

294
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,740
It felt like we kept missing each other.

295
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,150
I don't understand at all.

296
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,330
You said you have something to tell me right? I have something to tell you too. Come in.

297
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,080
About yesterday...

298
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,300
I'm sorry.

299
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,090
-Are you saying you have nothing to do with this place anymore?<br>-No.

300
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,410
After yesterday, how could I possible see your face.

301
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,430
Why can't you? Nothing happened.

302
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,550
Do you...have lingering feelings? Or a different plan?

303
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,260
No! It's definitely not that!

304
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,270
I...It's because I was so desperate,

305
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,880
I made a mistake.

306
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,850
So you're running away?

307
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,420
I'm saying I'll take responsibility.

308
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,450
Why didn't you tell me?

309
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,360
Gary Choi. He's the little brother living next door to you, right?

310
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,730
-How did you know-<br>-Would you look at that? You knew all along.

311
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,970
-No!<br>-For someone with such a strong conviction for accountability,

312
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,830
how could keep crucial information a secret?!

313
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,580
Yes, well, I know you have no affections towards IF,

314
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,120
but still, IF was a game that started from you.

315
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,930
You know how important Gary Choi is to our development and you-

316
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,590
No! I found out yesterday night too!

317
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,210
Whatever! When you found out, whether he's your little brother or your dating partner, it doesn't matter!

318
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,400
<i>Get Gary Choi.</i>

319
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,560
-Excuse me?<br>-Get him to agree to be our model.

320
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,100
<i>That's</i> how you take responsibility, got it?

321
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:37,700
-Are you okay, CEO?<br>-What.

322
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,610
Seeing me.

323
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,080
Isn't it...uncomfortable?

324
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,560
I said yesterday that I respect your private life.

325
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,590
It's something that has nothing to do with me anymore anyways.

326
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,290
Yes.

327
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,140
I understand.

328
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,440
About Gary Choi, you can go through the process on your own.

329
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,060
The company will be going through the formal process on our own.

330
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,410
Yes.

331
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,960
CEO,

332
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,620
I like IF.

333
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,170
I made it, how could I not care for it.

334
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,270
But, this is Zeze.

335
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,480
Everyone is so great and skilled,

336
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,620
I thought it was beyond my place to tell them to do this and that.

337
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,990
But, more than anyone, I want IF to succeed.

338
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,620
I want someone to be able to experience a life they've only ever dreamed of.

339
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,960
And that's the heart,

340
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,470
I started with.

341
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,730
<i>I'm glad there's a place for me here.</i>

342
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,480
I'll...try my best to persuade him.

343
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,420
Be careful of the edges!

344
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,590
This is the last of the luggage, right?

345
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,290
You can move all of this to the 4th floor!

346
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,260
<i>Got it.</i>

347
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,620
Oh, I'm in the lobby right now!

348
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,360
Where are you? I'm...right in front of the screen door.

349
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,390
Which floor are you going into? The 1st or the 7th?

350
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,040
Here!

351
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,960
Here he comes.

352
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,270
You can come this way.

353
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,480
Why are you putting these here? You have to take them all up.

354
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,290
-I can only bring it here<br>-You can't enter without an entrance pass!

355
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,750
-Please work hard.<br>-Please get in safe.

356
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,910
No, what am I supposed to do with all this-hey, ahjusshi!

357
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,720
Wow, this isn't going to be easy. You're going to have to tell your employees to get down here.

358
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,730
We...don't have employees yet...

359
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,680
What should I do?

360
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,820
What's this? You're calling me?

361
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,170
Geon Wook, are you busy right now?

362
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,390
-Yeah, seriously busy.<br><i>-Oh, should I call you later?</i>

363
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,850
I'm ironing my super important red underwear.

364
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,470
The winning charm. Symbol of good luck, you know?

365
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,840
Of course, you're doing something very important.

366
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,160
But why?

367
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,790
Did you get fired?!

368
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:09,800
No...I was just wondering if I could see you when I get off work.

369
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:17,250
<i> Timing and subtitles brought to you by <br> The Lucky Team @ Viki </i>

370
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,430
How can I get in here?

371
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:26,420
No...you said...you were here for the 4th floor...this is the 8th...

372
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,230
I have to give out rice cakes!

373
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,780
Move, it's iris identification.

374
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,420
Wow, you have full clearance here!?

375
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,900
That's so cool!

376
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,690
I'm a major shareholder...damn...

377
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,510
-Hello!<br>-What-how did she?!

378
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,800
<i>Did you let her in!?</i>

379
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,710
-She's new to the 4th floor...<br>-IM Sports?

380
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,420
I'm the director of IM Sports's Korea branch, and also the one that just moved into the 4th floor, Han Seol Hee.

381
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,450
<i>-How did she get in here?<br>-That's what I'm wondering.</i>

382
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,370
<i>But why did the head of coffee carry that?</i>

383
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,100
<i>O-Oh...exactly...why-why did I bring this?</i>

384
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,100
They said you're supposed to pass out rice cakes when you move in in Korea.

385
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,650
<i>I was curious about the people who worked with CEO Je Soo Ho,</i>

386
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,850
I'll be seeing all of you often, I'm in your care.

387
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,740
Oh y-yes...

388
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,110
Come in.

389
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,190
O-Oh...S-Soo Ho! The thing is...

390
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,940
See me!

391
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,150
Ow! Ow, why are you pushing so much!

392
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,060
Ow!

393
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,160
You're a liar!

394
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,720
W-What? Liar? Why am I a liar?

395
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,610
You said you knew everything! That you were his guardian angel!

396
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,330
Saying femme fatale and acting like you knew her face and everything!

397
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,050
I just pretended not to know! I'm his friend,

398
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,100
you think it'd be okay for me to go around talking about the CEO's private life!?

399
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,420
Liar! I saw your face and everything!

400
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,630
You did that!

401
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,600
When did I do <i>this</i>!

402
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,500
That...was because she was so much prettier than her old pictures-

403
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,600
but Dal Nim...why are you arguing about that to me?

404
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,710
Looking at it again, back then you ran till you ran out of breath too!

405
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,820
That...was me, as his willing assistant,

406
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,550
trying to check every little change during a crucial time like this!

407
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:16,400
Me, I'm a person that adores every kind of love out there,

408
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,800
but there are just two that you <i>have</i> to be careful with.

409
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,940
Affairs and loyalty.

410
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,710
Don't be so loyal! Work as much as you receive!

411
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:31,420
Like...get a hobby and date around!

412
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,890
And, and when do you get rid of this, the wire bunch.

413
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,290
I'm not taking it off until I die!

414
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:41,090
Oh! It's horrifying! Ugh! It's going to come out in my dreams!

415
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:52,680
Wow, this is some top of the line, trendy designing, from a baby who only knew books.

416
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,720
-What in the world are you doing?<br>-Oh!

417
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,610
Do that for me too, the thing where the door opens when I show my eyes.

418
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,900
Have you received Gary Choi's agreement?

419
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:08,800
Mmm, I will soon. You know a lot of people want Gary, right?

420
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,710
I'll make sure you get a lot from me.

421
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,950
Why did you move into the 4th floor?

422
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,240
For business, I need an office,

423
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,040
and with my timing, the monthly rent was in range. It's also close to the sub-contractor, isn't it perfect?

424
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,840
Why? Did you think...that I moved here because of you?

425
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,540
As Zeze, I'll interpret it as determination from IM Sports.

426
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,120
Since the feedback was taking so long, we've taken a different route in contacting Gary Choi.

427
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,810
What is that supposed to mean?

428
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,190
No, how can you contact him when I'm the management?

429
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,990
You said the athlete's agreement was of utmost importance.

430
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,900
I handle Gary's contract, from a business to a business, this is rude.

431
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,590
Then what are we supposed to do? We're desperate and his management is taking their time.

432
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,840
We can only take the direct route.

433
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,380
Soo Ho, trust me.

434
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,800
You and me meeting again, being connected through Gary,

435
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,700
I don't think it's a coincidence.

436
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,790
Soo Ho!

437
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,600
We have something to talk about, hmm?

438
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,910
You're probably busy, you should head down.

439
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:29,640
Promise me, if I give you Gary Choi then you give me a pass to here.

440
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,870
Gary first.

441
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:38,820
Okay! Then, let's meet again soon, CEO Je.

442
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,470
She really does whatever she wants...

443
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,590
Mother...

444
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,480
Yes Seung Yeon?

445
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,000
<i>Come down for lunch, we're on the 1st floor right now.</i>

446
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh! Okay, I'll go right now!

447
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:14,010
Je So Hoo, now I'm under you.

448
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,980
<i>Amy</i>

449
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,220
Please check it.

450
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,730
We've made the name and number of the finder private,

451
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,990
we also put in the picture of the owl you told us about.

452
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,670
Yes, it's good. I'll leave things in your care.

453
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,200
Work hard.

454
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,960
<i>Searching for a person.</i><br>But since it's a recent picture, there's probably going to be a lot of people who recognize him, right?

455
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,990
Yeah. They said it was way better. It's all thanks to you.

456
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,820
-Here.<br>-I'll eat it on my own.

457
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,020
Hurry up!

458
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,200
This!

459
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,750
To be honest, I was in such a hurry because I had no time.

460
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,670
But, this time, I think I might be able to find him for real this time.

461
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,890
I just have a feeling.

462
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,090
When you're done with your break, are you going to Canada?

463
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,320
Why? Are you sad already?

464
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,300
Geon Wook, you got a proposal to be a model for a game, right?

465
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,480
How'd you know? This noona is suddenly so interested in me!

466
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,160
I got one but I said no. I'm a little too expensive.

467
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,340
But can't you do it?

468
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,790
The company I'm at is Zeze Factory.

469
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:48,020
Then...that tiger CEO guy is trying to get me as the model?

470
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,590
-What's "guy"!<br>-Well between two people who've used their fists!

471
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,440
...call each other "this guy" and "that guy"...

472
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,050
That game is my project.

473
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,480
The CEO picked up what almost got thrown away.

474
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,200
It's a really good game. You're giving other people the chance to live a great life as you!

475
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,560
Sorry, I can't do it.

476
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,750
Look for other people, not me.

477
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:20,180
There are so many great people in the world, what can you get from living as a person like me.

478
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,370
What's wrong with you?

479
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,270
I'm...

480
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,350
a son that's finding his dad after 10 years.

481
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,190
It's not great at all, it's not good.

482
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,030
Hey! You can find him now! You can meet him.

483
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,640
Yeah. I'm going to.

484
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,320
So I don't have time. Sorry Noona.

485
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,570
Oh you're at it again! The smell will get onto me again!

486
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,620
Be quiet.

487
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,040
You...tell the truth. Are you supporting two families?

488
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,140
What are you saying?

489
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,990
You make that carp juice with all the care in the world,

490
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,310
you don't think I'd notice you take out a box every single time?

491
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,410
They say carp is great for getting rid of bloating for pregnant women.

492
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,780
You're really spewing nonsense!

493
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,380
You need to be on the same wavelength for jokes, ugh!

494
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,820
Where are you going?

495
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,290
Where would I go! I'm going to give my son-

496
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,220
I said don't go!

497
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,270
What do you expect from a kid who can't even treat his parents right!?

498
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,610
Maybe for you because you make a mess after you're drunk!

499
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,230
But I'm treated like an elegant madam!

500
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,070
As if!

501
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,300
You're smart, graceful,

502
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,360
as expected from Je Soo Ho's mother!

503
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,960
I can't even go into my son's company when I want to!

504
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,130
Miss! The wall talisman miss, from last time?

505
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,480
Yes! Hello.

506
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,020
Are you really sure? You put it in well?

507
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,070
Yes, I hid it well in the book furthest in the corner.

508
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,650
But why's he like this?

509
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,430

511
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,220
it's a talisman that wards off raccoons and let's him get closer to women.

512
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,640
He said that Soo Ho would be good to me too because I'm a woman.

513
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,310
A raccoon?

514
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,760
They said a wicked raccoon's attached to Soo Ho!

515
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,600

<i>That raccoon...it must be me.</i>

524
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,870
Huh?

525
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,070
Oh, I wonder.

526
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,960
I'm on contract so I don't really with the CEO.

527
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,340
A really persistent one must be on him.

528

609
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,410
Who?

610
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,400
Mr. Choi Ho. This...he looks like this.

611
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,890

00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,420
Where is he right now? Is he inside?

614
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,460
He's not here anymore. He doesn't live here.

615
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,820
When did he leave?

616
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,620

617
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,560
<i>I think it was around mid-January.</i>

618
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,970
<i>He's always been so diligent and quiet, I didn't even know he'd been coming and going.</i>

619
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,660
<i>But he just cleaned everything up,</i>

620
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:38,380
and left without a word, leaving all his stuff too!

621
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,610

What is that supposed to mean?

625
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,770
No no, it's because I'm short on cash right now,

626
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,600
I'm about to lose a really good item!

627
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,640
What's this about an item all of a sudden, what are you doing?

628
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,090
Is it stolen goods this time?

629
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,950
No no! It's not like that.

630
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,710

632
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,700
I'll get money-I'll give you the money back by tonight!

633
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,350
It's night right now. And I don't have money, I also can't pick up calls from now on.

00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,040
Thanks Noona.

682
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,870
Hurry inside and get a lot of rest!

683
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,080
<i>CEO</i>

684
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,590
CEO!

685
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:36,480
-From now on, answer honestly to everything I ask.<br>-What?

686
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,330
Promise me!

687
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,030
That you'll tell the truth about everything.

688
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,310
-Yes.<br>-That day,

689
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:47,300
you told me it had to be me, that it could only be me.

690
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,110
-Yes.<br>-Because I have the sign of a tiger?

691
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:00,630
So...during those barbaric times,

692
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,760
how a paying guest would offer a woman,

693
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,860
the way you offer up an animal,

694
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:11,330
did you use me as an offering because I had the sign of a tiger?

695
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,670
I'm sorry.

696
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,380
I'm really, really sorry-I should've told you beforehand,

697
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,850
but if I said that, I thought you would treat like a delusional person-

698
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,530
You're more scary than I thought.

699
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,010
Is it fun using people?

700
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:37,330
When did it start? The casino? The demonstration? The recruitment!

701
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:41,700
It's not a game and it's not a joke? I'm a nice person?

702
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:46,880
What's the reason you're like this, why are you doing something as crazy as this, why!?

703
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,170
I was listening and figured you were crossing the line.

704
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,170
Geon Wook.

705
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,380
Leave. This is between us.

706
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:59,380
So what. It's not like the two of you had a one-night stand and it's not like the two of you were dating,

707
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,770
why are you so mad?

708
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,140
Don't tell me...did you think she loved you?

709
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,440
Let's go Noona.

710
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,890
Wait, wait!

711
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,220
You go ahead.

712
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,480
-Noona!<br>-That person,

713
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,260
I can't send him back like this.

714
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,790
I want to go back and explain to him. That it was to safe Bo Ra, that I'm sorry.

715
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,360
And if you do? Did that person say he'd do what you wanted?

716
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,260
You saw how he cornered you! No matter what you tell him, he won't understand.

717
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,780
If you go back, you'll just hear worse things, don't go.

718
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,330
I'm going back to hear those things.

719
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,370
How surprised do you think he was? How angry?

720
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:59,160
If he can forgive me just a little bit by screaming at me and pouring it on me,

721
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,030
that's fine. "Crazy bitch", "Delusional", "Screw loose", I've heard those things countless times,

722
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:11,070
so go inside, you must be tired. Don't think about anything today and get a lot of rest!

723
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:19,120
<i>It's not like the two of you had a one-night stand and it's not like the two of you were dating,</i>

01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,960

731
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:24,680
A talisman...that seduces men?
