1
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,140
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,610
<font color="yellow">We only took a week-long break,</font>

3
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,750
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't wait for our class to begin again.</font>

4
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,260
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

5
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,370
<font color="yellow">- Good.
-  Good.</font>

6
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,770
<font color="yellow">I missed our pretty teacher.</font>

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,790
<font color="yellow">I missed you, too.</font>

8
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,770
<font color="yellow">- Me, too.
-  Me, too.</font>

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,070
<font color="yellow">Today, you'll learn how to make video calls...</font>

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,440
<font color="yellow">and how to use messenger services.</font>

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,500
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Okay.</font>

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,400
<font color="yellow">Did you call him again?</font>

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,700
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop bothering him when he's busy.</font>

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't call him.</font>

15
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,440
<font color="yellow">I set his place just in case he comes.</font>

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,750
<font color="yellow">Why do you call Yeong Il all the time then?</font>

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,980
<font color="yellow">Is he a spy or what?</font>

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,760
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask him about your son?</font>

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,870
<font color="yellow">Am I not allowed to even worry?</font>

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,180
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,140
<font color="yellow">- Put that away.
-  Please, just once.</font>

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,200
<font color="yellow">- No way.
-  Give it a try.</font>

23
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,340
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho!</font>

24
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,170
<font color="yellow">I couldn't ask for anything more.</font>

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,000
<font color="yellow">When was the last time we gathered together for a birthday?</font>

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,960
<font color="yellow">Has it been 18 years or 20?</font>

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,970
<font color="yellow">It's been 21 years.</font>

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,300
<font color="yellow">Let's celebrate birthdays together every year from now on.</font>

29
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,940
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

30
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,170
<font color="yellow">It would be great if she was here on this festive day with us.</font>

31
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,640
<font color="yellow">I wonder how that small and fragile girl is doing.</font>

32
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,870
<font color="yellow">How could she not call us even once?</font>

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,150
<font color="yellow">Soo Ho, I don't go to the fortune-teller any more.</font>

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,370
<font color="yellow">I got upset thinking about it.</font>

35
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,670
<font color="yellow">He called that pretty girl a raccoon.</font>

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,210
<font color="yellow">I can't trust him any more.</font>

37
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,940
<font color="yellow">I don't believe what he says.</font>

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,370
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,140
<font color="yellow">Enjoy the food.</font>

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,040
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Min Jae.</font>

41
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

42
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,750
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,560
<font color="yellow">He won the junior match and made a debut on television.</font>

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,980
<font color="yellow">Everything is happening all at once.</font>

45
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,870
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I should be taking gifts from you.</font>

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,620
<font color="yellow">You're going to get busier from now on.</font>

47
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,400
<font color="yellow">He's going to be so successful that you won't be able to handle alone.</font>

48
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,570
<font color="yellow">Now is the time you should hire a professional.</font>

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,770
<font color="yellow">What do I have to do for you to trust me?</font>

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,980
<font color="yellow">The other companies are bigger...</font>

51
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,040
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

52
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,970
<font color="yellow">This makes me sad.</font>

53
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,580
<font color="yellow">I've told you this before,</font>

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,650
<font color="yellow">but I am so much better...</font>

55
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,370
<font color="yellow">than any other big companies.</font>

56
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,070
<font color="yellow">If you could just talk to Gary Choi for five minutes,</font>

57
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,750
<font color="yellow">you'd realise that.</font>

58
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,770
<font color="yellow">You're lying, aren't you?</font>

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,070
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

60
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,100
<font color="yellow">That you were Gary Choi's agent.</font>

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,170
<font color="yellow">How many times have I told you?</font>

62
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,270
<font color="yellow">I met him when he was so cheeky just like you now.</font>

63
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,240
<font color="yellow">We made it to the top together.</font>

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,070
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you working with him any longer then?</font>

65
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,870
<font color="yellow">I read it on the internet that IM Sports fired you.</font>

66
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,000
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300
<font color="yellow">I didn't get fired!</font>

68
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,800
<font color="yellow">Min Jae has to first learn how to be on an interview.</font>

69
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,740
<font color="yellow">Min Jae, if you talk rudely like that,</font>

70
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,740
<font color="yellow">the news reporters won't like you. Do you know that?</font>

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
<font color="yellow">Amy.</font>

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,470
<font color="yellow">Gary!</font>

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,310
<font color="yellow">Hey, how can you surprise me like this?</font>

74
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,870
<font color="yellow">It's fun. I had a shooting here,</font>

75
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,250
<font color="yellow">and you had a meeting here.</font>

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,940
<font color="yellow">Anyway, that was perfect timing.</font>

77
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,860
<font color="yellow">What are you here for today? Interview?</font>

78
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

79
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,240
<font color="yellow">You're now like a complete professional.</font>

80
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,100
<font color="yellow">A year ago, you became shy...</font>

81
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,510
<font color="yellow">doing a motion capture.</font>

82
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,780
<font color="yellow">Don't even mention it.</font>

83
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,990
<font color="yellow">When I think about what I did with Mr Je, gosh...</font>

84
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,770
<font color="yellow">Why? You two looked good together.</font>

85
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,700
<font color="yellow">There was a strange chemistry between you two.</font>

86
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,640
<font color="yellow">How's work?</font>

87
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,340
<font color="yellow">Well, working alone is...</font>

88
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,800
<font color="yellow">really killing me.</font>

89
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,970
<font color="yellow">I don't have any title or money.</font>

90
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,740
<font color="yellow">It's really tough to find an athlete who will trust me for who I am.</font>

91
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,150
<font color="yellow">Things will turn out well.</font>

92
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,840
<font color="yellow">Whoever it is, the athlete who works with you is very lucky.</font>

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,950
<font color="yellow">Hey. Don't do it.</font>

94
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,980
<font color="yellow">I might really cry.</font>

95
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,840
<font color="yellow">I cry whenever someone says something slightly touching.</font>

96
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,940
<font color="yellow">You look good. Your face is glowing.</font>

97
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,600
<font color="yellow">So do you.</font>

98
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,200
<font color="yellow">How can you be so successful without me?</font>

99
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,170
<font color="yellow">You won the Wimbledon,</font>

100
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,400
<font color="yellow">and you were the cover model of "Time".</font>

101
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,570
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

102
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,540
<font color="yellow">I am so proud of my athlete.</font>

103
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,170
<font color="yellow">Why are you like this? We talked about this on the phone already.</font>

104
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

105
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,500
<font color="yellow">You're seeing someone, aren't you?</font>

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,100
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

107
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,580
<font color="yellow">I can never reach you. Your phone is always busy.</font>

108
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,090
<font color="yellow">Time's up. I have to go in.</font>

109
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,970
<font color="yellow">Look at how you change the subject.</font>

110
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,050
<font color="yellow">Anyway, wait for me. Let's go to Zeze Factory together.</font>

111
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,500
<font color="yellow">You know today's the day of IF's re-release, right?</font>

112
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
<font color="yellow">You go alone.</font>

113
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,650
<font color="yellow">I don't work for IM Sports any more, and I'm no longer your agent.</font>

114
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,540
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that. You've been there since the start.</font>

115
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,540
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting with a promising swimmer.</font>

116
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,270
<font color="yellow">He will get me a gold medal on the coming Olympics.</font>

117
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,800
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving. Good luck with the interview.</font>

118
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,500
<font color="yellow">Cheer up!</font>

119
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
<font color="yellow">Mr Je.</font>

120
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,540
<font color="yellow">I organised a list of game start-up companies.</font>

121
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,540
<font color="yellow">Okay. Send me the file.</font>

122
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

123
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,480
<font color="yellow">(List of Game Start-ups)</font>

124
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,790
<font color="yellow">Did you hand-write all of these?</font>

125
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,770
<font color="yellow">I wrote every word with love.</font>

126
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,870
<font color="yellow">Properly!</font>

127
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,270
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable.</font>

128
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,340
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievably useless.</font>

129
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,800
<font color="yellow">As you know,</font>

130
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,570
<font color="yellow">this is Daebak Soft.</font>

131
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,770
<font color="yellow">This is Daebak Soft.</font>

132
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,400
<font color="yellow">You can't become successful with this.</font>

133
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,770
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

134
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,870
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

135
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,070
<font color="yellow">- And...
-  Yes?</font>

136
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,870
<font color="yellow">You should sign up for a computer class.</font>

137
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,100
<font color="yellow">You should start learning how to use the tools. I will pay for it.</font>

138
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,860
<font color="yellow">He's learning hard from me.</font>

139
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,570
<font color="yellow">He's improving, so don't worry.</font>

140
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,870
<font color="yellow">He's improving, and yet, he wrote all of these by hand.</font>

141
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,350
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

142
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,040
<font color="yellow">- This is a happy day!
-  Hello.</font>

143
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,670
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

144
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,500
<font color="yellow">It's been a year!</font>

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,600
<font color="yellow">Finally, IF is out!</font>

146
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,120
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
-  Wait.</font>

147
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,170
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

148
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,340
<font color="yellow">thought deeply about it.</font>

149
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
<font color="yellow">But as you know,</font>

150
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,000
<font color="yellow">IF was first designed here.</font>

151
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,350
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I think about it, I need to be there.</font>

152
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,400
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

153
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,270
<font color="yellow">Why would he...</font>

154
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,500
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought,</font>

155
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,040
<font color="yellow">but I shouldn't probably go there.</font>

156
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,600
<font color="yellow">Are you done planning for the new game?</font>

157
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,060
<font color="yellow">- Not yet.
-  What are you going to do?</font>

158
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,470
<font color="yellow">Gosh, time is ticking, and investors are very anxious.</font>

159
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,400
<font color="yellow">Having heard that you are releasing a new game after a year,</font>

160
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,760
<font color="yellow">everyone keep calling me. They're excited to see it.</font>

161
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,770
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

162
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,670
<font color="yellow">You must have something in mind.</font>

163
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,190
<font color="yellow">The largest shareholder of Daebak Soft is getting really excited.</font>

164
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,800
<font color="yellow">There aren't any shares for it. How are you the shareholder?</font>

165
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,110
<font color="yellow">- When you first began, I...
-  What?</font>

166
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,940
<font color="yellow">Is this about how you paid the rent for two months?</font>

167
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,640
<font color="yellow">That's not much. I already paid you back.</font>

168
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,210
<font color="yellow">- I also paid for...
-  Electricity bills, right?</font>

169
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,960
<font color="yellow">You don't even let us turn on the air conditioner. Gosh.</font>

170
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,230
<font color="yellow">- I...
-  It's about Mr Won, isn't it?</font>

171
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,140
<font color="yellow">That jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk don't cost much. Gosh.</font>

172
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,700
<font color="yellow">Can you read my mind?</font>

173
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,860
<font color="yellow">Anyway, once a major shareholder, always a major shareholder.</font>

174
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,110
<font color="yellow">If Daebak Soft goes public, I will buy all the shares.</font>

175
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,270
<font color="yellow">So this deal is really important.</font>

176
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,700
<font color="yellow">You have to do well. Okay?</font>

177
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,870
<font color="yellow">Okay? Answer me.</font>

178
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,640
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

180
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

181
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,050
<font color="yellow">- Yoon Bal,
-  Yes.</font>

182
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,740
<font color="yellow">How many hours have we been up?</font>

183
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,300
<font color="yellow">It's 73 hours and about 30 minutes.</font>

184
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I'm dying.</font>

185
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,770
<font color="yellow">I need to watch my youngest child walk before I die.</font>

186
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,370
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense.</font>

187
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,170
<font color="yellow">IF will be re-released today,</font>

188
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,700
<font color="yellow">and Mr Je will return.</font>

189
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,170
<font color="yellow">How nice is that?</font>

190
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,400
<font color="yellow">I think I'm going to become neurotic.</font>

191
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,490
<font color="yellow">Final check. Final check one.</font>

192
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,870
<font color="yellow">Final check 1.1. Final check 1.2. Final check 2. Final check...</font>

193
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,500
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many final checks? Am I "AlphaGo" or what?</font>

194
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,040
<font color="yellow">But thanks to you, we released IF successfully.</font>

195
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
<font color="yellow">How nice is that?</font>

196
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,270
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and get out.</font>

197
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,700
<font color="yellow">- No. I'm not going out.
-  Please wait a little.</font>

198
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,840
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je is here!
-  What?</font>

199
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
<font color="yellow">Go! Go!</font>

200
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,790
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

201
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Seriously.</font>

202
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,830
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on the successful relaunch of IF.</font>

203
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,440
<font color="yellow">Father of IF, Mr Je will give a congratulatory speech.</font>

204
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,270
<font color="yellow">Here's the mic.</font>

205
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,670
<font color="yellow">Because I'm your lady.</font>

206
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,570
<font color="yellow">And you are my man.</font>

207
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,630
<font color="yellow">I only came to congratulate you.</font>

208
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,790
<font color="yellow">I came to applaud.</font>

209
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,570
<font color="yellow">The candles are melting. Hurry up.</font>

210
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,440
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up.
-  Hurry.</font>

211
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

212
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,770
<font color="yellow">It was very like Zeze Factory.</font>

213
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,970
<font color="yellow">You did a splendid job.</font>

214
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,060
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's blow it out on the count of three.</font>

215
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,700
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2 and 3.</font>

216
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,500
<font color="yellow">You're coming back, right?</font>

217
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,390
<font color="yellow">Of course. He's the reason we stayed up all night.</font>

218
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,120
<font color="yellow">- Come back,
-  Come back,</font>

219
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je!
-  Mr Je!</font>

220
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
<font color="yellow">- Come back,
-  Come back,</font>

221
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,070
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je!
-  Mr Je Soo Ho!</font>

222
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,440
<font color="yellow">- Come back!
-  Mr Je!</font>

223
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,650
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je!
-  By the way,</font>

224
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,540
<font color="yellow">I want to see the mother of IF, too. How is Bo Nui doing?</font>

225
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,800
<font color="yellow">- Why? Why?
-  Be quiet.</font>

226
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,370
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

227
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,970
<font color="yellow">Everyone.</font>

228
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
<font color="yellow">I work for...</font>

229
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,670
<font color="yellow">Daebak Soft now.</font>

230
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,870
<font color="yellow">I will work hard so that it will pose a threat...</font>

231
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,550
<font color="yellow">to Zeze Factory one day.</font>

232
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,370
<font color="yellow">Okay. I look forward to seeing that.</font>

233
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,400
<font color="yellow">I hope it thrives, Mr Je.</font>

234
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,600
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat.
-  Bring a knife to cut the cake.</font>

236
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,400
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra.</font>

237
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,400
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra.</font>

238
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
<font color="yellow">(Bo Nui, I'm going to Seoul. Don't worry about me!)</font>

239
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,740
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, I am going to Seoul. Don't worry about me.</font>

240
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,370
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this?</font>

241
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,500
<font color="yellow">Can you help me?</font>

242
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,540
<font color="yellow">- Me?
-  Help me.</font>

243
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,970
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I can't go up there.</font>

244
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,100
<font color="yellow">Can you push me from the back?</font>

245
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,970
<font color="yellow">Is it your first time to see someone on a wheelchair?</font>

246
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,770
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. I have to go.</font>

247
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

248
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,470
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

249
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,370
<font color="yellow">Are you alone?</font>

250
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,170
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

251
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,340
<font color="yellow">Are you not with your family or friends?</font>

252
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not a kid.</font>

253
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,140
<font color="yellow">I took a bus and a taxi alone to get here.</font>

254
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,470
<font color="yellow">That's impressive.</font>

255
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,070
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

256
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,100
<font color="yellow">do you know where Zeze Factory is?</font>

257
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,870
<font color="yellow">I heard it's around here.</font>

258
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
<font color="yellow">Why are you going there?</font>

259
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,640
<font color="yellow">I have to meet someone there.</font>

260
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,170
<font color="yellow">It's close by. I'll take you.</font>

261
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,370
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

262
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,140
<font color="yellow">Have we...</font>

263
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

264
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,240
<font color="yellow">We couldn't have met.</font>

265
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,340
<font color="yellow">Why does his voice sound familiar?</font>

266
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,470
<font color="yellow">Could he be a voice actor?</font>

267
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,870
<font color="yellow">Are you a voice actor?</font>

268
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,600
<font color="yellow">I hear that a lot.</font>

269
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,770
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim, I don't know what to do. Bo Ra disappeared.</font>

270
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,860
<font color="yellow">Where could she be?</font>

271
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,970
<font color="yellow">- Bo Nui.
-  I'm sorry,</font>

272
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,570
<font color="yellow">but I'll call you back later.</font>

273
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,870
<font color="yellow">She's here.</font>

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,540
<font color="yellow">Your sister is at Zeze Factory now.</font>

275
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,600
<font color="yellow">Shim Bo Nui.</font>

276
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
<font color="yellow">(Shim Bo Nui)</font>

277
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,700
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra, you should've called me beforehand.</font>

278
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,070
<font color="yellow">Then you would have told Bo Nui.</font>

279
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,400
<font color="yellow">You should come with Bo Nui.</font>

280
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,340
<font color="yellow">It's dangerous to come alone.</font>

281
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,670
<font color="yellow">This is my special operation.</font>

282
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,870
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
-  Dal Nim.</font>

283
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,000
<font color="yellow">Call Mr Je Soo Ho for me.</font>

284
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,400
<font color="yellow">- Who?
-  Your boss.</font>

285
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,500
<font color="yellow">I mean your former boss.</font>

286
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,140
<font color="yellow">I came, thinking he'd be here on a day like this.</font>

287
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,840
<font color="yellow">He came and left.</font>

288
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,570
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

289
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
<font color="yellow">I was too late.</font>

290
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,370
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't gotten caught in front...</font>

291
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,610
<font color="yellow">What did you want to meet him for?</font>

292
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,440
<font color="yellow">Did Bo Nui say something?</font>

293
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,740
<font color="yellow">No, the problem is that she doesn't.</font>

294
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,140
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui tells me everything.</font>

295
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,840
<font color="yellow">She told me about working at the convenience store...</font>

296
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,340
<font color="yellow">and what she had for lunch every day.</font>

297
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,920
<font color="yellow">But she won't say a thing about Zeze Factory...</font>

298
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,400
<font color="yellow">or Mr Je Soo Ho.</font>

299
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,570
<font color="yellow">There are things you can't dare talk about...</font>

300
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,440
<font color="yellow">because it hurts too much to even think.</font>

301
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,300
<font color="yellow">That's why I can tell she's hiding something.</font>

302
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,270
<font color="yellow">I wanted to meet him and find out what it is.</font>

303
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,070
<font color="yellow">Too bad.</font>

304
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,870
<font color="yellow">Is that so? Gosh.</font>

305
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,970
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
-  Thank you.</font>

306
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,000
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

307
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,470
<font color="yellow">We should be giving you a gift.</font>

308
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,490
<font color="yellow">You all worked hard.</font>

309
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,240
<font color="yellow">You made my life look much better than the actual one.</font>

310
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,870
<font color="yellow">The model is just so amazing.</font>

311
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,100
<font color="yellow">I watched the Wimbledon game.</font>

312
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,870
<font color="yellow">It was the best.</font>

313
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,220
<font color="yellow">We got together to watch it.</font>

314
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,500
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to lose during the fourth match.</font>

315
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,600
<font color="yellow">- My heart skipped a beat.
-  I almost had a heart attack.</font>

316
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,330
<font color="yellow">- I'm not kidding.
-  Thank you.</font>

317
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,740
<font color="yellow">I was able to win thanks to your encouragement.</font>

318
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,700
<font color="yellow">People went crazy...</font>

319
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,940
<font color="yellow">when the camera found your dad in the audience.</font>

320
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,690
<font color="yellow">I cried a little.</font>

321
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,340
<font color="yellow">As we developed the game, I saw things on your point of view.</font>

322
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,860
<font color="yellow">It made me empathise with you so much.</font>

323
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,570
<font color="yellow">Just the sight of your father brings tears to my eyes.</font>

324
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,470
<font color="yellow">- He's overreacting.
-  You should look in the mirror.</font>

325
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,570
<font color="yellow">That would surprise the tears away.</font>

326
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,270
<font color="yellow">Why are you picking on him?</font>

327
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,270
<font color="yellow">Hyeon Bin is nice and has a soft heart.</font>

328
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,940
<font color="yellow">Isn't Mr Je here?</font>

329
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,670
<font color="yellow">You just missed him.</font>

330
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,940
<font color="yellow">You know that he's like the wind.</font>

331
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,860
<font color="yellow">We could've taken pictures of you two if you had been here earlier.</font>

332
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,700
<font color="yellow">- I know.
-  It must have been nice.</font>

333
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,390
<font color="yellow">Hi, Bo Ra.</font>

334
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,940
<font color="yellow">Guess where I am.</font>

335
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

336
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,200
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

337
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,670
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

338
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,970
<font color="yellow">What is Bo Ra doing here?</font>

339
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,840
<font color="yellow">She came to visit.</font>

340
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,000
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui will be here soon.</font>

341
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,030
<font color="yellow">Can you stay with her?</font>

342
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,540
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting with reporters.</font>

343
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,810
<font color="yellow">Of course. You can go.</font>

344
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,150
<font color="yellow">Wow, this is amazing.</font>

345
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,550
<font color="yellow">It looks so real.</font>

346
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,640
<font color="yellow">I felt like I was on a plane and in the sea.</font>

347
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,170
<font color="yellow">My sister really made this?</font>

348
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,740
<font color="yellow">- Bo Nui did?
-  Yes.</font>

349
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,310
<font color="yellow">She made this, thinking about you.</font>

350
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,170
<font color="yellow">You're the model.</font>

351
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,110
<font color="yellow">But she thought about me?</font>

352
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,000
<font color="yellow">She wanted to show you the beautiful things in life.</font>

353
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,700
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to be the model, but changed my mind after hearing that.</font>

354
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,340
<font color="yellow">So be nice to your sister.</font>

355
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,040
<font color="yellow">Geon Uk, since I met you...</font>

356
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,310
<font color="yellow">Can I get your autograph?</font>

357
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,340
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

358
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,310
<font color="yellow">My friends don't believe that I'm close to you.</font>

359
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,870
<font color="yellow">Can I get 10 autographs?</font>

360
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,600
<font color="yellow">- Is 10 enough?
-  Yes.</font>

361
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,200
<font color="yellow">You look more handsome than before.</font>

362
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,740
<font color="yellow">Even your autograph looks cool.</font>

363
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,540
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

364
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,140
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

365
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,070
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2...</font>

366
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,670
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra.</font>

367
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,240
<font color="yellow">- Did you call her?
-  I thought you told her.</font>

368
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,370
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you answering your phone? You scared me.</font>

369
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

370
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,700
<font color="yellow">You should've told me beforehand.</font>

371
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,810
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

372
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,940
<font color="yellow">She made it here safely and I'm here for her.</font>

373
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,240
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, I heard you made this.</font>

374
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,870
<font color="yellow">I didn't know because you didn't tell me.</font>

375
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
<font color="yellow">Did you really start making it because of me?</font>

376
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,970
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

377
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,070
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable.</font>

378
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,540
<font color="yellow">It's like a dream. A very good dream.</font>

379
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,540
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Bo Nui.</font>

380
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

381
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,240
<font color="yellow">She drives me nuts.</font>

382
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,500
<font color="yellow">Puberty must have hit her late. She keeps calling you, doesn't she?</font>

383
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,470
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Talking to her on the phone doesn't bother me.</font>

384
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,870
<font color="yellow">I'm proud of her. She made it all the way here alone.</font>

385
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't know this day would come.</font>

386
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,670
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

387
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,170
<font color="yellow">How is your dad? Is he doing well?</font>

388
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, he told me to thank you...</font>

389
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,940
<font color="yellow">for sending him food and clothes.</font>

390
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,240
<font color="yellow">I should go see him in person.</font>

391
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,440
<font color="yellow">Let's get dinner with my dad and Bo Ra later.</font>

392
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,940
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  I told you to come to my match.</font>

393
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,470
<font color="yellow">You wasted the tickets I sent you.</font>

394
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,540
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there will be an opportunity someday.</font>

395
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,400
<font color="yellow">You haven't been here for a while, have you?</font>

396
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,600
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't.</font>

397
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,370
<font color="yellow">Everything looks the same.</font>

398
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,270
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live there forever?</font>

399
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,170
<font color="yellow">I think Bo Ra is starting to feel suffocated there,</font>

400
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,670
<font color="yellow">and it'd be better for you to work if you move to Seoul.</font>

401
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,200
<font color="yellow">I might move someday.</font>

402
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,540
<font color="yellow">You never know what will happen in the future.</font>

403
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,300
<font color="yellow">I thought you left without seeing me.</font>

404
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,850
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I want the wedding invitation.</font>

405
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,270
<font color="yellow">You never disappoint me.</font>

406
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,070
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

407
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,670
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim!</font>

408
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,540
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty.</font>

409
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,130
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy for you.</font>

410
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,340
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

411
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,440
<font color="yellow">This is all thanks to you.</font>

412
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,400
<font color="yellow">It was your love that did all the work.</font>

413
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,940
<font color="yellow">You're marrying the person you had a crush on for two years.</font>

414
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,840
<font color="yellow">What crush?</font>

415
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,560
<font color="yellow">- That isn't true.
-  You don't have to hide it.</font>

416
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,960
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you the truth.</font>

417
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,040
<font color="yellow">Did you have a crush on someone else?</font>

418
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,800
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

419
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,440
<font color="yellow">No, don't tell me. It'll only concern me.</font>

420
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,340
<font color="yellow">The person that makes you happy now is the best.</font>

421
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,070
<font color="yellow">Have a happy life together.</font>

422
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,300
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

423
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
<font color="yellow">You have to come to the wedding.</font>

424
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,770
<font color="yellow">I'm not starting the wedding until you arrive, okay?</font>

425
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,840
<font color="yellow">Is it because you might run into him?</font>

426
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,840
<font color="yellow">Look, Bo Nui.</font>

427
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,070
<font color="yellow">You can't avoid him forever.</font>

428
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,740
<font color="yellow">People that are meant to meet will meet sooner or later.</font>

429
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,570
<font color="yellow">I'll be there.</font>

430
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,870
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

431
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,870
<font color="yellow">You promised me.</font>

432
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,200
<font color="yellow">(Daebak Soft)</font>

433
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
<font color="yellow">(Properly)</font>

434
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,600
<font color="yellow">She will walk and run any time soon.</font>

435
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,470
<font color="yellow">Good job, Bo Nui.</font>

436
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,440
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

437
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,770
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

438
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,270
<font color="yellow">Take it out.</font>

439
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,470
<font color="yellow">I saw it when I went to Zeze Factory, so I took one.</font>

440
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,540
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui,</font>

441
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
<font color="yellow">apply for this contest.</font>

442
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,970
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

443
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,500
<font color="yellow">I know you're developing a game every night.</font>

444
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,500
<font color="yellow">To be honest, playing IF made me realise...</font>

445
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,340
<font color="yellow">that you are the best.</font>

446
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,540
<font color="yellow">I'm certain you're going to win.</font>

447
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,270
<font color="yellow">Bo Ra, you're good at sweet-talking.</font>

448
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,510
<font color="yellow">I mean it, though.</font>

449
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,440
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Let's go in.</font>

450
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

451
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,020
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim. It's me, Bo Ra.</font>

452
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,310
<font color="yellow">Did you give it to her?</font>

453
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,740
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

454
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,700
<font color="yellow">But I don't know if she will do it or not.</font>

455
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,790
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

456
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,100
<font color="yellow">The winner gets 50,000-dollar cash prize.</font>

457
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,870
<font color="yellow">People have to be free of...</font>

458
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,700
<font color="yellow">financial problems to start seeing other things.</font>

459
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,570
<font color="yellow">I hope she applies.</font>

460
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,170

<font color="yellow">Why did you come here again?</font>

467
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,490
<font color="yellow">I came because I missed you.</font>

468

476
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,500
<font color="yellow">Why don't you plan our future first?</font>

480
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,180
<font color="yellow">their love toward each other will explode.</font>

620
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,770
<font color="yellow">You have to eat.</font>

621
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,810
<font color="yellow">Food is important.</font>

622
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,400

623
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,710

00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,800

628
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,600
<font color="yellow">Get more sleep.</font>

629
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,070
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, I had another nightmare.</font>

630
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,070
<font color="yellow">It's just a dream. You'll be okay.</font>

631
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,170
<font color="yellow">I'm right here next to you, so don't worry and sleep.</font>

632

<font color="yellow">Bo Nui.</font>

634
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,470
<font color="yellow">I was always waiting for you at the hospital.</font>

635
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,970
<font color="yellow">I waited for you to come and hold my hand.</font>

636
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,960

639
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,470

640
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,670
<font color="yellow">I wondered when I'd hear your voice.</font>

641
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,470

642

643
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,710

644
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,670
<font color="yellow">Why would anything bad happen to me?</font>

645
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,210
<font color="yellow">I felt so much better after hearing your voice.</font>

646
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,640
<font color="yellow">Didn't I start getting better after you visited me?</font>

647
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,000
<font color="yellow">Since you came with that man.</font>

648
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,670
<font color="yellow">Do you remember everything?</font>

649
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,840
<font color="yellow">I don't remember his face.</font>

650
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

651
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,540
<font color="yellow">I keep replaying his voice in my head.</font>

652
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,040
<font color="yellow">She tried hard to save you.</font>

653
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,670
<font color="yellow">So hurry up and get better.</font>

654
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,440
<font color="yellow">Tell her with confidence for me.</font>

655
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,640
<font color="yellow">Tell her to be happy.</font>

656
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,640

661
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,570

<font color="yellow">You visit our office over a dozen times a day.</font>

806
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,340
<font color="yellow">Do we have to greet you every single time?</font>

807

<font color="yellow">Whatever. Let's forget it. No picnic for today!</font>

954
