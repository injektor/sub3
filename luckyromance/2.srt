00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:40,208
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

2
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,378
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Stay calm.</font>

3
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:57,008
<font color="yellow">Find a man born in the year of the tiger, and spend a night with him.</font>

4
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,908
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, she'll die.</font>

5
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:10,738
<font color="yellow">I can do this.</font>

6
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:15,108
<font color="yellow">This body will rot away when I die anyway.</font>

7
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,378
<font color="yellow">This is nothing.</font>

8
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:23,938
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to save your body,</font>

9
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:25,108
<font color="yellow">but your money.</font>

10
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:28,538
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm going to love him. I can't fall in love with him.</font>

11
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:30,338
<font color="yellow">I won't even see him again after this.</font>

12
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,208
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>

13
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:35,938
<font color="yellow">How long has it been?</font>

14
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:45,338
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's good to see you.</font>

15
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:47,178
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

16
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:53,038
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

17
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:54,478
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

18
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:57,538
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

19
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,908
<font color="yellow">You were born in 1986, right?</font>

20
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:05,638
<font color="yellow">- The year of the tiger. - Yes.</font>

21
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:07,378
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

22
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,538
<font color="yellow">Sleep with me tonight!</font>

23
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:20,778
<font color="yellow">All I need is one night.</font>

24
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,608
<font color="yellow">Just one night. Nothing more.</font>

25
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,878
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

26
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,038
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui. Shim Bo Nui.</font>

27
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,208
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

28
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:43,538
<font color="yellow">Let me have a drink before I start talking.</font>

29
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:46,338
<font color="yellow">What did you want to say to me?</font>

30
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:48,608
<font color="yellow">You're making me nervous.</font>

31
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:57,838
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

32
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:00,438
<font color="yellow">Is it you?</font>

33
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:05,938
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

34
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,338
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

35
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,008
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

36
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,708
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

37
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:39,908
<font color="yellow">Look, I...</font>

38
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:45,108
<font color="yellow">I need another drink before I can say this.</font>

39
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:49,108
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, do you...</font>

40
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:51,578
<font color="yellow">have any kind of insurance?</font>

41
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:53,378
<font color="yellow">You know how scary this world has come to.</font>

42
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,138
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

43
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,338
<font color="yellow">Listen to me!</font>

44
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:01,778
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

45
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:09,078
<font color="yellow">I have a favour to ask.</font>

46
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,478
<font color="yellow">I must be out of my mind.</font>

47
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,208
<font color="yellow">I don't have money for insurance.</font>

48
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:20,408
<font color="yellow">(Insurance Policy)</font>

49
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,838
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

50
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:29,508
<font color="yellow">Where's my phone?</font>

51
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,538
<font color="yellow">What in the world happened?</font>

52
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:44,878
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim!</font>

53
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:47,748
<font color="yellow">Hi, where are you?</font>

54
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:49,908
<font color="yellow">Why was it so hard to get a hold of you since yesterday?</font>

55
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,578
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I don't remember anything.</font>

56
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:54,338
<font color="yellow">Did you get drunk?</font>

57
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:55,748
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

58
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:58,378
<font color="yellow">I woke up and found my place a total mess.</font>

59
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:00,338
<font color="yellow">What? Are you okay?</font>

60
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:02,308
<font color="yellow">Did anything happen to you?</font>

61
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:04,778
<font color="yellow">Something should have happened.</font>

62
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,438
<font color="yellow">Born in the year of the tiger?</font>

63
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,108
<font color="yellow">I don't think anything happened.</font>

64
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:50,108
<font color="yellow">Born in the year of the tiger?</font>

65
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:53,578
<font color="yellow">Wait. Wait.</font>

66
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:12,178
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

67
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:21,538
<font color="yellow">Why did you call?</font>

68
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:23,778
<font color="yellow">I have to pay you for the work.</font>

69
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:26,078
<font color="yellow">Send me your bank account and a copy of your ID.</font>

70
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:28,408
<font color="yellow">It's going to take around two weeks.</font>

71
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:31,208
<font color="yellow">That long?</font>

72
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:35,208
<font color="yellow">I need approval to give you four times the regular pay.</font>

73
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,778
<font color="yellow">How much do you need urgently?</font>

74
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,108
<font color="yellow">I'll lend you some.</font>

75
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,238
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I know the situation you're in.</font>

76
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:45,308
<font color="yellow">Thanks, though. Bye.</font>

77
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:49,808
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

78
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,708
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

79
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:17,038
<font color="yellow">I still have a day left.</font>

80
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:19,938
<font color="yellow">Did you change your mind? I'll get paid soon.</font>

81
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,178
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that day.</font>

82
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:27,478
<font color="yellow">You could've told me about your sibling.</font>

83
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,878
<font color="yellow">Oh, did you find out?</font>

84
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,578
<font color="yellow">Every family has a problem they can't talk about.</font>

85
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:36,938
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

86
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,308
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about the rent and take your time.</font>

87
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:41,808
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Of course.</font>

88
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,438
<font color="yellow">You know how soft-hearted I am.</font>

89
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:46,238
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

90
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:47,808
<font color="yellow">Blessings to you.</font>

91
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:50,138
<font color="yellow">I'll pray for you to be showered with blessings.</font>

92
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,478
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Go in.</font>

93
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:53,738
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

94
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:56,738
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Don't light candles in the room.</font>

95
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,438
<font color="yellow">Of course, I won't ever.</font>

96
00:07:58,538 --> 00:07:59,778
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

97
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:05,838
<font color="yellow">You're giving me a break, aren't you?</font>

98
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,738
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

99
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,578
<font color="yellow">What did they say? I'm healthy from head to toe, aren't I?</font>

100
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:40,178
<font color="yellow">I didn't need a check-up.</font>

101
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:42,138
<font color="yellow">You need to get checked up before Wimbledon.</font>

102
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,508
<font color="yellow">You know it's less than a month away.</font>

103
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:44,778
<font color="yellow">I'm not participating.</font>

104
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:46,278
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

105
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:49,238
<font color="yellow">Give me some vacation time. Just two months.</font>

106
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:51,848
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

107
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,238
<font color="yellow">Tennis players don't get vacations.</font>

108
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:56,508
<font color="yellow">Tennis players are human, too.</font>

109
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,578
<font color="yellow">Gary.</font>

110
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,348
<font color="yellow">This is Wimbledon we're talking about.</font>

111
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:01,438
<font color="yellow">What about your score and ranking?</font>

112
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:04,078
<font color="yellow">You're not getting a vacation. Don't even dream about it.</font>

113
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:05,578
<font color="yellow">The association won't approve of it, either.</font>

114
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:08,508
<font color="yellow">- I can if I do poorly on the test. - What?</font>

115
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,848
<font color="yellow">Did you already ask?</font>

116
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:14,508
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I told them. - Gary!</font>

117
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:16,438
<font color="yellow">Amy.</font>

118
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:19,008
<font color="yellow">Use me as an excuse and take a break.</font>

119
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:21,438
<font color="yellow">You don't have a boyfriend because you work too hard.</font>

120
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:24,408
<font color="yellow">I'm not done talking to you. Why do you keep running away?</font>

121
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:26,538
<font color="yellow">- Why? - What are you talking about?</font>

122
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,508
<font color="yellow">- It's the first time I'm out. - Are you sure?</font>

123
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,348
<font color="yellow">Who was the one called me...</font>

124
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,138
<font color="yellow">in the middle of the night to pay for his taxi?</font>

125
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,438
<font color="yellow">You haven't told me where you spent...</font>

126
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,348
<font color="yellow">all the money you exchanged at the airport.</font>

127
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,348
<font color="yellow">I spent it on something very nice for someone in need.</font>

128
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:43,638
<font color="yellow">What the...</font>

129
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,348
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

130
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:13,808
<font color="yellow">(Mum, Bo Nui, Bo Ra and Dad)</font>

131
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,478
<font color="yellow">It's really her, Bo Nui.</font>

132
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,278
<font color="yellow">(Mum, Bo Nui, Bo Ra and Dad)</font>

133
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:47,578
<font color="yellow">Unit 401's overdue rent is all settled now, right?</font>

134
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:48,608
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's all settled.</font>

135
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:53,208
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I didn't know that she had a handsome brother like you.</font>

136
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,708
<font color="yellow">By the way, please don't tell my sister...</font>

137
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,978
<font color="yellow">- that I paid for the rent. - Why?</font>

138
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:02,608
<font color="yellow">Is there a secret behind your birth? Is that it?</font>

139
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:07,908
<font color="yellow">Yes. She might be shocked.</font>

140
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:10,608
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't you worry about that.</font>

141
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,108
<font color="yellow">As long as the rent is paid on time,</font>

142
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:17,238
<font color="yellow">- I won't have to see her. - Thank you.</font>

143
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,178
<font color="yellow">Is it because you look kind? I already feel close to you.</font>

144
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,208
<font color="yellow">You are a decent man.</font>

145
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:05,938
<font color="yellow">Did she just not recognise me?</font>

146
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,008
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

147
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:25,078
<font color="yellow">What? Is it already out?</font>

148
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:31,508
<font color="yellow">It's not. It's not out in the store.</font>

149
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:39,578
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

150
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,708
<font color="yellow">Where did you download the game?</font>

151
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:55,938
<font color="yellow">Gosh, we are in trouble.</font>

152
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,378
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

153
00:12:57,438 --> 00:13:00,008
<font color="yellow">Is it really what I think it is?</font>

154
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,078
<font color="yellow">How are we supposed to solve this problem?</font>

155
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,308
<font color="yellow">It was released in Russia yesterday at midnight.</font>

156
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:17,408
<font color="yellow">It has already been downloaded five million times.</font>

157
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:22,408
<font color="yellow">Genius Two was scheduled to be released after a month. What now?</font>

158
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,008
<font color="yellow">- Did you find out where they are? - Yes.</font>

159
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:27,878
<font color="yellow">They left the country on that day. They've been planning it.</font>

160
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:30,738
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it. Aren't they industrial spies?</font>

161
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:33,338
<font color="yellow">Let's sue them all! Let's report them to the international police.</font>

162
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:34,508
<font color="yellow">She's right.</font>

163
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:38,808
<font color="yellow">Attorney Park is here.</font>

164
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,838
<font color="yellow">So going to Russia now is not going to help.</font>

165
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:45,878
<font color="yellow">Recently, they are tightening regulations.</font>

166
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:49,038
<font color="yellow">But they're not interested in cases against their national interest.</font>

167
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,378
<font color="yellow">Up to this day, the country stands as the capital of software piracy.</font>

168
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:57,208
<font color="yellow">Mr Je.</font>

169
00:13:58,008 --> 00:14:00,338
<font color="yellow">Newspaper companies keep calling.</font>

170
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:01,708
<font color="yellow">They're asking about what happened.</font>

171
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:05,408
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is crazy.</font>

172
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:19,878
<font color="yellow">It is not officially released. How many times do I have to repeat?</font>

173
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:22,808
<font color="yellow">- We have nothing to say about it. - Gosh!</font>

174
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:23,938
<font color="yellow">We will give up...</font>

175
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,208
<font color="yellow">- the release of Genius Two. - What?</font>

176
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,778
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je. - Even if we sue them,</font>

177
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:37,278
<font color="yellow">we will just waste time, and they'd only grant us an injunction.</font>

178
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:39,678
<font color="yellow">Moreover, we cannot release a copycat in the market.</font>

179
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:41,938
<font color="yellow">- But ours is the original. - No.</font>

180
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:44,838
<font color="yellow">The first released one is the original.</font>

181
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:46,808
<font color="yellow">It's our fault that our security had a loophole.</font>

182
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,438
<font color="yellow">So we must take the responsibility.</font>

183
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,178
<font color="yellow">I cannot resign. I have three kids.</font>

184
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:56,278
<font color="yellow">- You're having a third child? - Yes. It just happened.</font>

185
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,938
<font color="yellow">- When is the deadline? - The sooner the better.</font>

186
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:01,278
<font color="yellow">Bring me a new game.</font>

187
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,778
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

188
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,608
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's organise teams.</font>

189
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:10,508
<font color="yellow">Dal Nim and Dae Kwon. Lead one team each, and bring me an alpha version.</font>

190
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:13,538
<font color="yellow">We will have a demonstration event for the new game after a month.</font>

191
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:16,208
<font color="yellow">We will showcase a totally new game, even greater than Genius Two.</font>

192
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,138
<font color="yellow">I will give you two days.</font>

193
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:24,208
<font color="yellow">- Mr Je... - Two days?</font>

194
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:26,538
<font color="yellow">How can we do this?</font>

195
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:28,138
<font color="yellow">Right. If any of you want to resign,</font>

196
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,638
<font color="yellow">I will accept the resignation letter after four weeks.</font>

197
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:36,438
<font color="yellow">Four weeks? Is this a divorce procedure or what?</font>

198
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:38,278
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Gosh.</font>

199
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,308
<font color="yellow">This is a real crisis.</font>

200
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:43,938
<font color="yellow">How can we come up with an idea and work on graphics in just two days?</font>

201
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:47,008
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, that's his way of dismissing us?</font>

202
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:49,338
<font color="yellow">You still don't know he doesn't beat around the bush.</font>

203
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,608
<font color="yellow">We're in an emergency, you know?</font>

204
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:53,908
<font color="yellow">We have to bring our heads together and come up with ideas. Right?</font>

205
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:55,338
<font color="yellow">- Cheers, everyone! We can do it! - Yes. She's right.</font>

206
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:57,808
<font color="yellow">- This is an emergency. - Mr Han!</font>

207
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:58,908
<font color="yellow">Why don't you help us brainstorm...</font>

208
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:02,438
<font color="yellow">- Never mind. Bye. - Can you deliver coffee here?</font>

209
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:04,608
<font color="yellow">I am a major shareholder.</font>

210
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:06,438
<font color="yellow">I hold the biggest share.</font>

211
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:10,408
<font color="yellow">I hold a very high position. Do you know that?</font>

212
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:12,608
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Attorney Park. - Yes.</font>

213
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:15,438
<font color="yellow">- So can you deliver it or not? - Come on.</font>

214
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,578
<font color="yellow">Sew it along this line, okay?</font>

215
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,608
<font color="yellow">That's not how you do it.</font>

216
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,378
<font color="yellow">- You should hurry up. - I'm back.</font>

217
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,808
<font color="yellow">- You're here. - You're here.</font>

218
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:25,038
<font color="yellow">- You're here, Bo Nui! - Hi!</font>

219
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,008
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, Bo Nui. - I'll do it.</font>

220
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,178
<font color="yellow">You are so punctual.</font>

221
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,938
<font color="yellow">Please check it.</font>

222
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:34,908
<font color="yellow">I know how good and meticulous you are.</font>

223
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:38,808
<font color="yellow">Look at this. You've done a beautiful job.</font>

224
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:40,838
<font color="yellow">How much do you want this time?</font>

225
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:45,508
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to stop for a while. - Why?</font>

226
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:49,538
<font color="yellow">Are you doing another part-time job? Do both! You do this at home anyway.</font>

227
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:52,078
<font color="yellow">Some things came up.</font>

228
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:54,978
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

229
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:56,208
<font color="yellow">- Take care. - Take care.</font>

230
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:57,838
<font color="yellow">- Take care. - Bye.</font>

231
00:16:59,378 --> 00:17:01,378
<font color="yellow">I have to find the tiger right away.</font>

232
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,908
<font color="yellow">There are only girls here.</font>

233
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:45,608
<font color="yellow">- Hey! Stop! - Stop it!</font>

234
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,778
<font color="yellow">Turn it down.</font>

235
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:51,238
<font color="yellow">I'm listening to an exciting song to feel better and brainstorm.</font>

236
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:53,308
<font color="yellow">Can anything come out in just two days?</font>

237
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:56,238
<font color="yellow">There is someone who has been staying up all night...</font>

238
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,338
<font color="yellow">- for two days. - He's coming out.</font>

239
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:05,638
<font color="yellow">- The meeting is at 3pm, right? - Yes.</font>

240
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,738
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Yes.</font>

241
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:12,378
<font color="yellow">Submit your work by 2:30pm.</font>

242
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:19,078
<font color="yellow">Please check the sources I sent. Hurry.</font>

243
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:22,578
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking coffee.</font>

244
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:26,408
<font color="yellow">- Give it back. - How long have you been up?</font>

245
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:28,738
<font color="yellow">For 42 hours and 30 minutes. Give it back. I have a meeting coming up.</font>

246
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,838
<font color="yellow">If you die, my shares will worth nothing.</font>

247
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:34,838
<font color="yellow">Have some fruits. It gives you vitamin C. How great is that?</font>

248
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:37,238
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

249
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:41,278
<font color="yellow">When you sit down for too long, you will get constipated. Drink it.</font>

250
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:42,478
<font color="yellow">More. That's it. Good boy.</font>

251
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,178
<font color="yellow">How are the new game ideas? Is it good or bad?</font>

252
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:54,408
<font color="yellow">Please don't talk.</font>

253
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,178
<font color="yellow">- Please show me your ID. - What?</font>

254
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:13,908
<font color="yellow">- Even when I'm buying these? - They're changing the law.</font>

255
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:15,178
<font color="yellow">I will check it quickly.</font>

256
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,308
<font color="yellow">Please show me your ID.</font>

257
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,938
<font color="yellow">Do I look that young?</font>

258
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:30,578
<font color="yellow">I am from Class Fruit of Saetbyeol Kindergarten.</font>

259
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,908
<font color="yellow">I am seven years old, and my name is Ji Yeon Woo.</font>

260
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:35,308
<font color="yellow">You were born on the year of the tiger.</font>

261
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,438
<font color="yellow">Good luck. Here.</font>

262
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,408
<font color="yellow">It's 20 cents.</font>

263
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:44,378
<font color="yellow">Statistically, 1 out of 12 people should be a tiger.</font>

264
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:46,138
<font color="yellow">Why can't I see any?</font>

265
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,678
<font color="yellow">You are adorable.</font>

266
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,808
<font color="yellow">Hey. Can you get me one of your cousins?</font>

267
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,738
<font color="yellow">Thank you for listening.</font>

268
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,838
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

269
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:21,578
<font color="yellow">That was okay, right?</font>

270
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:25,778
<font color="yellow">Three-match puzzle for killing time is addicting and nice...</font>

271
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,838
<font color="yellow">except that the other companies already came up with it.</font>

272
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:35,138
<font color="yellow">How many of those games disappeared just this year?</font>

273
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:41,478
<font color="yellow">Honestly, what do you expect us to do in two days?</font>

274
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:53,008
<font color="yellow">Are we here to create a work of art?</font>

275
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:58,048
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to extend the deadline as long as you want...</font>

276
00:20:58,108 --> 00:21:00,438
<font color="yellow">and beg you to come up with a masterpiece?</font>

277
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:03,678
<font color="yellow">Or has Zeze Factory become a charity organisation without my knowledge?</font>

278
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,108
<font color="yellow">A charity organisation...</font>

279
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:09,708
<font color="yellow">Everyone, this company...</font>

280
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:11,638
<font color="yellow">is Zeze Factory.</font>

281
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,238
<font color="yellow">If you could give us a little more time,</font>

282
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:17,208
<font color="yellow">we'll come up with a revised plan.</font>

283
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,578
<font color="yellow">I'll give you four days.</font>

284
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:22,878
<font color="yellow">You don't need to work too hard. Just do a proper job.</font>

285
00:21:23,938 --> 00:21:26,438
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Understood.</font>

286
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:30,838
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - This is crazy.</font>

287
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:38,808
<font color="yellow">Here it is. I hope you enjoy it.</font>

288
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:42,138
<font color="yellow">Sir, you've been running this pub since the IT Centre opened, right?</font>

289
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:44,238
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

290
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:46,608
<font color="yellow">Your customers chat a lot, don't they?</font>

291
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:49,038
<font color="yellow">Have you heard any good ideas?</font>

292
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,338
<font color="yellow">It could be ideas they decided not to pursue.</font>

293
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:52,808
<font color="yellow">A hidden gem might be found among them.</font>

294
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,278
<font color="yellow">Why do you need ideas? You guys are the best in the industry.</font>

295
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:57,438
<font color="yellow">Please ignore him. He's just babbling.</font>

296
00:21:57,938 --> 00:21:58,938
<font color="yellow">I'm not babbling.</font>

297
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:01,478
<font color="yellow">I'm concerned about the company as the main shareholder.</font>

298
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,538
<font color="yellow">I heard you caused another ruckus today.</font>

299
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:06,508
<font color="yellow">- Me? - Yes.</font>

300
00:22:06,878 --> 00:22:09,538
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who doesn't remember.</font>

301
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:11,378
<font color="yellow">Don't be harsh on them, please.</font>

302
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:13,478
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if they quit?</font>

303
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:16,338
<font color="yellow">If we line up those who want to join Zeze, the line will be so long.</font>

304
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:18,678
<font color="yellow">And will any of them be able to satisfy you?</font>

305
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:21,138

456
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:55,408
<font color="yellow">Look through the eyes of the player, and play sports with their body.</font>

457
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:58,608
<font color="yellow">This is "IF", the experiencing game by Daebak Soft.</font>

458
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:02,678
<font color="yellow">(Look through the eyes of the player and play sports with their body.)</font>

459
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,738
<font color="yellow">(You no longer watch they play, but you play it yourself.)</font>

460
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:09,978
<font color="yellow">You play IF through the first-person perspective.</font>

461
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:13,338
<font color="yellow">For example, it's easy to create games that are played alone...</font>

462
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,338
<font color="yellow">like ski jumping.</font>

463
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:21,708
<font color="yellow">Or the games that require only two players...</font>

464
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:24,138
<font color="yellow">like kendo.</font>

465
00:31:27,738 --> 00:31:30,208
<font color="yellow">However, sports that require more players...</font>

466
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:33,378
<font color="yellow">can be very dynamic as well...</font>

467
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:36,108
<font color="yellow">as long as you focus on the game's characteristics...</font>

468
00:31:36,178 --> 00:31:37,178
<font color="yellow">through the first-person perspective.</font>

469
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:43,978
<font color="yellow">I know there have been console games...</font>

470
00:31:44,078 --> 00:31:47,378
<font color="yellow">that allowed you to enjoy sports by using movement sensors.</font>

471
00:31:47,978 --> 00:31:50,208
<font color="yellow">However, we've added one more thing!</font>

472
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:53,278
<font color="yellow">What if you can become Kim Yuna...</font>

473
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:56,238
<font color="yellow">or Park Ji Sung?</font>

474
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:58,878
<font color="yellow">You can not only play sports through their perspectives...</font>

475
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:01,778
<font color="yellow">but also live their lives...</font>

476
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,978
<font color="yellow">through the perspectives of the star athletes.</font>

477
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:06,078
<font color="yellow">Virtual reality?</font>

478
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:28,638
<font color="yellow">This was IF, the sports experience game by Daebak Soft.</font>

479
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,278
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

480
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:46,308
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

481
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:49,208
<font color="yellow">Mr Won should have been here...</font>

482

485
00:32:56,178 --> 00:32:59,478
<font color="yellow">I'm Shim Bo Nui, an employee of Daebak Soft.</font>

486
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,978
<font color="yellow">- Shim Bo Nui? - What should we do about this?</font>

487
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,278
<font color="yellow">Shim Bo Nui?</font>

488
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:07,938
<font color="yellow">She's my friend.</font>

489
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,678
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't call me like this if she's one of them.</font>

490
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,508
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Bo Nui. - I'm Shim Bo Nui.</font>

491

<font color="yellow">(The cleaning lady, the bunny, the drunk girl...)</font>

493
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:24,308
<font color="yellow">(and the presentation raccoon are the same person.)</font>

494
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:30,638
<font color="yellow">I know it's against the rules...</font>

495
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,878
<font color="yellow">to have someone else stand in for the presentation.</font>

496
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,308
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

497
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:37,338
<font color="yellow">I thought it was a waste.</font>

498
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:40,178
<font color="yellow">I tried hard to design this game.</font>

499
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:42,978
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your time.</font>

500
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:45,078
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

501
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:55,138
<font color="yellow">Ms Shim Bo Nui?</font>

502
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:59,538
<font color="yellow">You were the bunny at the demonstration, right?</font>

503
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:04,778
<font color="yellow">Did you torture Dal Nim to find me?</font>

504
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,478
<font color="yellow">I'm really not an industrial spy.</font>

505
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:11,948
<font color="yellow">Also, I don't have the strength to talk to you right now.</font>

506
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:13,678
<font color="yellow">You acted suspicious.</font>

507
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,108
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm sorry.</font>

508
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:21,338
<font color="yellow">I guess you love animals very much.</font>

509
00:34:21,408 --> 00:34:23,278
<font color="yellow">Or is it more like an obsession?</font>

510
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:26,538
<font color="yellow">- A rabbit. - I said it's not!</font>

511
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:27,608
<font color="yellow">Take it off!</font>

512
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,678
<font color="yellow">A bear.</font>

513
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:33,978
<font color="yellow">A raccoon and a tiger.</font>

514
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:36,138
<font color="yellow">Were you born in the year of the tiger?</font>

515
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:38,008
<font color="yellow">Were any of you born in that year?</font>

516
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:41,608
<font color="yellow">How is your bear? How about the tiger?</font>

517
00:34:42,408 --> 00:34:43,908
<font color="yellow">- Did you find your tiger? - Well...</font>

518
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:46,578
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

519
00:34:47,908 --> 00:34:49,108
<font color="yellow">Do you remember what happened that day?</font>

520
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:51,238
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking for you to be grateful.</font>

521
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:10,078
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking for an apology, either.</font>

522
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:13,038
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

523
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,308
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember what you did to me when you were drunk?</font>

524
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:18,638
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

525
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:22,208
<font color="yellow">I have plans. I should get going. Bye!</font>

526
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:23,278
<font color="yellow">Wait a second!</font>

527
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,538
<font color="yellow">I think she remembers.</font>

528
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,878
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Why did I give the presentation?</font>

529
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,608
<font color="yellow">My life is full of regrets.</font>

530
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:39,178
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Where were you, Mr Won?</font>

531
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:42,208
<font color="yellow">I fell asleep at the sauna.</font>

532
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,808
<font color="yellow">How did it go? Did you give the presentation?</font>

533
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,948
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. I wore this during the presentation.</font>

534
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:50,078
<font color="yellow">Did you do a good job? I know you did.</font>

535
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:52,978
<font color="yellow">I would've stuttered the whole time.</font>

536
00:35:53,538 --> 00:35:54,578
<font color="yellow">You did a good job, right?</font>

537
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:57,878
<font color="yellow">Like I said, it was impossible to finish in a day.</font>

538
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:01,108
<font color="yellow">I thought this would work.</font>

539
00:36:02,278 --> 00:36:04,008
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry you had to miss your part-time job for this.</font>

540
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:07,838
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll look for something else.</font>

541
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:10,948
<font color="yellow">I have your car registration,</font>

542
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,038
<font color="yellow">so get it when you have the money.</font>

543
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,678
<font color="yellow">How much was it?</font>

544
00:36:15,078 --> 00:36:17,808
<font color="yellow">- I was joking. I know. - I should get going.</font>

545
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:21,508
<font color="yellow">Can you take this back to where they have children's plays?</font>

546
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:22,678
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Got it.</font>

547
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:26,508
<font color="yellow">Bo Nui, I have this with me. It's the idea box.</font>

548
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:29,238
<font color="yellow">I'll come up with something, so good luck until then!</font>

549
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,278
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

550
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:39,408
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

551
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:50,838
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

552
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:58,808
<font color="yellow">- Me? - Yes.</font>

553
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:00,678
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

554
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,308
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

555
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:11,678
<font color="yellow">You're moving in. Which apartment are you?</font>

556
00:37:11,738 --> 00:37:12,778
<font color="yellow">It's 402.</font>

557
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:15,908
<font color="yellow">Don't you recognise me?</font>

558
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:20,778
<font color="yellow">You might have seen me on the news.</font>

559
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:25,508
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

560
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,908
<font color="yellow">a reporter? You don't look like one, though.</font>

561
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:37,278
<font color="yellow">I don't watch the news. They talk about too many crimes.</font>

562
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:40,608
<font color="yellow">I can't afford to shoulder the suffering of others.</font>

563
00:37:41,408 --> 00:37:42,408
<font color="yellow">Good luck on your move.</font>

564
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:43,978
<font color="yellow">- Wait. - Oh, right.</font>

565
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,338
<font color="yellow">This is nothing, but it's a welcome gift.</font>

566
00:37:47,878 --> 00:37:50,638
<font color="yellow">It's nice to have a candle. It's pretty useful.</font>

567

00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:27,838
<font color="yellow">Mr Je?</font>

571
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:33,038
<font color="yellow">- About Ms Shim Bo Nui... - She really isn't a spy.</font>

572
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:36,278
<font color="yellow">She's not the type to be a good spy.</font>

573

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

580
00:38:57,178 --> 00:38:58,448
<font color="yellow">I found out by accident.</font>

581
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:01,738
<font color="yellow">She doesn't work there since her boss ran away without paying her.</font>

582
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:04,538
<font color="yellow">She developed the software, did the sales and did everything.</font>

583
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:08,338

<font color="yellow">Do you think I asked anyone to help us?</font>

585
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:14,378
<font color="yellow">She wasn't able to graduate, but she majored in computer science.</font>

<font color="yellow">They can solve it if they take time with it.</font>

607
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,538
<font color="yellow">They should be diligent if they aren't smart.</font>

610
00:41:02,478 --> 00:41:05,448

<font color="yellow">- Let's give up. - Why?</font>

612
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:08,478
<font color="yellow">No one will be hired.</font>

613
00:41:08,538 --> 00:41:10,238
<font color="yellow">It's our first open recruitment, though.</font>

614

<font color="yellow">Let's wait a bit more and see.</font>

615
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,238
<font color="yellow">Not a single person will be hired.</font>

616
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:15,308

00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:35,408
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Sorry?</font>

625
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:37,608

<font color="yellow">I know I shouldn't expect to be lucky.</font>

632
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:16,078
<font color="yellow">I was foolish to get my hopes up once again.</font>

633

<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

634

641
00:42:49,948 --> 00:42:52,638
<font color="yellow">I'll be okay even without seeing her again.</font>

642
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:00,108
<font color="yellow">Is someone knocking my door?</font>

643
00:43:08,678 --> 00:43:09,678
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

644
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:12,448
<font color="yellow">I'm your next-door neighbour.</font>

645
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,308
<font color="yellow">Do you have a hammer?</font>

646
00:43:23,578 --> 00:43:25,678
<font color="yellow">She turned out as a nasty tempered girl.</font>

647
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,238
<font color="yellow">Be careful with it.</font>

648
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,108
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

649
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:49,538
<font color="yellow">I can recognise her face as a kid the more I see her.</font>

650
00:43:51,538 --> 00:43:52,538
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

651
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:54,138
<font color="yellow">how can she not recognise me?</font>

652
00:43:54,638 --> 00:43:56,078
<font color="yellow">I'm the cutie-pie, Geon Uk.</font>

653
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:10,408
<font color="yellow">You can just leave it in front of the door.</font>

654
00:44:11,478 --> 00:44:12,778
<font color="yellow">She won't even open the door for me.</font>

655
00:44:13,938 --> 00:44:15,538
<font color="yellow">Could I also borrow plasters from you?</font>

656
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,238
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt?</font>

657
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:20,608
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

658
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:22,978
<font color="yellow">I told you to be careful!</font>

659
00:44:30,778 --> 00:44:31,778
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

660
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:37,308
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

661
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:54,638
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

662
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,508
<font color="yellow">Are you okay now?</font>

663
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,038
<font color="yellow">You should be careful.</font>

664
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:18,638
<font color="yellow">You should be extra careful...</font>

665
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:21,608
<font color="yellow">since you live next door.</font>

666
00:45:22,938 --> 00:45:24,978
<font color="yellow">I'm not supposed talk to or open the door to strangers.</font>

667
00:45:25,038 --> 00:45:26,608
<font color="yellow">I can't really lend things to strangers, either.</font>

668
00:45:27,378 --> 00:45:28,538
<font color="yellow">They say neighbours are like your family.</font>

669
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:31,208
<font color="yellow">No one thinks like that these days.</font>

670
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:35,138
<font color="yellow">Anyway, if you need anything from now on,</font>

671
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,808
<font color="yellow">ask other neighbours or just buy it.</font>

672
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,038
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

673
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:44,508
<font color="yellow">- Let's go out for food. - Pardon me?</font>

674
00:45:44,738 --> 00:45:47,038
<font color="yellow">You opened the door for me, lent me your hammer and put this on as well.</font>

675
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:49,008
<font color="yellow">You said you never do things like that.</font>

676
00:45:49,308 --> 00:45:51,678
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you to thank you for your special favour.</font>

677
00:45:52,938 --> 00:45:54,478
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the offer. I'll just accept the gesture.</font>

678
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:55,538
<font color="yellow">I'm too busy these days.</font>

679
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:56,708
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

680
00:45:57,008 --> 00:45:58,908
<font color="yellow">No matter how busy you are, you still eat, don't you?</font>

681
00:45:58,978 --> 00:45:59,978
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

682
00:46:00,678 --> 00:46:03,308
<font color="yellow">Please don't mistake my kindness for flirting.</font>

683
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:05,278
<font color="yellow">You should respect your neighbours' preferences.</font>

684
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:07,478
<font color="yellow">These days, people don't like to become close to their neighbours.</font>

685
00:46:13,678 --> 00:46:15,538
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is wrong with me today?</font>

686
00:46:17,578 --> 00:46:19,608
<font color="yellow">I'm actually quite famous.</font>

687
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:21,238
<font color="yellow">You might regret this later.</font>

688
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:25,838
<font color="yellow">My life is already full of regrets.</font>

689
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,878
<font color="yellow">Whether you're famous or not, I'm not interested at all...</font>

690
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,408
<font color="yellow">unless you were born in the year of the tiger.</font>

691
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:33,838
<font color="yellow">What if I was?</font>

692
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:37,708
<font color="yellow">Is your Chinese zodiac sign the tiger?</font>

693
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:40,138
<font color="yellow">If it is, would you go out for a meal with me?</font>

694
00:46:41,238 --> 00:46:42,508
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

695
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:46,038
<font color="yellow">Let's go for food. I think I qualify.</font>

696
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:48,208
<font color="yellow">You're serious, right? Your sign is really the tiger?</font>

697
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:50,238
<font color="yellow">When shall we go? How about now?</font>

698
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,238
<font color="yellow">You should repay kindness as soon as possible.</font>

699
00:46:52,538 --> 00:46:54,208
<font color="yellow">I have to unpack and organise my stuff today.</font>

700
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,908
<font color="yellow">How about tomorrow? When do you get off work?</font>

701
00:46:56,408 --> 00:46:57,408
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that.</font>

702
00:46:57,478 --> 00:46:59,478
<font color="yellow">I won't go to work at all. I'll stay at home all day long,</font>

703
00:46:59,538 --> 00:47:01,238
<font color="yellow">so we can go out for dinner or lunch.</font>

704
00:47:01,578 --> 00:47:02,578
<font color="yellow">Would lunch be weird?</font>

705
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:03,838
<font color="yellow">Then let's go for dinner tomorrow.</font>

706
00:47:04,508 --> 00:47:05,508
<font color="yellow">You'll be surprised.</font>

707
00:47:06,308 --> 00:47:07,308
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

708
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:09,678
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

709
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:12,078
<font color="yellow">Bring your identification card.</font>

710
00:47:20,108 --> 00:47:21,308
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

711
00:47:22,278 --> 00:47:24,378
<font color="yellow">You sent the tiger to the flat next to mine.</font>

712
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,738
<font color="yellow">Don't be too surprised and run away!</font>

713
00:47:41,078 --> 00:47:42,178
<font color="yellow">Okay, that was good.</font>

714
00:47:42,408 --> 00:47:44,678
<font color="yellow">This time, try moving your right arm all the way.</font>

715
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,078
<font color="yellow">You saw that, right? When you serve,</font>

716
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:57,378
<font color="yellow">you should stretch your left arm from here to all the way up.</font>

717
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,078
<font color="yellow">Please let me know when the article is ready.</font>

718
00:47:59,308 --> 00:48:00,308
<font color="yellow">Sure, I will.</font>

719
00:48:05,808 --> 00:48:06,808
<font color="yellow">Stretch your arm all the way.</font>

720
00:48:10,008 --> 00:48:11,008
<font color="yellow">Okay. Do that again.</font>

721
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:13,338
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

722
00:48:13,638 --> 00:48:14,638
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

723
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:21,038
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, Mr Choi. - Goodbye, Mr Choi.</font>

724
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:22,478
<font color="yellow">Bye. See you later.</font>

725
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:24,408
<font color="yellow">- Gary Choi, you're the best! - Thanks!</font>

726
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:25,938
<font color="yellow">Where are you staying now?</font>

727
00:48:26,878 --> 00:48:27,878
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

728
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:30,338
<font color="yellow">You didn't think I'd find out if you didn't check out from the hotel?</font>

729
00:48:31,738 --> 00:48:32,738
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

730
00:48:32,938 --> 00:48:34,038
<font color="yellow">Why are you really being like this?</font>

731
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,938
<font color="yellow">You dropped the bomb on me and even ran away.</font>

732
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:37,608
<font color="yellow">Staying at a hotel is no fun.</font>

733
00:48:37,978 --> 00:48:39,378
<font color="yellow">I'm back in Korea after living abroad for so long.</font>

734
00:48:40,338 --> 00:48:41,338
<font color="yellow">Let me have some fun.</font>

735
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:44,178
<font color="yellow">You used to hate it whenever I brought up anything about Korea.</font>

736
00:48:45,138 --> 00:48:46,178
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

737
00:48:46,238 --> 00:48:48,638
<font color="yellow">I thought it was strange that you accepted the sponsorship.</font>

738
00:48:48,808 --> 00:48:49,978
<font color="yellow">You saw it the other day.</font>

739
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:51,808
<font color="yellow">All those fans were going crazy for me.</font>

740
00:48:52,578 --> 00:48:54,038
<font color="yellow">Had I known how popular I was in Korea,</font>

741
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:55,808
<font color="yellow">I would've visited a long time ago.</font>

742
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:57,708
<font color="yellow">Tell me where you're staying now!</font>

743
00:48:57,778 --> 00:48:59,278
<font color="yellow">You don't even know anyone in Seoul.</font>

744
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:01,938
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

745
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:03,438
<font color="yellow">I've launched a boat on the ocean.</font>

746
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:05,878
<font color="yellow">Is it that place?</font>

747
00:49:05,938 --> 00:49:08,778
<font color="yellow">That old drawer works better than I expected.</font>

748
00:49:09,038 --> 00:49:10,538
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

749
00:49:10,878 --> 00:49:13,978
<font color="yellow">Hey, you can't live in a place like that. You're Gary Choi.</font>

750
00:49:16,878 --> 00:49:17,978
<font color="yellow">I've been away for 15 years.</font>

751
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:21,208
<font color="yellow">I'm back in Korea after being away for 15 years.</font>

752
00:49:22,178 --> 00:49:24,108
<font color="yellow">Give me some time. I won't cause trouble.</font>

753
00:49:26,938 --> 00:49:28,778
<font color="yellow">Just give me two months, okay?</font>

754
00:49:30,178 --> 00:49:31,178
<font color="yellow">I'll take that as a yes.</font>

755
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,978
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Is he kidding or serious right now?</font>

756
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:38,708
<font color="yellow">Yes, two months.</font>

757
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:41,008
<font color="yellow">No, it won't take that long.</font>
